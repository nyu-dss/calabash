journal of caribbean arts & letters (as data, almost)

## info

slightly different from our other repotting projects (see [nyu-dss/repotting-template](https://github.com/nyu-dss/repotting-template/)), this journal's website will be taken down and the articles moved into nyu's institutional repository, the [faculty digital archive](https://archive.nyu.edu/). while the articles will continue to open access and easily discoverable, we are also preparing them for long-term preservation.
