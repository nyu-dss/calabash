Sea Jazz

Sea jazz is...

The rolling crash of shoreline cymbals
At each salty climax.

The mnemonic note
Of the sax wailing
Against a backdrop of azure blues

The frothy pianissismo of low tide
Tickling my earlobes.

The cool splash of soloist conjuring up
Billie, Dizzy, Ella, Sarah and the Duke
With one sweet wave of melody.

The heavy strum of the double bass leaving
Soft, indelible prints in the rhythmic sands
Of time.

See? Jazz.
