Untitled IV

I packed:

Dry leaves, a toothbrush, a file

And went up into the mountain

To sleep.

I washed down on a wave
Awakened to rain, purring sky
Curled up in my lap, strong coffee.
The land seeped between my scales
I have been judged

Smooth

Whole

Now, seemingly seamless

I am more.

I walk east in search of tomorrow
And new words, like rows of gleaming teeth
Smile behind ink-stained hands.
