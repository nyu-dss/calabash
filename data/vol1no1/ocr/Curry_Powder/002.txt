60 / Christian A. Campbell

Calabash

You know how people go, it took many deaths

And many births for the Mullchansinghs to talk

To the Brathwaites again and, finally, Mummy

And her siblings were born looking Indian enough.
But Panday in power now and mummy warned

Me to say Indian and not coolie, One of my cousins
Told me, with grown up intuition, You know,

In Trinidad you not black, you dougla.

Panday in power now and my cousins still cuss
About neighbors with their flags of many colors
Claiming their yard for as many gods as there are
Colors. After enough cussing, we all go to eating
Pelau with roti and curry, and so, with our fingers
Stained yellow like old documents,

We, too, stink of curry powder.
