Curry Powder

Panday in power now, somebody cries.
They think they better than people,
My Trini cousins say, And they like
Wear Fila shoes. My brother and I
Laugh and add, they is smell strong

Like curry powder. Is true, we insist.

Coolies and niggers fighting these days

But great-grandmummy Nita did not fight
When she found herself facing the West
Instead, touching the Negro face of a Bajan,
Manny. She did not wear saris no more.
Calypso she liked and could wind down
With the best of them. She became deaf

To the ethereal melody of Krishna’s flute.
She chose Manny, not Lord Rama in her
Hindu epic gone wrong. At her wedding
She never once uttered Ganesh’s name

And she loosed the grasp of Vishnu’s

Four hands from ‘round her waist.

So her sister's disowned her in the holy
Name of Mother India. But she made
Dougla babies anyway and did not give
Then the sacred names of gods: Brahma,
Shiva, Gauri. She named Granddaddy

Leon, a good English name, like all the other
Rootless Negroes. And so Trinidad became herself.
