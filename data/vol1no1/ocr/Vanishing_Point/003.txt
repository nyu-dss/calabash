clouds, soaring borders backmoonlit, illuminated underneath, briefly, by veils of lightning,

“It looks like a nightscape from that museum, doesn’t it?” she asked.

The man cupped his free hand around the near ear, jabbed the cane twice at the surf tumbling in
froth and breaking beside them.

“That's called something,” she said, pointing to the darkest horizon, leaning towards him, “way
out there,” near shouting. “What is it?”

The night tore suddenly apart and a rippling shaft of light fell across the water towards them, as
if the painter had scraped a temperamental swath, leaving the bare canvas exposed.

The man’s lips appeared to shape several syllables she lost to the wind and the sea.

“It has something to do with perspective, doesn’t it?”

The man shook his head at the light. Her thumb rubbed two fingers, back and forth.

They walked on, the lightning preceding them up the beach, outpacing them. The man stopped
suddenly, and when she looked back at him, the cane twice stabbed the air over his shoulder. They
turned. The woman looked for the line of light that would be the pier, but the distance was all black.
Before they had gone many steps, the fog met them, descended over the surf, the sand.

The woman called out, “Have you ever seen anything like this before? Or nothing,” then laughed
aloud. She reached beside her, eased her steps one after another towards the surf, felt nothing.

Keeping the crash to her left, she went on towards where she knew the pier must be, calling out,
reaching, turning back to shout above the sea. She hurried, tried to hurry, in the dark, in the sand,
until something refused to give, stubbed her toes painfully back. Her fingers discovered an old piling
almost buried, a corroded nail that had nearly pierced her foot, and she knew she had made the pier
at least. From there she could almost make out the yellowed lights of the motel entrance, but there
was no one at the desk. The elevator never came. She took the stairs two at a time, panting in the
empty stairwell. The key fell, bounced from the carpet, glanced against the doorjamb. The wall switch
was in the third place her hand landed; the stretching form beneath the orange blanket lay dry, snor-
ing, drew a scaly elbow over its eyes. Her hand too rose over her head, but fell, and she with it onto
the opposite bed, the breath collapsed out of her, eyes on the rising and falling outline of the form.
Then she felt her covers had been turned down and felt at the blend of pillow and mattress a paper
scrap. From one hand she read the single scrawled line—Knew you'd make it too. Good night—while
on the other the thumb unnoticed rubbed the palps of two fingers again and again.

She asked: “When you look at the sea, what do you think of?”
“Hardly the image of eternity.

“The shark that never sleeps turns teeth towards the hapless seal.
“All that life. All that death beneath that sometimes placid surface.
