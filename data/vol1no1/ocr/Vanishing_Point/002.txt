fronting them in the near distance.

“Which way? The pier?”

The man shrugged.

To right and left as they trod the boards the crowded hopeful cast lines, hooks, traps, baskets over
the railing in a ragged succession of confident splashes. A toothless man chuckled to no one in par-
ticular that he was sure their luck would turn with the tide. “Expecting a grouper myself.” The young
woman smiled at him in passing and he doffed his watch cap, gave an empty grin. The couple con-
tinued, stood a moment at the very end squinting amid the flashing waters, then turned, the cane
ringing against the planks with popped, rusted, bent nails. On either side the casting continued until
a boy, with a groan, haled from the water a slender gray shape wriggling into space, writhing onto
the planks with a sharp slap. All turned, some murmuring, and the couple stood not ten halting paces
from the sleek white belly and the swept fins of the tail beating rhythmically against the hollow
boards. The boy bent to touch his prize, but the toothless man said it wasn’t dead yet and to bang
its head. No one moved. With both hands the toothless man battened the cap to his head before lift-
ing the gray tail and swinging the whole length to the boards. It bent and sounded like a rubber
tube. He did it three times more and left it lying, flanks heaving with gills that opened and closed
on seeps of blood. The boy laid a delicate finger on its dorsal fin, sprang back when the shape jerked
away. He grasped, heaved, the shape almost as long as he was tall, and dropped it to the boards,
where it shuddered once from nose to tail, then lay still.

The young woman wondered if she could touch it. The peeling face squinted up at her with its
chapped smile. “Sure. It’s only a baby but be careful. It still might be nervous. Its nerves might be
alive still.” From the nose back it was slippery smooth, but it in the other direction it caught to the
skin of two stroking fingers. She looked up to the man. “It feels like a cat's tongue.” Just as her fin-
gertips closed on the eyes again, the black stare, the shape twitched, jerked a second time violently.
The boy snatched at the tail and brought down the head and fins vigorously. Dark lines jetted over
the ringing boards, scarlet spray fanned across the woman’s bare legs. The boy stood guard, but it
did not move again. He squeezed it beneath a bare foot, turned its white belly to the sun with
stubbed toes. The curved needles of teeth hung through foaming blood in the open slit of mouth.
With a tissue from her pocket, the woman wiped at her knees, shins. She took the man’s elbow as
she stood, whispered something at his ear, and they left the pier, her thumb rubbing again and again
the palps of two fingers.

“They can’t seem to forget,” she laughed towards the man, rubbing two fingers with a thumb as

they walked out along the strand, beneath the obscure profile of a broken moon, occasional flashes
out to sea, the pier diminishing at their backs. She pointed across him to a long mass of billowing
