opened the door, then resumed snapping clippers smartly over five bare toes.
“Some of them think it’s a miracle,” the woman said.
“They would.”
“They all thought they were going to get it this time.”

The man snapped a last careful time, returned the clippers to his pocket, still staring at his feet.
“They will.”

“Yes,” the woman said, “they will, won't they?”

He shifted one leg to the floor, with both hands lifted the other and settled it in a chair,

“Time for this then?” She knocked on the lid of the trunk, received no response, sat at the end
of the opposite bed, gazing, vaguely listening to the hollow sound as the man began tapping the
cane steadily against the pallid foot in front of him. She found her mind counting twentytwo twen-
tythree before she stood, went to the dresser and began rattling open empty drawers, one after
another, top to bottom, left to right, until from one she drew out a folded brownpaper bag, enlarged

it with a fist thrust inside, Releasing the clasps of the trunk, throwing up the lid, she began to stuff
the bag with bright clothes.

The man watched her, lifting and dropping the cane steadily.

“Do you have everything you need?”

She hesitated, a sky blue blouse in her hand, but did not turn.

“More than a year and that’s all you can say?”

“A year isn’t really such a long time.”

“For who?”

The hollow sound continued steadily.

“Or is it whom?”

From her sorting a yellow article tumbled out, fell to the floor. She kicked it aside with a flick of

her ankle. “You gave me that. You can keep it.”

“You always said this day would come.” She whisked a hand over her brow. “One more thing you
were right about.”

The man shrugged unnoticed. “It’s always best to bow to inevitability.”

“You always said the fascination would wither, didn’t you? Along with everything else.”

He nodded. “Something like that.”

“Yeah yeah. You knew all this would happen. You’d been solitary before, you’d know solitude
again. You know everything. As if that made any difference. Yeah yeah you said that too.”

“First you'd lose one leg, then the other, then your hands would become claws then rags and your
eyes would fail. Your tongue would grow still. You'd lose your hair, your teeth, your so forth and so

on, not necessarily in that order of course, everything but flatus. Isn’t that it, you wouldn’t be able
to move, see, feel, speak, or screw, right? Just shrug and fart?”
