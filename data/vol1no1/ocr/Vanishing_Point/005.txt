“What are you reading now?”

He held up a broad cracked spine briefly for her inspection.
“Gibbon?” she squinted. “Gibbons? About the monkeys?”
“That’s the author.”

“Wouldn’t you like to go see what the tide washed up today?”
“Won't it be roughly the same flotsam and jetsam as yesterday?”
“Who knows?” the woman said, smiling.

The man opened his book, nodded into it.

“True.”

She waited, dozed, rose eventually, took the stairs slowly, lingered in her footsteps at the dune,
eyes lifted, but he was still lying there, a book hovering over a body at rest. She walked alone
through gentle breezes, saw no one among the remnants of yesterday's castles crumbling all the
while. Then she heard his voice so clearly that she turned on her tracks, but it was only a remark he
had made during a lecture long before: Words are the sand of thought’s castles. She was not aware

that she had forgotten that to remember it. Or the other way about.

Rain fell. Winds gusted and the birds ceased to fly. The manager said all would be prepared,
should that be necessary, they needn’t do anything. The chambermaids spoke elbow to elbow in the
corridors.

“Did you understand them?”

“One said what do you expect and another said yes, it’s the time of torments. As for the rest—
"—he shrugged.

In the town, beneath a lowering sky the color of wet streets, the couple passed merchant win-
dows covered with planks and boards or taped with crosses. A man, black suit glazed with water,
dark hair bewildered with wind, stood at the intersection of two long avenues, his arm crooked
round a corner lamppost. He opened his mouth wide, but the woman heard him only when she was
close enough to see that where his eyes should have been dark they were milky white and where
they should have been white they were all red. “Now does mankind reap the whirlwind.” Pausing
long enough to toss some coins that each rang once in a watery tray at his feet, she hurried on.
Further down the way, directed by the cane, she slid coins into a paperbox and drew out the news.
They stared at the ambiguous headlines, the uncertain maps, the possible paths of least atmospheric
resistance and the likely routes of greatest destruction. She stepped carefully amid puddles the man
seemed not to notice.

“You'll rust that ferrule too.”

“That would happen anyway.”
