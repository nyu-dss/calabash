“Poor pitiful. Him and all his failings. It’s disgusting. You can go to hell all by yourself.”

She resumed sorting, more slowly.

“You said you'd show all of the world you knew.”

“That seemed the only possible promise.”

“Right—that and that every mentor becomes a tormentor.”

Her eyes narrowed on his profile again.

“Well to be so goddamn wise all the time, you aren’t very smart. Even for a quasipod. That's the
term you like to use, isn’t it?”

With a sudden lift of both hands she upended the open trunk, which had borne witness to like
conversations but never yet taken such a tumbling. Both of them watched the dark clothes sprawl
over the floor. Then the room was quiet once more.

“Well, do you?”

“WHAT?”

“Have everything you need.”

“Enough,”

She roughed the top of the bag into a closed crease, flung a small purse by the strap over one

shoulder, reached the door, clapped it shut behind her, walked steadily down the hall.
“Tess.”

“Resa?”

Silence again. 2
