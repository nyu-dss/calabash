“Very much like here.”
UAE

Late in the morning, coming down into the lounge, they found a crowd of guests collected
around the television.

“What’s happened?”

“Nothing.”

“Storm's coming though.”

“Weather changes fast here.”

The forecaster on screen spoke of a trough of low pressure that once sat off a distant coast, in
another hemisphere, and sat there, before developing, swirling into a depression. Elegant rednailed
fingers her pointer, she reviewed the satellite photographs. One day the mass wheeled up, slowed,
downgraded, its eye winking closed as it came almost to a standstill and merely drifted across the
line, then reversed itself, crazily, against the clock now. The next frame saw the eye open again,
enraged and red as a polished nail, under enhancement. The passage of a short time brought arms
and a tail reaching menace far into the surrounding sea.

The manager appeared from behind his counter, holding out open hands. “Please.” A black mus-
tache fell over his lips, twitched up and down. “Just enjoy yourselves. There's no knowing where the
thing may go.”

“You know,” an older man said turning to the crowd, “thirtysome years ago this place was wiped
clean out by one of them. If they was two boards left together nobody knowed because all this was
water.”

“It will take some days before it gets even near,” the manager twitched.

“Well, maybe some folks want to get out while there’s still time.”

At her ear, the woman heard her companion mutter something about last resorts, but not quietly
enough. Many in the crowd stared at him before trouping upstairs. From the safety of his office, the
manager glared out before shutting the door.

The couple passed another afternoon in the shade of the balcony. Strand by strand, chin wrin-
kled on her chest, the woman carried out an examination for split ends. By an unbidden prompt of
sensation, the tickle of her shampoo, she suddenly inhabited a winter night haunted by dark winds,
felt on her arms the heat of his fire before which she bent and dried her hair. She was asking him
if he knew any jokes. He said only the one he was living. Dropping the final tendril with a sigh,
she clacked her glass on the table amid the little plates; the man closed his book on an index finger
and from the shade of a longbilled painter’s cap looked at her over dark glasses.

“Wouldn’t packing be a good idea?”

“May as well be here.”
