Calabash

founded, Eventually, my mother who was never short on words, touched my arms and asked,
“Are you okay?”
I nodded, still unable to speak. Then we discovered we were stuck. The passenger door where I sat was

smashed completely into the side of the rock, so that I was unable to open the door and my mother's door was

equally stuck. Discovering this, my mother suggested that we crawl through the window.

“Come climb over me and crawl out first,” my mother said, shifting herself in the tight space.
Being skinny, I scrambled out without any difficulty, although I scraped my hands and knees on the
jagged edges of the rock once I crawled out. My mother, however, had much more difficulty trudg-
ing through the window. She clambered on her seat, but could not position herself correctly to climb
through the window. I stood trembling on the rock on which I had crawled, urging my mother to
climb through. I could see her position and repositioning herself. The sun sunk completely, taking
its pink-sleepy eye with it. Night was on it way. I focused all my attention on my mother, and lean-
ing on the car, directed her exit through the window. Once she was safely out, we jumped off the
rock and surveyed the car. The evening had suddenly gone grey. My mother and I simultaneously
leaned against the rock and laughter erupted from our mouths, spilled from our throats, until we were
bent over, tears streaming down both our faces. Then just as suddenly my mother pulled me to her,
and wrapped her arms around me, my hands clutching her waist. How long we stood thus, I don’t
remember, but the darkness that seem to suddenly encircle us quieted our tremor. Grabbing hold of
my hand, my mother and I started to walk down the road, the only sounds were our shoes against
the pavement, and the dirge-like chatter of the crickets. Not a house, shed or human life was in sight.
No car passed us by as we walked the mile and a half home. Luckily it was all down hill.

My mother walked pass our house, going directly to the club where she was certain to find sev-
eral men gathered, drinking, talking, playing billiards and ping-pong. Once there, she related our
escapade; the men looked at her incredulously. Several men decided that they had to see for them-
selves the position of my mother’s car. Regretfully, I was sent home while my mother climbed into
one of the men’s jeep, and several others piled in a land-rover and both vehicles sped off through
the large wrought-iron gate heading towards the hill. My sister and Enid were my only audience,
but I took full opportunity to embellish the details, having recovered my voice and my spirit for
adventure.

It was completely dark when my mother returned, but sadly, our car that we had named Betsy
was not with her, It was too deeply wedged in the rock for the men to free, she stated. They would
have to wait until the next day to get a crane to free the car.

Several times during the night I woke up screaming, clutching the bed-spread. I kept dreaming
that I was falling, falling, falling, into an endless hole. I was only saved from falling to my death by
waking. My mother came and got me, allowing me to sleep with her. I nestled close to her body and

threw my leg over her.
