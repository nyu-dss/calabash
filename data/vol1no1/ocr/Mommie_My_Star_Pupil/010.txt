ther under my thighs and pressed my entire weight into them. My mother turned to me and asked,

“Are your ready?” still driving, but slowly as if preparing to stop. I looked at the large rocks, and
glanced down at the precipice to her left and said , “No, not here,” a little louder than I had intended.

“Okay, we'll go a little further,” my mother said, not remarking about me raising my voice at her.
We drove until the road dead-ended, then my mother turned around on the narrow road, very care-
fully, taking her time, then she stopped the car at a clearing and we came out, walked to the edge
and looked down at the view. We could see the two cities between which our community was nes-
tled. I spread wide my arms and breathed in the cool air. The sun was a streak of gold, pink and
green just beyond the valley. My mother’s face was calm and happy and in that instant I knew she
could do it.

“Let's go Mommie. You have to stop on the hill then start again before it gets dark.” I commanded,
taking her hand.

“Alright, teacher,” she replied and we hastened back to the car.

We drove by where the accident had occurred, drove down that hill, then made a right turn fur-
ther down where the road forked and took that road leading to a residential section. My mother and
I soon agreed on a spot where she stopped, this time the precipice to my right. I swallowed and
gulped for air my fingers cramped from clutching the dash-board. Very carefully, my mother moved
forward without any difficulty. I was suddenly able to breathe easily and the lump slipped down my
throat.

‘T did it!” my mother shouted as if she had doubted herself.

“Of course you did,” I said, proud at the calm and assurance in my voice. “but you need to try it
once more. And she did, three times in fact, and each time successfully without so much as rolling
back a fraction. My mother and I laughed and sang out loud all the way home, and found my sis-
ter sitting by the gate, her book at her side.

My mother and | decided she was ready to take her driving test, but when she made that
announcement Mr. Harrison and others suggested that she should wait a while. Mr. Harrison was
still having a migraine, and I remembered that his name was still under the heavy rock. The first
opportunity I got I went and pushed away the large rock and took out the almost disintegrated paper
on which I had written Mr. Harrison’s name.

Determined to go ahead and take her license, my mother sought the assistance of someone else
but strangely enough, Mr. Harrison came forward and agreed to take her. So the following Saturday
morning, Mr. Harrison picked up my mother and off they went. All morning long I paced back and
forth on the round-about that enclosed the large silk-cotton tree that was like a sentinel in front of
our house. I tossed twigs and stones at lizards. I spread my arms like the humming-bird I spied. I
picked barks from the tree. I pulled at weeds. I declined invitations by Sheryl and others to play. I

ignored Enid when she called me to come in, claiming I was going to go mad sitting all day in the
