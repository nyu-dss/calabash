Three weeks after I wrote my grandfather, my mother received a letter from him, her father with
lots of American dollars and declared she was going to have Betsy repair. 1 hugged her and we
danced around, but we still had to wait another two weeks before Betsy came home. Mr. Harrison
took my mother and I to collect Betsy, who looked just as new and shiny as before. We had a cele-
bration, and Enid helped my sister and I make crepe flowers which we used to decorate Betsy, and
my mother said since we hadn’t christened Betsy, now was as good a time as ever. So she went into
the cabinet of her buffet were she kept rum and wines for parties and special occasion, took out one
of the fruit wines she made, and carrying the wine, my mother and I leading the way, my sister and
Enid up the rear, we walked to the garage where my mother poured us all wines in her special glasses
that Enid had carried in a tray and we all raised our glasses to Betsy. Enid poured a little wine on
the ground for the ancestors, she said, but Bingo licked at it and barked when we raised our glasses
and toasted Betsy.

The first week after Betsy returned my mother and I merely drove around the community, prac-
ticing going fast and slow, reversing, turning, and driving around barrels, all of which she maneu-
vered successful. I told her she passed with flying colors. We avoided going up the hill and never
even mentioned it, but it was on both our minds. The Sunday of the following week my mother
announced that she was going out, but I could not come with her. Instantly fear seized me. I knew
she was going to go up the hill to practice and she didn’t want to take me in case something hap-
pened. As she went to the door, I grabbed her arm. “Mommie, please don’t go up the hill without
me, please Mommie, please.” | felt the tears streaming down my cheeks, and buried my face in her
clothes, My sister, hearing me came to enquire, leaning against the bed-room door, a book in her
hand. She said nothing, but when I looked at her face I knew she was about to cry too.

“It's going to be okay,” my mother said, ending in a chuckle that was not fully formed. I clutched
to her more firmly as she tried to pry me lose. Softened by my sister’s sorrowful probing stare and
my firm grasp and loud pleading, my mother finally decided I could go with her. I quickly pulled
on my shoes and walked outside to the garage with my mother whose palms were sweaty. Once
inside Betsy, she patted the steering wheel and took a few deep breaths before starting the engine.
I sat on both my hands, middle fingers of both hands crossed over index fingers. Slowly we reversed
through our gate, turned at the large lawns that fronted out house, made a left and drove down the
short road and came to a full stop at the large iron-wrought gates. My mother and I took deep
breaths as we looked at the road leading to the hill that faced us. “Mommie, you're the best driver
in the world,” I said. Then my mother placed her foot on the gas pedal, eased gently off the clutch
and we moved forward smoothly. I felt a lump in my throat and I tried to swallow. Goose-bumps
covered my arms. My eyes darted from the road ahead, to my mother’s hands and feet. I focused on
the sound of Betsy’s whirring engine. My mother began to hum and before long I joined her. We
inched close by the spot where Betsy had gotten stuck. I shoved my hands that were cramping fur-
