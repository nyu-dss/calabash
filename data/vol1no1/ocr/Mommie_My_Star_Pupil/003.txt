I heaped my fork and swallowed mouthfuls of minced-meat, spaghetti, rice, tomatoes and shred-
ded carrot, determined not to be left behind. Finally we pushed back our chairs, excused from the
table. I darted outside, heading for the garage, in my flight calling to Enid who was clearing the table,

“You want to come for a drive?” I did not hear her reply. I stood anxiously by the car, waiting for
my mother and sister, engaged in conversation, as they walked towards me standing by the car.
‘Hurry up! Hurry-up!’ I shouted in my head, hopping from one leg to the next. Finally my mother
was by the car, the shiny silver keys jingling in her hand. She opened the doors, and I raced around
to get in the front, but my mother said, since my sister was older, she got to sit up front. Normally,
[ would have complained about the unfairness of my sister always getting first because she was older,
but I was so excited, I merely slipped in the seat behind my mother.

Before my mother started the car, she turned to my sister and I and said, “We're only going to the
church because I don’t have any Ls yet.”

My mother did not have her driver’s license, in fact she didn’t even have her learner's permit, or
the large red, “L” letters that were to be affixed to the fender and bumper of a car to warn other
motorists that the person driving was not yet a real driver. My mother took a long time backing out
the garage, having difficulty locating the reverse gear, then she made several awkward jerks, chang-
ing gears. I encouraged her to drive faster, and suggested that she pushed the gear stick, gently but
firmly the way I had observed my father and other men do. I mean, what could be so difficult, it was
like a cane held stiffly in packed-mud. My mother followed my suggestion and my sister and I had
our drive to the church, about half mile from our house, and which was the point of intersection,
leading to three more miles of road that was trafficked by many cars and trucks.

The next afternoon, Harrison, a man in our small insular community who taught people to drive,
came over and showed my mother how to change gears smoothly. But he merely echoed my advice
and when he sat in the driver’s seat to demonstrate to my mother, I sat forward in the middle of the
back seat, peering between the driver and passenger seat up front, and kept saying, “See MOMMIE!
See, didn’t I tell you,” until she told me to be quiet. A few days later, my mother got her “Ls” and
affixed them to the car. From then on, every evening, my mother and I went practicing. I was very
happy that my sister did not accompany us as she had lots of home-work, studying for the com-
mon entrance, although she was only going to be nine years old in June.

My mother resolved to teach herself to drive on her own and I decided I would coach her. Once
we agreed on our plan, we established a practice schedule. Every evening my mother and I ventured
further with my coaching. After a week we drove to the main road, leading to Kingston in one direc-
tion, and Spanish Town in the other, and not once did the gear scrape or the car seem to jerk and
cough when my mother changed gear. Still, my mother decided that she should stop at the main road,
and turn back into our community. I concurred with her wise decision after we parked for a while by

the main road, an endless stream of cars, trucks and buses zooming by like a run-away-train.
