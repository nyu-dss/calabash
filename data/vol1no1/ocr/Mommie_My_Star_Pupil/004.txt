The fact that we now had a car, a shiny blue Anglia, caused different people in the community to
speculate. All of a sudden, people who weren’t in the habit of stopping by would drop by just about
the time when my mother returned from work.

“Mrs. Plumber,” smacked Miss McFarlane, the spinster who lived and kept house for her father,
“You're prosperous. Dat’s a good looking car you have there.”

My mother smiled agreement, but no words passed her lips. I wanted to tell that Miss McFarlane
to go and smack somewhere else. She always seemed to have something in her mouth that she
smacked on. Mrs. Reed, the plump pastor's wife whom everyone called roll-poly behind her back,
was more straightforward. “Mrs. Plumber how you can afford such a car?”

“I understand that’s the question of the day,” my mother said laughing, in her customary manner
to dismiss most things. “Well all people need to know is that I didn’t steal it and I didn’t lay down
to get it either.”

Mrs, Reed giggled nervously and I wondered what my mother meant that she didn’t lie down to
get it. How does one lay down to get a car I pondered, but not for too long because my mother
excused herself saying our dinner was getting cold, and then she had to practice her driving before
it got dark.

After several weeks of practicing driving on the straight narrow road, stopping and starting with-
out stalling, signaling to turn left or right, reversing to talk to a friend by their gate without swerv-
ing in a zig-zag manner, | told my mother I thought we were ready for the next level, driving
through and around several barrels. So she had the gardener place three barrels strategically on the
huge lawn in front of our house, and we began the next phase. Several times my mother knocked
one or more of the barrels down when reversing. Often, I would stand outside, holding up my hand
to indicate to her when she needed to stop or gesturing when she needed to turn more one way or
the other. Sometimes my mother was so confused that my signals were of little help. At those times
she would leave the engine running while she stepped from the car to better gage the distance. This
was another occasion for some of the men, in the community, including several with wives, to gather
and offer their service to teach my mother who always smiled but declined.

“Sonia,” Mr. Griffith whom we called drum-stick as his legs were embarrassingly skinny, as if he
was malnourished my mother said, was on a first name basis with my mother, and who often took
it upon himself to visit us around dinner time and invite himself to join us, wet his lips as he stood
watching my mother maneuver the barrel. “Sonia, why you so independent. Mek me teach you, nuh,
No charge, consider it a neighborly gesture.” He ended holding on to the driver's door as my mother
took a break.

“Mommie,” I squealed, “You really driving well ,” and I jumped in the passenger seat and stared
boldly at Mr. Griffith smiling into my mother’s face.

In record time, my mother mastered this phase with only four small scratches on our shinny sea-
