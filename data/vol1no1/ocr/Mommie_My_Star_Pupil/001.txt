FTER MY MOTHER AND FATHER SEPARATED my sister and I moved with my mother to
A a small sugar estate that was about four miles from any major road. There was no public bus
so we were dependent on friends. However, because of my mother’s position as executive secretary
and social manager, we often had access to one of the estate’s vehicles and drivers.

We had a detached garage, but for many years after moving to the estate it was home to several
boxes, endless cob-webs and many lizards. It also served as playground, the perfect hide-n-seek-spot,

I tried opening the doors of the car, but they were locked. My sister, being older, felt accountable
for my behavior so cautioned me.

“You better leave de doors; you don’t know is whose car. IF you mash it up, you go get in trouble.”

I stuck out my tongue at her, but allowed my hands to fall to my side. Then it occurred to me
that I could find out what I wanted to know by going in the house and asking my mother, assum-

“You better take up your bag and lunch-box,” she said, sauntering ahead of me. In that moment
