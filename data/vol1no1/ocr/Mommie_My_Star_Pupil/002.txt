quently knocking over those in my path. I ran back, picked up my things and raced my way into
the house, without shoving my sister out of the way.

“Is who car, Enid?” I turned to our maid, breathing through half-opened mouth.

“Aftanoon Miss Patsy,” Enid said, reaching to take my lunch box. I wanted to shout at her, but
knew I would get no where.

“Yuh moda not learnin yuh no manners,” she said, looking me squarely in the face.

“Good afternoon, Enid,” I said, trying to keep the irritation out of my voice. “Is whose car?”

“Aftanoon, Pasty. Please to wash yuh hand an come ave yuh snack.” Enid was exasperating. I
flounced out the kitchen, chucked one of the chairs as I passed through the pantry-breakfast-nook,
tossed my bag on my bed, then went to the bathroom and washed my hands. However, I decided,
just to spite Enid for her meanness, I wasn’t going to sit and have my snack. I took off my school
uniform, put on a shorts and top, grabbed my snack and ran outside. I shouted for my friend Sheryl
at the fence which separated her backyard from mine. I bellowed several times before the woman
who worked for Sheryl’s family called back,

“She not home yet.”

I felt as if everyone was conspiring against me. Bingo, the oldest of our five dogs, sallied up to
me and rubbed against my feet. I ruffled his fur between his ears as he liked and together we walked
back to the garage. A bread-fruit tree where Bingo and I often sat when I was mad or needed time
to think, partially sheltered the garage. As I walked under it, a leaf sailed down before me. I stretched
out my hand and caught it. At the garage door, we both stood, Bingo breathing excitedly through
his open mouth, tongue extended, me longing to go for a drive. I closed my eyes tight, lapped my
middle finger over my index finger and smiled at the sound of the engine starting. However, I was
yanked from my reverie when Enid’s rankling voice, sour like tamarind, called me.

“Patsy, come duh yuh homework; yuh know yuh moda seh fi duh yuh school work fore yuh play.”
Sometimes I dreamed that Enid was steam that vanished after it evaporated. At that very moment ,
I wished I were a magician.

After an eternity of time, and not being able to figure out my long-division, my sister refusing to
help me, and Enid telling me that she didn’t get that far in school and that I should try harder, my
mother finally returned from work. I scattered my books getting up, sallied to my mother, kissed her
then blurred out,

“MOMMIE! MOMMIE! Is our car in de garage?” She smiled and nodded her head. I jumped up
and down, clapping my hands.

“Can we go for a ride, MOMMIE?” | implored.

“Can we please, MOMMIE?” my normally cucumber-mannered sister joined turning into corn
popping.

“After dinner, now go wash up,” My mother said, turning into her bed-room.
