ving, my mother decided it was time to practice stopping at a certain point, then proceeding forward
without stalling. This proved more difficult than both of us had anticipated, and it took several tries,
but my mother was determined to master this last task as she was planning to take her driving test
in three weeks. We spent longer time practicing, me always in the front with my mother, offering
advice, making suggestions, and feeling proud to be a car owner.

One evening, with only two weeks to go, my mother came home late from a meeting. I was dis-
appointed as I had grown accustomed to her daily practice.

“Mommie, you not gwane practice?” | asked hopeful.

She paused for a moment, as if deciding. As I was bent on us having our daily practice, I decided
to influence my mother’s decision.

“Is only two weeks left, Mommie, and you really need to practice reversing widout rollin back.”

“You're right,” she said. “Go get de keys, let’s go,” my mother announced, walking to the kitchen
to get some juice.

I got the keys, rushed outside, opened the car doors and waited for my mother. We drove up the
hill slowly, and at the point where the road forked at the top, rather than going right, my mother
decided to take the road leading to the golf-course, a route we had never taken before.

All was desolation, huge boulders to my right, deep precipice to my mother’s left. We drove in
silence, my mother clutching the steering wheel, me sitting forward in my seat to see ahead. The sun
was sinking, and the air felt cool through the window. I was thinking about how I was going to buy
my own car, just like my mother, when I was grown, so I didn’t hear my mother the first time she
spoke to me,

“You think this is a good place to stop?” she repeated.

“Yes,” I replied confidently.

My mother stopped the car in the middle of the road. I kneeled on the seat, looking all around.
The huge rocks didn’t worry me, but the great cliffs to my mother’s left, caused me to hold my
breath. I sat back in my seat and watched my mother maneuver the car, one foot on the breaks, the
other on the clutch, she glanced behind to make sure no car was coming, Then she attempted to put
the car in first gear to move forward, but somehow the gear was stuck as if held by cement. My
mother’s foot eased off the breaks and immediately the car started to roll back. I glanced behind me
and was convinced the car was going to roll over the banking.

“Mommie! Mommie!” I shouted still staring behind. “We go roll down de hill.” I felt like fat red
ants were biting me all over. My mother turned the steering wheel in the opposite direction, still unable
to find first gear; she applied the breaks, pressing and pumping the pedal, but the car kept rolling,
“Turn the other way mommie, turn!” | screamed, my heart pushing hard against my chest. I held on
tightly to my seat as we kept rolling, now heading towards the boulder. Finally, with a great thud the
car landed in a crevice. For well over five minutes, or at least so it seemed, my mother and I sat dumb-
