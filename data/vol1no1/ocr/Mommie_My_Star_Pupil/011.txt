hot sun. I could not be budged. I kept a constant prayer going inside my head ‘Please make mom-
mie pass her driving test; please make mommie pass her driving test.’ I kept both my middle fingers
crossed over my index fingers; I even tried with my toes. Nothing could entice me away from my
vigilance. ‘If only mommie had taken me with her, I could tell her when she was too close,’ I kept
thinking, trying to imagine her every move.

I must have dozed, because I came promptly awake by the blowing of a horn, and when I got
my bearing there was my mother waving to me; she was driving shinny deep-blue Betsy, all alone.
Could it be what I suspected? Was I dreaming? I ran over to my mother whose face was all smiles.
Her eyes twinkled.

“I passed!” she shouted, laughter spilling from her. I hugged her through the window and jumped
for joy. She said I should go inside and get my sister and Enid so she could take us all for a drive. I
skipped towards the house, my voice racing ahead of me:

“Mommie pass! Mommie pass her driving exam.” I blared over and over, even after I was inside
the house. “Come, she go take us for a ride,” I said rushing back out.

I dashed to the car, beautiful Betsy, way ahead of my sister and Enid. My mother said I could ride
up front since I helped her pass the driving test. I felt like she had given me a basket full of par-
adise-plums as I held back the front seat for my sister and Enid to enter.

“Le we go,” I said as my mother pulled off smoothly. She drove confidently, blaring the horn and
waving to everyone we saw. I was so proud of her.
