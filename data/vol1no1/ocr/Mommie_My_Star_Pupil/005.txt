blue Anglia. She was finally ready for the last stage of her practice: driving up hill, stopping, then
proceeding without the car jerking or rolling back. Several men had failed their driving test the first
time because of this task, but my mother was determined to pass the first time. Again the men came
with their advice to which my mother and I listened to politely.

“You know Mrs. Plumber,” said one, “an experienced driver like me could teach you a thing or
two to make sure you pass de test.”

“Driving is not only mastering de skills,” offered another, “You're state of mind is just as important.”

“Why you think there are so few women drivers?”

“Why?” I blurted since my mother didn’t seem curious.

“Because,” our pot-bellied neighbor continued not even scolding me for interfering in big-people
conversation, “Because woman easy loose dem head cause accident,” he declared self-righteously.

“It appears too that many men loose their heads, since weekly men are involved in accidents,” my
mother said, pulling my hand and turning into our gate. Once she closed the gate behind us, she
scolded me, “Missy,” she began in a tone that told be I had out-stepped my boundaries, “I don’t want
to have to remind you to watch your mouth and not put in your pence worth in adult conversation.”

“Yes, mommie,” I mumbled, my lips pouting.

My mother and I continued our driving lesson and it was the talk all over the community. Daily
the other children would quiz me on the school-bus about our car, and how much we paid for it,
and where my mother got the money, and where was my father, and why did my mother feel she
have to learn to drive anyway since all their mothers were driven wherever they needed to go by
their fathers, or had to take the bus. However, one evening a visitor offered my mother praise instead.
As I sat, pretending to be engrossed in studying my spelling words, a neighbor, whose husband had
gotten two of their maids pregnant, or at least so the gossiped was rumored, came over after my
mother and I had returned from practicing and whispered to my mother how lucky she was not hav-
ing a husband, and how brave she was to buy a car with her own money and be teaching herself to
drive, when so very few women drove. On the entire estate, only two other women drove, one, the
owner's wife, and the other, the horse-trainer, but they didn’t count as they were English and often
went about in unwomanly ways, as far as the community was concerned, inappropriate for any
respectable lady, which is what my mother was, even though she was divorced. Our neighbors’ vis-
its emboldened my mother's determination and I became a more exacting teacher.

My mother and I began to venture up the hill where the owner and a few other English families,
the husbands occupying important positions in the running of the estate, lived, Similar to our other
ventures, we started out doing the basic, merely driving up the hill, finding a wide space to turn
around, then driving down slowly on the road which ran straight into the big wrought-iron gate
beyond which was our house and two others, as well as the elegant club of the estate that was

reserved for the executive staff, of which we were members. After about a week of this routine dri-
