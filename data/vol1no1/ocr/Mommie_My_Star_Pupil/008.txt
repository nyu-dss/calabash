All the next day in school my mind worried about Betsy, our car. Consequently, I was scolded by
the teacher and even received two slaps with the ruler, one in each palm, for not paying attention.
When I arrived home that afternoon and saw Betsy, tears rolled down my cheeks, The passenger
door, where I had been sitting, was crashed in and streaked with the white filament of the rock; the
rear fender was hanging and the entire car looked as if it had been put through the machines which
crushed the canes, sapping the juice. Such an ordeal! When Enid called me to come in for my snack,
I refused, insisting on sitting outside under the bread-fruit tree, mourning my loss.

Imagine then my surprise when my mother returned from work, smiling. She told Enid how Mr.
McLeish, her boss, said they should give her the license as he has never seen anyone park so per-
fectly in such a tight space. I did not see the joke. My mother said it took several men over three
hours, chipping away at sections of the rock to free Betsy; poor, poor Betsy. Later, several men came
over, offering to give my mother lessons. She thanked them graciously, but declined their offer, say-
ing she thought she could manage on her own. I reminded her that she needed my help, and
together we would master stopping on a hill, then preceding forward without rolling back, but say-
ing so, a great lump rose in my throat, and I did not speak with too much conviction.

Betsy was towed away for repairs, and once again our garage stood empty, except for Bingo and I
who daily sat in there for long periods. To heighten my sadness my mother decided to continue with
her lesson, but since she no longer had a car, had to resort to taking lesson with Mr. Harrison who
did not allow passengers with his trainees. I stomped my feet, I pouted, I refused to eat dinner. I
wished that Mr. Harrison would break his leg. But nothing happened and for three long everlasting
evenings my mother went practicing her driving without me. I would not be outdone. I called down
disaster on Mr. Harrison and wrote his name on a piece of paper and put it under a heavy rock. The
following Monday as my mother sat waiting for Mr. Harrison on the veranda with me leaning on her,
begging her to take me, his son came and said, Harrison, his father, had a migraine headache and
would not be able to give her lessons. A smile broke over my face, but I made my voice say how sorry
I was. Somehow Mr. Harrison was unable to come and take my mother practicing all that week, and
with my suggestion my mother decided her original plan was best, to teach herself to drive with my
help. The only problem was, we had no car, and when I asked my mother when we would get Betsy
back, she said it would cost too much to repair and she could not afford it right now. I didn’t know
what to do or who to turn to, but when I received a letter with a $5 bill from my grandfather who
was living in America, I decided straight way to write him and tell him what happened. My mother
was very pleased that I was so willing to write my grandfather, and took the letter with her the next
day to post. Daily I waited for a reply but none came. Every evening various men from the commu-
nity visited our home, sat on the veranda drinking large glasses of my mother’s delicious fruit juice
concoction while offering her their service to teach her to drive. I always made it a point to be close

by the veranda where I was seen, but not heard, and therefore heard all they said.
