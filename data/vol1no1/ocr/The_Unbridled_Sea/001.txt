OREIGN BUT FAMILIAR, NEW YET LOADED WITH OLD MYTHS, Ms. McCallum’s
lake burst into your mind and don’t let go. They make you see, they make you hear, they thrust
you into Calypso land and they make you dance.

This is the first thing a reader would experience, the Caribbean rhythm; the conscious awareness
