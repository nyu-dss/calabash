come to terms with their differences, with their many skins.

McCallum accomplishes this manifold structure through the use of fairytales and folktales, both
from the European and the Afro-Caribbean traditions. The figure of Anancy the spider, the most
famous trickster — whose story originated in West Aftica and was brought to the Caribbean and
South America by the slaves — is behind all evil, all desertions. In a way it is a comforting self-decep-
tion to think of Anancy as the sole cause for Rapunzel’s destiny, “then it is not / the mother / the
father”, but “it is anancy / who started it” (jack mondoora me no choose none). Hansel and Gretel, Snow
White, Cinderella, all of them abandoned and deserted, and the cause “if is not anancy is who?”

Many are the recurrent themes that are revealed through the use of tales, At the core of
McCallum’s experiments there is always the tearful separation of a child from her mother, or the
inexplicable desertion by her father. This idea of abandonment and displacement is brought to the
fore by the figure of Heidi, the little shepherdess who is forced to leave her beloved grandfather, her
land, her heaven. Like Heidi, upon coming back home the narrator will find “No note, no / expla-
nation. The gate swinging / on its hinges” (8 Hope Road). The same desolation of “the house / of
broken windows, / thorn-covered walls, / the empty porch swing / creaking in the wind” awaits
the return of the narrator and her sisters in Poem Where My Mother and Father are Absent. The return is
never to a happy home: most often it is to a “house / weathering: paint / chipping in places, / shin-
gles loose, / shutters disheveled- / hanging at odd angles / like broken limbs.” (The Evolution of
Useful Things)

Mothers are seldom there to console or sooth, and the binding water of the womb becomes
instead the river of separation. Fathers are like Gods, distant and unable to show compassion while
sitting in the garden of Eden “eating the white meat / with the serpent” (Appld).

Her method and style may be defined as “magic realism”, linking her work to those of such Latin
American authors as José Luis Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marquez, or — especially in the rewriting of
fairy tales into nightmares — to that of Angela Carter. Realistic images are superimposed by the inde-
scribable mystery of ghastly figures and supernatural elements drawn from a child’s fears and dreams.

McCallum makes also good use of the postmodernist idea of intertextuality. Echoes of other
poets and artists are distant yet present in her poems, becoming integral part of her story, blending
into a Caribbean calabash.

[One example that comes quickly to mind is the hag with a “soured breath,” feasting all night on
the narrator’s flesh in McCallum’s The Spell, which vaguely recalls Sylvia Plath’s Lady Lazarus with
her “sour breath.” And Plath is again sensed in Darkling I listen, though here there’s more compas-

The water of the book's title is both life-giving and life-taking. Images of birth and of drown-
ing intermix throughout the narrative, and lead to the final section of the book which is devoted to
