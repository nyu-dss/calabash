“the sirens.” Once again the realistic images, the mythological figures and a child’s nightmare come
together on the page. The turmoil of conflicting emotions — the feeling of guilt on the one hand
and defiance on the other, felt by the sirens, the abandoned children of our story — all at once, unex-
pectedly and powerfully, hits the astonished reader, who is now made to feel it too.

The journey is over, sides are taken, belonging can be a tearing choice. There will be no return
once the siren has chosen to lose her scales and “cast off her flesh” (The tragedy of the mermaid). There
will be no redemption. The price will be a lifetime spent “chipping away layers / of flesh” (What the
Oracle Said) and the only words echoing in her ears will be the Oracle’s prophecy: “The sea will never
take you back”. ew
