An Exercise In Discipline

SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THE LINE UP INTHE FIRST PLACE. I was only five. It's just
I that when I saw my brother, two years older, but two inches shorter, standing in that long queue
and looking apprehensive, I felt I just had to join in. It was Tuesday morning, and a reluctant line of
school children were shuffling a slow, sad path to the girls’ bathroom, or , as my knowledgeable
class-mates informed me, “De Girls’ Lavatory”, to be flogged. What had we done to deserve this? I
don’t know about the others, but my brother and I had been absent from school on Monday, and
we had not brought in a written excuse. The headmistress was very particular about breaches of the
school rules such as these.

I was breathing fast. 1 had never been flogged by the headmistress before, but I had heard many
awesome tales about the strap. It was black, it was brown, it had stripes, it had dots, and, when it moved
through the air, it would whistle. I started rubbing my hands up and down the sides of my navy blue
tunic. You see, having joined the line because I felt if he was going to be punished, I should be as well,
having committed the same crime, I was now having serious doubts about this thing. Actually the real
reason of my fear was that I was about to be flogged and I had not had time to prepare.

The preparation was one of the school’s best kept secrets, From the eldest pupil to the youngest
knew that a strategically placed exercise book would significantly lessen the effect of a heavy strap
on a juvenile behind. This procedure was far more successful with the boys in their, in most cases,
tight khaki pants. The girls, who had to wear huge puff-legged bloomers to match their tunics, had
to be careful in case the exercise book shifted elsewhere in the voluminous folds, thus defeating the
whole purpose of the exercise.

We were there, the line had fused into a huddle in the confines of the “girls’ lavatory”, with its
dreary yellow walls, cold concrete floor and variety of smells doing battle with Jeyes Fluid. The
headmistress, Miss Barrett, was already in position near the pipes, waiting for us. “A woman's got to
do what a woman’s got to do,” is what she said.

The ritual was the same. One of the sentenced would emerge from the knot and face the judge.
The judge was prepared. “And what did you do?” she would drone. The order was always the same.
Silence. Then the strap, as predicted by the veterans of this procedure, would whistle through the
air and find its quarry. The number of stripes depended on the severity of the crime.
