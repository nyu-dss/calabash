Calabash

The practiced eyes and ears of the prisoners who had not yet received their sentence could tell who
and who had not had time to sneak in an exercise book. There where two clues: one, the particular
sound of the thwack when it landed, and two, the degree of pain on the face of the freshly chastised.

“And what did you do?”

“Mumble, mumble.”

“Turn round and bend down.”

THWACK. Dismissed.

“And what did you do?”

“Mumble, mumble, mumble.”

“Turn round and bend down.”

THWACK, THWACK.

It was the “THWACK, THWACK, THWACKS” you really felt sorry for.

The headmistress was carrying on a brisk trade on that particular morning. Our confessions in
exchange for her “THWACKS”. The gang diminished, soon it would be my turn, but just then, a
short stocky boy named Antny crept forward. I gasped. Antny, in his natural state, already had a pre-
padded look, and the older boys took delight in landing swift kicks on his round behind. I had wit-
nessed this myself at break and at lunch. But today something was wrong. We who remained in the
diminished group nudged each other and whispered frantically as we caught sight of Antny’s altered
rear end. What on earth did he think he was doing? He stood there face to face with the cleanser
of sins, and she could not see what was obvious to our amazed eyes. Antny’s round derriere was
square. Our whispers grew more urgent. “Quiet, please,” barked Miss Maycock. Miss Maycock was
second in command to Miss Barrett, in case the chief's iron arm gave out. The whispers ceased, but
the nudging went on. How could we suppress our emotion when our secret, our only defense against
Miss Barrett's strap was about to be exposed? We were barely drawing enough breath to remain
conscious. We could feel our hearts beating. I, for one, could actually hear mine: THUMP, THUMP,
THUMP, THUMP, THUMP, THUMP.

Barrett: “And what did you do?”

Antny: “Mumble, mumble, mumble.

Mumble, mumble, mumble.

Mumble, mumble, mumble.

Barrett: “Turn round and bend down.”

Prisoners: “Ahhhh!”

Antny turned around and bent down, and peeping out through the frayed khaki cloth of Antny’s
school pants was a picture of the Queen of England. Miss Barrett's arm stopped mid-strike. She
went into shock. The, arm sill raised, she bent over, left fingers spread wide, and pushed firmly

against Antny’s short pants.
