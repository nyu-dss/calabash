She then did something unprecedented in the history of the school. Miss Barrett hooked her fore-
finger in the elastic waist band of the khaki pants and pulled, peered inside, and bent down to get
a better view. We stood as still as statues and breathed as one.

Without relinquishing her hold on the elastic, Miss Barrett reared up, back ramrod straight. The
pressure on Antny’s crotch must have been unbearable. “Miss Maycock, come over here”. Miss
Maycock came. “Please pull out these exercise books”. Miss Maycock pulled. Antny had stuffed in
seven. All blue, with pictures of Her Majesty on the front and the times tables on the back. Single
lined and double lined, squared, old, new, but all warm and squashed were hauled out to the light
of day and tossed on the concrete floor. SMACK, SMACK, SMACK, SMACK, SMACK,
SMACK,SMACK.

You would have to have been made of cast iron not to feel sorry for Antny that day, even though,
by this back-up venture he had effectively spoilt things for the whole school. Antny not only had
on a frayed khaki pants but he, like a lot of other school boys, was not wearing under pants. What?
Shirt, pants, shoes, socks and under pants too? Many mothers could supply only the bare necessi-
ties. Some children did not even have school socks.

We witnessed another unprecedented event. Miss Barrett’s arm actually grew tired with the
amount of THWACKS she laid on Antny’s bottom that day. I believe he would have preferred a life
sentence, But that was not all. She stood there massaging her right shoulder, her eyes locked with
Miss Maycock’s eyes, and then simultaneously her optic organs fastened on us, the accused.

No words were needed. They moved as one towards the prisoners left in the dock, as we stepped
backwards slowly and pressed our bodies against the cold yellow walls.

The avenging angels drew closer. Miss Barrett stuck to her tried and tested formula. “Turn round
and bend down,” she thundered. We obeyed.

Bottoms presented we waited while our elasticized bands were pulled and a thorough search ensued,
Out came more blue exercise books with Queen Elizabeth on the front and “Thirty Days Hath
September” on the back. They were tossed away contemptuously, and landed in various undignified posi-
tions on the concrete floor SMACK, SMACK, SMACK and then THWACK,THWACK, THWACK.
Thank goodness I had not had time to prepare because all the padded behinds got an extra dose.

A new tule was added to the already weighty list and read to us at prayers the next morning, “All
pupils will be searched before being flogged. Any exercise books, or any other padding, found in
school uniforms will be confiscated, and the punishment will be doubled.”

Antny made himself scarce at break and lunch for weeks to come because the whole school knew
who was responsible for this new rule. After the last encounter with the strap, which broke his ten-
der skin, he was in no condition to be exposed to the bigger boys’ shoe leather.
