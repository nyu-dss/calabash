Calabash

in her hand, looking for children to break any one of the countless rules at the school. She was thin
and hard, wore her hair in a dozen short graying plaits like horns, and seemed to sense whenever
you were doing wrong. Just as you started scribbling with your pencil on the desk or the wall or
were preparing to jump from the step in the yard, you saw her small, hard eyes appear.

“Look! Miss Rose ent want none o’ that in here,” she snarled, bending over and shaking the imple-
ment in your face as if it was all she could do to keep from smashing it over your head.

She was a fearsome woman, barefoot, bottom jaw jutting out and her teeth long and brown and
slanted outward like a dilapidated fence. She put me in mind of Sharky, the squat ill-tempered mutt
at the top of Windmill Road whose bottom jaw protruded, too, like a crooked drawer, and who ran
at you, head lowered, teeth bared, snapping and snarling at your heels when you passed.

Miss Rose, though, was even more fearsome, for it was she who wielded and used the thick black
strap. She kept it closeby, coiled snakelike around her hand or draped over her shoulder or the back
of her chair, ominous, disconcerting, and all too often I felt its bite.

“Come here, Trevor,” she would snap. “Come and stand up here.”

She sat facing the class, tall, knees crossed, in a tall, straight mahogany chair. She held my exer-
cise book folded open on her lap. I went and stood in front of her, not wanting to get too close.

“Not there. Here. Come here. Come and stand up right here.”

I stood at her elbow, where I could read what she had scribbled in red ink on the page. She had
a firm writing hand, and each stroke she made with the pen made a hard scratching sound. It was
as if the page were my tender flesh and every time she wrote it I bled. As she went over my work
she kept her head down, working her jaws silently like a cow its cud. I couldn't help but notice how
both her jaws and her temples throbbed.

“Look here, Trevor. Look at this.” She had a piercing voice. “Show me how you work out this sum.”

Her hair was black and straight, with strands of gray, pinned into a bun. Seated, she seemed to
tower over me. She spoke to me in dialect, condescending, as if standard English was a language
boys from the village couldn’t understand.

“Is what I does tell your mother all the time. Know what I does tell her, Trevor? Does tell her ya
wouldn't take ya time and do ya work. Does tell her ya would be a good student, ‘cause I know you
is as bright boy, bright as anybody else at this school. But ya wouldn’t take ya time and do ya work.
Careless. Always in too much of a hurry. Ya never hear that hurry-hurry never done, Trevor? Nobody
never tell ya that?”

Her glasses sat on the tip of her nose and she looked over them at me, all the while deliberately
uncoiling the strap. It was all I saw now, thick and heavy and black. I no longer saw the book, no longer
saw her pulsing temples and jaws. Lengthening in her hand, the strap was a growing, burgeoning thing.
With her free hand she reached out, took my elbow and positioned me where she wanted me in front

of her, one step back and a little to her left, as if on the floor was an X that only she could see.
