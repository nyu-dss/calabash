My eyes and mind wandered from the garage, down the bright gravel driveway to the street where
the occasional vehicle passed. What was the use? Maybe Frupse was right. Maybe school wasn't
going to learn me anything.

So I looked forward to the end of the day.

My mother had sent me to Little Roses not just because she trusted Miss Rose's ability but also
because of the kind of children who went to private school. Before this I attended to St. Luke’s
Primary in Foster Village, where Miss Rose was headmistress, but when she retired to open her own
school my mother didn’t hesitate to send me there. It was my opportunity to rub shoulders with the
island’s great-kind.

I made friends with a boy named Sterling Branford, whose father was a doctor. The only doctor
I knew — or knew of — was Dr. Edgehill, who lived behind the wall in Windmill Road. I had never
seen him. Being rich and white he was not the type to frequent the village. You didn’t see him at the
rumshop or the standpipe or Miss Waterman’s shop, or strolling through the village's gaps, and when
you climbed up onto the wall you saw his house in the distance, sometimes his dark-green Rover
beside it, maybe his two Alsatian dogs, but not him. Even though my mother said he delivered my
brother and me, people in Foster Village weren't his regular patients; when we needed a doctor we
went to the free clinic in Bridgetown.

Sterling was always talking about his Dad — my Dad this, my Dad did that — as if it were the
most normal thing to have a father around. The only boy I knew in Windmill Road whose father
was around and lived in the same house as him was Dexter. Few boys in the gap had a father they
could claim as theirs, who was there for them other than on the odd occasion, and there were houses
with mothers and children but where I never saw a man enter or exit once. For me my father didn’t
exist, was nothing but a faded picture on the cabinet. Frupse didn’t have a father, either. His father
who was Dear Aunt’s brother had lived in America for many years, since Frupse was small, didn’t
come to Barbados, didn’t call, and didn’t write except to send a card at Christmas with five dollars
in it for Frupse. Winston’s father lived in Barbados, right in Foster Village, in Cottage Road, but never
came to see his son. Only when he happened through the gap on his bicycle and Winston was sit-
ting or standing in the road did he stop to acknowledge his existence, tapping him on the head like
a dog pausing for a second to acknowledge its young, reaching into his pocket to give him a cent
or a penny or a quarter before getting on his bicycle again and riding off.

With Sterling I felt different and inferior. He and I played a game after school in which I was ever
comparing myself to him. One of the rules at the school was that you weren't allowed to play at
the bottom of the driveway where cars entering couldn’t see you behind the tall gray walls. The
