A woman joked, “Where ya want we to size down and go, Sobers? We pack in here like sardines
a'teady, Want we to size down and go out the other side o’ the bus?”

I knew her. Her name was Muriel. She got a chuckle from the swollen bus.

When Sobers was satisfied that no one else would fit, that every hole was plugged like a leaky
roof, he stepped onto the running board and called to the driver, “Move!”

I was happy. I stepped back to make myself invisible against the wall, to be lost amid the hand-
ful of stragglers left on the sidewalk. But Muriel noticed me.

“Wait!” she called. “Don’t move yet, Headley! Don’t go nowhere yet. Let this lil boy here get on.
Can't just leave he there and let he get to school late. Must find room for he. Come, lil boy. Come
and try and squeeze in here.”

I went. I had to. All eyes were turned my way.

The conductor helped me up, and hands reached out and pulled me in.

“Come, lil boy,” said Muriel. “Squeeze in here. My lady, go ‘round a lil bit and give the lil boy a
scotch.”

She did, and I scotched in, sitting on the edge of the seat between the two women’s hips. I put
my bag on the floor and sat forward, my hands on the seat in front.

“Move!” Sobers called again, and the bus started down the hill.

Headley was my favorite bus driver. When Gregory and I played Bus on the shedroof window I
always pretended to be him. He was tall and dark and thin. Under his collar he wore a white ker-
chief, his cap was pulled down and tilted to a side, and he was ever chewing on a stalk of grass. He
sat upright in the seat, right hand on the steering wheel, left hand on the knob at the end of the
long, bent gearstick that slanted up from the floor. I liked to watch him drive, liked to watch the way
he manipulated the stubborn gears, the bus whining and lurching and whimpering like a hard-ears
child. On afternoons, whenever I could, when the bus was empty, I sat in the conductor's seat across
from him, watching him, his eyes straight, chewing on the grass, tugging and shoving at the gears.
He seemed so important and necessary, and at the same time he was courteous too. On afternoons
he drove the additional forty yards past the bus stop on the Cross Road to put people off at the
Junction, saving them the walk, and if you were late on mornings and he saw you coming, he
stopped the bus and waited for you. He looked at once so contented and important behind the wheel
of a bus, as if it were the most enviable thing. So I copied him. And for a time I wanted to be a bus
driver, too.

The bus gathered speed down the hill — a clattering of wood and metal and loose bolts. At the
stop near the bottom we passed people, slowed and turned right, and passed people at another stop.
On the straight road we picked up speed again, bumping and rattling along. On the running board
Sobers, the conductor, was a monkey on bars, swinging from pole to pole, collecting money, clip-
ping and giving tickets, making change. At each row he wrapped his elbow around the pole, the
