“Look at all these mistakes, Trevor.” I looked, feeling the tears rushing to my eyes. “You think this
is what ya mother does send you to school for? You think it’s why she paying to send you here?
When you going to start to take your time and do your work properly? How many times I going to
have to lick you to make you learn?”

I shook in my shoes. The strap went up and I flinched. With every lash I dug my fingers into my
back, wriggling, trying to remove the fiery fangs from my flesh, as the class watched and the tears
gushed from my eyes.

Mr. Forde, who taught out in the garage, had a different approach to teaching, one that was less
painful but disagreeable just the same. It made me feel no better about school. He was old and bald,
shoulders hunched with age. Thick black hair sprouted from his nostrils and ears, and his eyebrows
were thick and black. In the hot garage he wore suits, bow ties, and in his shirt pocket he carried a
pipe. At lunch and occasionally after school he sat alone in the garage and smoked his pipe.

He read to us from The Treasury of English Poetry:

The Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

He read it with relish, as if it were an edible thing. But to me it made no sense.

The sun beat down on the galvanized roof, relieved now and then by a cooling breeze that came
through the open doors like a fleeting visitor and was gone. Mr. Forde took off his jacket and lay it
on his desk. He wore a light-blue short-sleeve shirt, the underarms stained with sweat. The hair on
his arms was thick and gray. He took a blue kerchief from his trousers pocket, wiped his brow,
glanced at the ‘kerchief, put it back. He cradled the thick red book as if it were an open box of
chocolates in his hands.

“Repeat after me:

The Cur / few tolls / the knell / of par / ting day...

We repeated, like parrots.

The low / ing herd / wind slow / ly o'er / the lea. . .

It might have been a foreign tongue. No one I knew talked that way, certainly no one in Foster
Village. Some of the words I had never heard. What was a “lea?” Yet Mr. Forde was not going to explain.
He just stood there and read. Our brains were open lids and we were to sit there and take whatever was
thrown in, in the hope that years from now when we were old and bent like him it might come to

make sense to us. He raised the book to his chest, and we repeated in an uninspired drone:
