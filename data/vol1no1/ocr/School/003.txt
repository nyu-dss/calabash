ticket puncher in his palm and the thick bunch of tickets between his fingers, the wind whipping at
his shirt and face. Behind him the trees, poles, houses and people were a blur. When Gregory and I
played Bus in the window neither of us wanted to be the conductor. It seemed too dangerous.

At the end of the road was a traffic light, and the bus started to slow. The engine decelerated
loudly, and you could see the trees and the houses at the side of the road more clearly now. Ahead
of us was a lorry, its rickety wooden tray empty. The light turned red and the traffic in front of us
stopped, but we didn’t. The bus kept rolling slowly on.

Headley shouted, “Oh, Jesus Christ, No brakes!” He raised both hands in in the air and we
bumped into the back of the lorry, sending it forward. “No brakes!” And we bumped it again.

Immediately there were rumblings and a lot of anxious movements in the bus. No one was hurt
— we wete going too slow — but right away a crack appeared on the windshield, stretching
halfway across it like a smile, and a shot of steam erupted from the metal bonnet that had dented
like a condensed milk can. Headley got out to look and the lorry driver got out too.

“Sobers!” Headley called after a minute. “Tell the passengers to get off. Bus ent moving ftom here
no time soon.”

Sobers was already standing on the curb. He did as he was told and the mumbling started again.

“What we going do?” people were wondering aloud. “How we going where we going now?”

I didn’t care. The smile on the windshield matched the one across my heart, and I wished we
might stay here all day. In the road the traffic squeezed by, people slowing and stopping to look. A
bus passed, and another, both packed with people like sand. Maybe this day I would get lucky and
wouldn't go to school at all.

Headley squatted on the curb, elbows on knees, hands limp, head bowed, thinking. I had never
known him to have an accident before. He might have been in some kind of shock.

Muriel asked, “Wha’ ya going do, Headley?”

He took off his cap and looked at it, turning it this way and that. He spat out the frazzled stalk
of grass and plucked a fresh one. On his haunches he searched the cap as if for an answer, while we
waited to know what we were to do. Finally he replaced the hat, tilted it, and got up.

Across the road was a shop, a sign saying “Durant’s Grocery” at the front.

“Sobers,” Headley called, “go there by Miss Durant and beg she for a phone message, tell them
send another bus. Same time call the police.”

My spirits fell, even though that day I got to school a half an hour late.

There were twelve of us at Little Roses, Classes were held in the dining room and the garage. In
the dining room, the dark mahogany furniture was pushed aside to make room for our desks and
chairs and I always felt it was Miss Rose herself, or Skeete, her small dry housekeeper, who hauled
the heavy furniture across the room. Both of them were stern, unsmiling and overly mean. Skeete

prowled the kitchen and the yard with an apron on and a spoon or mop or some other implement
