T EIGHT YEARS OLD I HATED SCHOOL. The only person I knew who felt the same way
was Frupse, who left school at fourteen because he said that school couldn’t “learn” him a thing.

On mornings I did everything I could to procrastinate — misplaced a sock, spilled tea on my shirt
— or not to go to school at all.

Dear Aunt would warn, “Look, Trevor, try and hurry up at that table, ya hear, befo’ I come and
light a fire under ya lil behind with this belt.”

Little Roses Preparatory School, the private school I attended, was in Fairchild Gardens, a good
ways from Foster Village. On mornings I had to take the bus. The bus stop stood twenty yards from
the top of the hill, twenty yards from the Junction where the Main Road, the Cross Road, Windmill
Road and Foster Hill met — the busiest intersection in the village. Here were the rumshop, Miss
Waterman's dry goods’ shop, and the standpipe ten yards away from her door. At eight in the morn-
ing people were going here and there, gathering water at the standpipe, and on Miss Waterman’s
step an old woman named Mrs. Callender was already sitting at her fruit and vegetable tray. The bus
stop was crowded, and more people stood on the sidewalk at the Junction itself. The bus would come
down the Main Road and turn left down the Hill, and as it stopped or slowed at the corner the peo-
ple would jump on.

I heard it before I saw it, a rattling red woodpecker, open at the sides like a tram. I heard the
engine singing all the way up the Main Road. When it got to the corner the people jumped on, and
at the bus stop they climbed on too, filling the rows to bursting. People squeezed into the tiniest of
spaces, made spaces where there were none before, lifted children onto their knees. In every row,
bags and feet and baskets cluttered the floor. I stood back, watching, not eager to get on, not caring
if I was left behind. I would catch the next bus, whenever it came, even if it meant I got to school
late. If I was lucky, the next one would be just as full, and the next, and I would be so late I would-
n't have to go to school at all.

The conductor wore a khaki uniform and cap, brown leather purse over his shoulder. I watched
as he stood on the sidewalk helping people on, hoisting bulky baskets over his head, pacing the side-
walk to see that every crevice was filled.

“Size down, size down,” he called. “My lady, see if ya could size down a lil bit there.”
