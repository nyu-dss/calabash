minute school ended Miss Rose came out to the verandah and sat like a guard, knees crossed, cor-
recting work or sipping tea, keeping us in check with her presence. Some afternoons she gave a les-
son on the faded old piano in the living room, but still there was Skeete to mind. Sterling and I
waited for just the right time when Miss Rose or Skeete wasn’t looking, to slip down the driveway
to the edge of the road where from the house we couldn’t be seen behind the wall.

Sterling was eight like me but just a little taller He had a lighter complexion and his nose was
not as broad or as crooked as mine. His hair was short and curly, brushed and parted at the side. We
stood next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, at the edge of the road. I tipped my chin, raised my
shoulders, started willing myself as tall as 1 could, to see if maybe I had grown an inch or two in
the past few days. I hadn’t. Next I held my elbow to his, turning it this way and that, inside and out,
holding it just so to catch the favor of the sun that sifted through a yellow-poui tree across the road,
to see if I had gotten fairer. I knew there was something good about being fair. Why else would my
mother and Dear Aunt call me out of the midday sun all the time, warning me that I was going get
“too black.”

Sterling smiled triumphantly. “You not as light as me.”

It was another thing I envied about him: his speech. In Windmill Road no one spoke that way,
not even my mother. Sterling said nor, in the gap we said ent: “You ent as light as me.”

Some days Sterling said, “My Daddy not coming for me today. My Mommy coming for me,” and
it sounded as luscious and exotic as Mr. Forde’s poetry, It might have been a different language, even
though we were two small boys from the same small island attending the same small school. It was
the way my mother wanted me to speak.

At home I tried it, standing in front of the mirror, walking around the yard. “You not as light as
me,” I would say, looking around to make sure no one was listening. “My Daddy not coming for me
today.” But it sounded ill fitting and wrong, as ridiculous as gold teeth in a pig’s mouth. I didn’t dare
talk that way around Winston or Dexter or anyone else in the gap. Oh, how I wanted to talk like
Sterling, to roll the English language around like a paradise plum on my tongue

“Bye-bye, Trevor,” Sterling said. “I going to see you tomorrow.” | looked to see his father’s gray
Jaguar gliding up the road. It seemed to float rather than roll on its wheels, so that it was virtually
soundless.

Sterling ran up the driveway for his bag that lay at the foot of the wall. I stepped aside as the car
backed into the driveway, only the sound of the gravel crunching under its wheels. Behind the closed
windows the doctor was inaccessible and large. Sterling got in and closed the door behind him, snug
as a handclap, and now he seemed distant, too. Through the glass I could see neither of them clearly,
just the reflection of my small self against the wall. The car pulled out onto the street and whispered
off. I went up the driveway for my bag, threw it over my shoulder, and headed down the road. A
quarter of a mile away at Casuarina Road I would wait for the woodpecker bus. 2
