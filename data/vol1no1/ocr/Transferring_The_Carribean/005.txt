But then, your characters in Voices in the Wind speak a very refined language — the language
Q. the “colonizers” (or, as Tom Wolfe would say, “Masters of the Universe”) — and this leads

me to something that’s been bothering me for a while. Is there a real difference between

the “whites” in Caribbean Babylon and the Aftican-American bourgeois in Voices in the Wind?

Not much except perhaps the color of their skin.

Do you see any parallels between certain powerful African-American characters (in such plays
oe Voices in the Wind) and the European colonizers of near and distant past?

Yes, very definitely. That’s why the play was written. To illustrate, through drama, how far
A « _ from our original goals we have strayed. (The play of course is a futuristic fantasy so it can-
not be accepted as historical or sociological fact. It’s really one writer playing with: “What

if - ?” and asking, “Where are we going?”

The dialogue in the play is written to be deliberately banal and echo that of the white
bourgeoisie we once called oppressors. The dramatic question at the center being, “Have
we become a new form of what we fought against?” The true villain in this piece to me is
capitalism.

When you have the rich folks in Voices in the Wind define themselves as “quality people” (as
OU ee to “servants, service guys. People of no consequence”), do you hear the echo of the

famous definition of the British upper classes at the turn of the century as “good people”?
Yes, for sure. And as I indicated before, that was part of my intention in writing the play. To
e have them echo and repeat what had been said by others (the colonizers of the past) with-
out being aware they were doing so. The voices on the wind that we hear is intended to

serve as an ironic counterpoint to all that.

Is there such a thing as a Caribbean play? If there is, what is it that makes it Caribbean? Do
Ola believe there are certain traits that identify any artistic work (also literary) as

Caribbean? And how would you define your own writing, in matters of belonging?

This is a tough question for me because I can’t answer it in any satisfactory way. Therefore
A - I'm not going to try.

I'll only explain that the reason it’s tough is because I have lived in the United States

continuously from 1959 to now. When I visited the Caribbean (St. Thomas, V.I. where I

was brought up), it was only on periodic vacations to see my parents. Last March on an
