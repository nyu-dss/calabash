Actually the NEC still exists. But due to the deficit and several attempts at reorganization, they
A » _ have been only sporadically active as a producing entity.

I was an aspiring playwright before my involvement with the NEC. I became a pro-
fessionally produced playwright because of the NEC. Specifically because of its artistic
director, Douglas Turner Ward.

How the NEC experience influenced my view of myself as a playwright is that it
gave me confidence. It told me that my playwriting voice was as worthy as any other to
be put on the stage and be scrutinized by critics and the public alike.

My work ethic was something that I consciously developed on my own, but the
NEC, via its continuous production of my plays, inspired me to continue trying and to

work harder.

Q." you see the possibility of a similar theater opening anywhere in the U.S.?

There are many African American theatres now operating all over the U.S. Some are profes-
A « sional companies, but most are community based.

The NEC was unique because it was created at a specific time to fulfill a specific

need. And that was to give theatrical voice to the African American community of the time.

In its original formation the NEC trained actors, directors, designers, publicity people and

playwrights. But it was primarily a playwright’s theatre. And for 25 years, one quarter of

a century, it produced 4 new black plays each year. And in so doing, it added many works

to the now accepted literary canon of the American stage. This was a unique and spectac-

ular contribution. I don’t see any theatre in the U.S. (at this moment) providing this service.

It may be possible that there is one or more out there doing it but I'm not aware of them.

The possibility of someone opening a similar theatre always exists. But to do it one

would need to construct a bold artistic vision that would address the needs of this time.

I’m optimistic that it will happen. I just don’t know when.

Can you name a person or persons who have influenced your work, be they writers, artists
Q. « ordinary people.

There were many but the two who come quickly to mind are:
© J. Antonio Jarvis— in St. Thomas. A local historian, teacher and artistic jack of all trades. He
started a newspaper, taught school, wrote plays, wrote a history of the Islands, painted a
little, wrote poetry, and played music. I studied one summer with him. It was an unforget-

table experience.
