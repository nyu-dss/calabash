invitation from the Humanities Department of the University of the Virgin Islands was the
only time I visited the area as an artist or scholar. During that week I got to meet several
Caribbean writers and scholars first hand. And I got to read their work as well. Prior to
that I'd read the works of several Caribbean writers who were widely published in the U.S.
(Kincaid, Naipaul, Walcott, Churchill, etc.) and thought of them as individual phenomena
and not part of a collective identified as “Caribbean.” Now I do because I've read a lot
more Caribbean writers whose names are not as recognizable as those | just mentioned and
I see common themes, concerns, etc., showing up in all their works.

In defining my own writing I don’t think I fit into this pattern as of yet. Virtually all
my adult years have been spent in the United States. This doesn’t mean that I am of the
US. But it does indicate that I was not around the Islands when so many Caribbean writ-
ers were developing what is now identified as a distinctive Caribbean voice.

I am Caribbean but my development, artistically speaking, is both Anglo Saxon and
African American. This gives me a sort of hybrid identity which I think is unique and
interesting if I can find valuable ways to utilize it in my work.

My rediscovery and investigation of my own Caribbean background/culture is too
recent for me to discuss it with any clarity whatsoever. I view it as part of a growth process.
A process, by the way, I always thought I would arrive at, at some time or other. I just didn’t
know when. But here I am.

Ask me the same question 3 to 5 years from now and I think then I might be able

to give you a clearer response.

- visual or theatrical effect. Can you elaborate on that?

Os plays I've read are set on a rather austere stage, as if suggesting a vacuity beyond the

A.

Sure. This represents a personal bias. And the bias is this: For virtually all the years of my play-

going in the US. (especially Broadway in New York) I've always felt that too much empha-
sis was placed on the design elements of a play, frequently at the expense of content and
characterization. Also I felt that this emphasis on opulent and (more often than not) expen-
sive production trappings endowed the theatre with a kind of empty materialism that I
found repugnant to my personal theatrical aesthetic.

Beyond that, I also thought it elitist. Because it is saying in certain ways that only
people with a substantial amount of money, or access to it, can or should practice theatre.
That to me is absurd and snobbish in the extreme. So in my work I try to write so that
anyone or group, no matter what their financial circumstances are, can do the play, and if

they have the talent, realize its full artistic potential.
