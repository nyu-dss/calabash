The most extreme step I've taken in the direction of “spareness” in the theatre was with
the play Confesstonal. One of the challenges I gave myself when I was writing it was to create
a work that required no set, no special lighting set-up, no costumes and not even a theatre. All
that was necessary is a bare light bulb and a chair. The actor could be dressed in whatever he
was wearing that day when he performed it. And the play could be done anywhere. In a liv-
ing room, on a street corner, in a park, a restaurant, a church or even in a theatre.

A question about language: The discoursive capacity of Clark in Conjesstonal threw me off a
OF He appears, to me at least, somewhat too refined, too educated, for the kind of char-
acter he portrays. As if holding back something, a secret perhaps that he keeps hidden

from us even while confessing. Was this a conscious choice, or am I totally wrong here?

This was a conscious choice. I wanted to indicate that behind the facade of refine-
ment and education a monster can reside. And perhaps this hidden monster was in part cre-
ated by an unhealthy confluence of education and refinement.

I directed the first production of this play and extended this idea even further in my
choice of actor to play Clark. I selected someone who unconsciously projected education,
refinement and trustworthiness. That to me is the threat of the play. Clark is the
Frankenstein monster we've created. Only thing now is he doesn’t look like a monster. He
looks like one of us.

[A biographical question] What was the artistic climate in St. Thomas when you still lived
Oy and did the move to the US cause a shift in your artistic outlook?

To the best of my knowledge, there was none. In the area I grew up, art was considered a
A ¢ luxury and an indulgence. An attempt by lazy and worthless people to get out of doing
“real” work. It was ridiculed and frowned upon by adults.

I went to the U.S. (New York specifically) because I thought I could find and become
part of a community that would be more sympathetic to my artistic leanings. It took some
time but I did and that is when I began to develop an artistic outlook.

So nothing shifted from the Island to the U.S., because there was no outlook prior to
my living in America.

For many years you were active with the Negro Ensemble Company, which in 1991 closed
oLge due to a $250,000 deficit. Has the NEC experience influenced your view of your-

self as a playwright?
