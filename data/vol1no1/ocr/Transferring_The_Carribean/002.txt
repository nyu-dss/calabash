In New Century/New Learning: Diaspora and Continuum you quote, or possibly state your own

QU

« opinion, saying, “Our aesthetic is performative, and not didactic. In practice it subverts the

European definition of aesthetic [...] Resistance is central to the aesthetic. The work of
African American artists is based upon resistance. This aesthetic subverts the hegemonic
character of the European tradition. In the process it amplifies our self-definition.”

Does that mean that resistance (or disavowal) of European aesthetic is required for
the development of the black American aesthetic?

In the article, New Century/New Learning, etc. the quote concerning the “Black Aesthetic” was

taken from an ongoing attempt to identify what the Black Aesthetic in theatre is. It was not
written by me but by a group of African American artists and scholars, the principal inves-
tigator being Dr. Beverly M. Robinson of UCLA. It was one of the reports that came out
of the “On Golden Pond” symposium at Dartmouth College in 1998. My inclusion of it
in my article was as a form of reportage, but also because I fully agree with its philosophy.

Before going on, I'd like to make one thing clear concerning this so-called “Black
Aesthetic Manifesto.” This document is a work in progress that is constantly being altered
when some new insight or perspective is illuminated or discovered. Things can be removed
or changed while others can be added. It is a flexible document designed to be altered or
change with the times, because it is being developed to hopefully serve the needs of
African American theatre artists at various and different times in our history.

So what I guess I’m saying is that the document is not written in stone, although the
basic tenets it espouses are steadfast.

In direct answer to your question I think yes it means some sort of resistance or dis-
avowal of the European aesthetic because for too long this has been the critical yardstick
by which all of our work is measured even when in content and in form the work is clearly
in opposition to that paradigm. Therefore a clean break must be made if we're going to
make a serious attempt at redefining artistically who we are and where we're coming from.

It is my perception that your earlier plays (The Offering, for one) were, to my definition, closer

Qu

« to what one may call “European aesthetic.” Would you agree to such view, and if you do,

could you point to a moment in time when you embarked on a course that one may say is

guided by a “performative aesthetic” so brilliantly exemplified in Caribbean Babylon.
