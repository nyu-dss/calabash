Calabash

The breadth of his knowledge and his imaginative approach to teaching (by this I
mean he eschewed orthodox methods when he felt another approach would be more use-
ful), were things I never forgot. He took a dim view of the acquisition of practical knowl-
edge and placed an emphasis on developing a philosophical approach to life. He
encouraged an interest in the arts as a means of both intellectual and emotional pleasure.

He also encouraged one to live a moral life. Not morality based on religious precepts.
But morality based on decency, patience, a kindly outlook, understanding of your fellow man and
a generosity of spirit that would eliminate snobbery of any kind. He also encouraged me to
be a bold thinker and to pursue my dreams no matter how difficult that might prove to be.

The other is Douglas Turner Ward who by the example of his own life has taught me
to never apologize for who I am, what I think or how I write. It is easy to say: “To thine
own self be true.” It is something else to practice it. Doug Ward does. And that is and has

always been an inspiration to me. @#
