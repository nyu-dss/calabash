Oh yes. Absolutely. They (the earlier plays) were not just close to the “European aesthetic,”

they were completely steeped in it and written out of that influence because at that time
my knowledge of and education was all about European theatre. And only about it. Asian,
African, Latin American or Caribbean theatre didn’t exist for me. Just European and
American theatre did. Those were the ones I knew about and thought valid. Therefore
when I embarked on my own playwriting career those were the models I worked from.

I'm not exactly sure when I began to move closer to working out of a “performative
aesthetic,’ but my best guess is that it began somewhere around 1988-89, ten or eleven
years after my first work (The Offering) had been produced. Two things, I think, prompted
the move in that direction. One was the fact that I had become restless (creatively speak-
ing) about what I was doing. The kinds of plays I was writing. It seemed to me that I was
covering the same ground over and over in various ways. I was in search of new directions
and new forms to stimulate and challenge me.

It also annoyed me that I was being compared to the British playwright, Harold
Pinter. I like and greatly admire his work, but I do have my own identity and I wanted to
assert that (through my work) in a more forceful way. So I tried various forms and stum-
bled on the monologue/direct address style of Caribbean Babylon. It was really to explore
and work out of the oral tradition of African and Caribbean storytelling.

Secondly, I think the older we get the more we become curious about our past, and
the impact the experiences of our formative years might've had on who we've become as
adults. I know this was true of me anyway. So I wrote a play, Ramona, which was
announced and scheduled for production by the NEC, then canceled at the last minute due
to budget constraints, I had worked hard on that play. It had taken some time, a lot of
thought and a lot of revisions to get it (on paper at lest) to the point where it was satis-
factory to me. When it was cancelled, I understood why, but still I was disappointed.
Because I wanted to see the play reach its full point of realization, which is of course pre-
sentation on a stage before some kind of audience.

Still, its existence and the work I had put into getting it down on paper represented
some sort of breakthrough (or break from the past) and led the way toward Caribbean
Babylon.

I hasten to add that I am always playing (experimenting) with form and style. Caribbean
Babylon represents one step in that direction but there have been others since then.
