» sort of new medieval play where each character represents a vice or a virtue?

Quorn Babylon to be considered a choral play, an exercise in point of view, or rather a

I guess one could call it all of the above. I think that if I was directing it, 1 would approach
- _ it from that perspective. When I was writing it, I didn’t think of it in that manner. It just
evolved that way.

Would you say that the play’s form is influenced by Kurosawa’s Rashomon, ot even by Robert
Q. Browning The Ring and the Book?

I don’t know. I think this whole business of specific influence is difficult, if not impossible,

A « to pin down. I’m certainly aware of the works that you've mentioned but have no idea how
they influenced the style or content of Caribbean Babylon, if indeed they did influence it at

all. In fact, I never thought of them in relation to that work until you mentioned it. I’m

not saying that you're right or wrong, I’m just saying that I don’t know.

I may be going too far in my interpretation, but I see the native boys in Caribbean Babylon as a
Q) metaphor for the island: After colonizing the island through force and violence and
after setting it free, the colonizer comes back and with the power of money colonizes the
body/island, his/its culture, his/its integrity. First came the exploitation of the islands,

which could provide fruits, spices, and land for European outcasts. Now comes the exploita-

tion of bodies, the trade in flesh for daily consumption by white men and women alike.

Now the body/island is not only degraded but actually stripped of its dignity, dispossessed

of any illusion of freedom. Yet the characters in your play entertain the illusory dream that

money earned through degradation will set them free. Do you personally see any hope for

your characters, are you optimistic about their chances of winning redemption?

Your interpretation is a good one. And it’s as valid as any other I suppose. As the creator of
A « _ the piece, I am not objective enough to stand away and view it from an analytic or inter-
pretive perspective. When I wrote it, I wasn’t thinking about those things. I was more con-
cerned with making the characters dimensional and dynamic (in a theatrical manner)

within the confines of the form I had chosen for this material.
Interpretation is the business of the viewer or audience, I think. A good work is open
to any number of interpretations. But I think it’s foolhardy for a writer to embark on

attempting to interpret the meaning of his/her own work.
