Anthuriums

Grandmummyâ€™s mind left her
and went back to De Country.
No one talks to her plants
comfort her anthuriums

pick her orchids

scream for snakes.

I passed through Cochrane Village
last summer: De Ol House

home to addicts or abused

now was overgrown with her life
turned to weeds and crabgrass
paint flaking fading lonely

like an old hag once beautiful.

Grandmummy followed her mind

back to De Country the other day

where heart-shaped anthuriums grow

in abundance and only Mummy could

go down to see her off. Mummy came back
empty-handed and eyes-dry

(no mention of a will)

but she paid her last rites

and gardened more than ever

potting anthuriums like tombstones

waiting for the libation from the sky.
