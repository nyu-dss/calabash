Untitled I

Gentle, and more gentle still

like flowers, but fallen

or half drowned,

these small words like seeds

that grow into islands —

I see you have found the flat shadows

of mountains and the ends of meanings.

I cannot begin,

not knowing the way,

not believing the sign;

I wait and forget

and return —

The vining hand, this
branching sentence remains.

You remark upon the time.
