Alzheimerâ€™s Disease

Grandmummy mumbles and babbles
in no particular time or space
thinking that Uncle Ray, big man

married with children, is still in school.

Everyone whispers over her head
like high class muck-a-mucks,
mourning the memory

that Mr. Alzheimer holocausted,

as if we, too, had not forgotten

as if our minds did not stay behind
as if we all had never crossed

that Styxian sea of senility.
