Calabash

Still Anansi spins delicacies of the discovery...

Made by the poet
Meaning to capture

Elusive Anansi

With his camera,

But instead

The sly spider

Made a mockery of Kodak

As he left behind immortalized on celluloid

Not his likeness
But a dark haunted face,

Full mouth slack with anguish

Left eye lolling aimlessly

Right window burning with
Blinding concentric circles of light
And raising only gooseflesh and
Unanswered questions

Spin Anansi spin...

Your silvery secrets passed

From one arachnid generation

To the next

And the shroud of each oneâ€™s destiny
Carefully coiled within.
