a

Kamau's Spider

A curious lens dares to
Encapsulate elusive Anansi
Entwining his fate

With ‘Cow Pastor's’

Swaying grass

Banshee wind

And the sweetest dunks on earth

Spinning glistening silver delicacies

Into a silver thread of hope

For the poet

With the ascetic brown face
Weary with the ways of the world

Spinning your strong delicacies of lore...

About spirit elders

Hardy with the clamoring, clanking pain
Of the middle passage

Now beseeching us

To respect their peace

Their blood journey

Not end in crystalline coral

And fecund earth,

But continual travel

Throughout these dumb ventricles
Of our very core
