I Think I Saw Apollo Weeping

Amber tears seeping
Through cracks

In his body

Carved in marble white
Lost the silent beauty
He was keeping

Under fiery sun

For his eternal bride

I think I heard Apollo sighing
Mutilated limbs

Through time eroding

Inspiring songs

Only Orpheus could remember
Lamenting his dismembered corps
Sucked dry the saps

From his loins exploding

I think I felt Apollo bleeding

Dark blood streaming

From his torso

Undulating under stroboscopic light
Stripping

His jockstrap gleaming

Sacrificing loveâ€™s memory

Shrouded by darkness
Of Dyonisian night

I think I saw Apollo weeping
