Boundaries

Should the ties that bind

Cut off the breath that gives us
Peace while birth wrongs

And rights come back to haunt us
To roost

Should the ties that bind betray
The heart the purity of agape
with viral strains

At the rings that bind us

(worn on the akward hand)

Should the ties that bind
