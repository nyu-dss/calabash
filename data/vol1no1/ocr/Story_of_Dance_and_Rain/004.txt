girl gets in trouble if she does not bow to my whims. I am the only person who can watch this film
I screen.

How many months have passed since that night? How many moons and tides? How many
swings, furtive smiles on different dance floors? Exchanging glances during classes and managing to
avoid the teasing of the others. Talking on the phone until dawn declaiming Aragon’s or Préverts
poems. Laleau’s and D’avers’. Davertige’s also. Until we meet that Saturday. A few days before the
big separation.

I see the beach again. In the middle of the week. We are alone. Once more. Several waiters cater
to us. They knowingly wink at me. We are young and smile. A fisherman paddles towards our direc-
tion. He offers us (more to me than you) seafood.

Seafood grilled on fire wood and marinated with lemon juice. Rumored to be aphrodisiac. I don’t
need that at my age (twenty years old) but I play the game. Talking about game something comes to
my mind now. From time to time I slip away to glance at the soccer game on TV. The Brazilian soc-
cer team is playing against another team whose name I don’t know. It’s the World Cup. It’s June or
July. You're not happy. But you know my passion for the Brazilian team. You pout. I kiss you on the
neck every time I slip away or come back. The game will soon finish. | am happy that Brazil won.

I draw you to me. You resist. I run towards the ocean to pick an algae. I give it to you by way of
a flower. Conquered. We walk arm in arm towards the bungalow. We come out shortly. After tire-

lips greedily devour them like a new born hungry for flesh. Your flesh. But we can’t go any further.
Because of that other guy you never told me about. (Weird he likes the soccer team “Heavenly
whites” the Brazilian rival team. He is as much expansive as I am reserved. As bottle prone as I am
sober. He has many qualities and flaws that make the two of us the two faces of your life.)

You will never tell me about it. I will have only guessed. Then I will have understood while liv-
ing abroad when I learn of your marriage. It must have been your first love. It drives me crazy. Not
because he loved you before I did. But not to able to fully express your desire. You will not tell me
anything. You keep repeating the same refrain: “Try to understand that I can’t.” Understand what?
And accusing me of being like the others. Only interested in going to bed with you. “But a girl is
not stupid.”

You become vulgar and that does not seem like you at all. I stop our chaste petting. | become
mute. I don’t really want to. But it would be impossible for me to talk without being infuriating.
Disappointed.

I stayed in bed viewing my inner cinema. An hour passed. Maybe two. Or would it be that a few
minutes seemed so long? You ask me if I want to go home. I get dressed. It looks like you want to
