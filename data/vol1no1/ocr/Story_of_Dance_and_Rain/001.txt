Story Of Dance And Rain

AM TWENTY. IT RAINS AND WE DANCE AROUND IN A CIRCLE. We hear the sound
I of the rain on the corrugated iron roof. An animated percussionist’s jam session stirs the entire
rhythmic section in a frenzied mood. The music strokes rotate between sensuality and frenzy. Between
a slow sound and jerks of a crazy submachine gun. We are alone that night. Two people in love. You
curl up against my heart. Hesitating between relaxing and scratching like a terrorized feline. This
desire of vengeance in your eyes. “Why did I in front of you wrap myself around this ebony sculp-
ture on the dance floor. Why did I hug her so close? Eh, admit it. Anybody could see that that you
craved the desire to do so. You could not stop yourself from fondling her. To glide your hands along
her back. You all but, nearly touched her buttocks. Besides, I don’t know what kept you.” Words yelled
between the teeth but whispered in the murmur of the rain and the rumpling of bodies.

I smile. I am twenty. I won't tell you that your jealousy is not justified. I have not even kissed her
yet. I who very early tasted flesh as a forbidden fruit offered to a hungry man. Mere glances of con-
nivance between us at the university some time ago. And a restrained strange attraction. Like to pre-
vent a vehicle of which we would not have any control from going off the road. Then two or three
phone calls. Long like nostalgia. From the native land. Of a lost love or friendship. We call each other
to say nothing. Aragon’s poems and Prévert’s. Laleu’s or d’Avers’. Phelps’ also. Which one of the two
had asked or offered his/her phone number?

I am twenty. Twenty-one may be. It rains and the music plays for us. Isolated in the middle of
so much disturbance. Like a boat whose strength defies the entire ocean. Time stopped. Since
yesterday. Since a long time ago. Since I have known you or have dreamed to know you. As a matter
fact, have I existed before? There are some who will acknowledge that I did but I dont recall that
anymore.

It does not rain yet. Across mine your gaze is riveted to inaccessible dreams of suffering and love.
The wave of the night. They cross each other. Reluctant. Before stepping in the music people sway

their hips in a demented motion. Mute dialogue. Sometimes disturbing sometimes conciliating from
