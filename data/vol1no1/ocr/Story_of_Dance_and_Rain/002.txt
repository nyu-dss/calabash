which we are both excluded. What could they probably have to say? I get up. Go by your side with-
out talking to you. You join me again on the dance floor. Under a huge arbor similar to a big péristyle!
located in the middle of the backyard. Far from the jumble of the tables and the bar. We pretend to
dance. Your eyes riveted to mine. “You wanted it. Admit it.” I turn my head away and ignore your
question, You sink your nails in the nape of my neck. I look at you and smile. A yellow smile. It is
not part of the game. You feel my stiff body resisting your embrace. A light wind floats in the air.

The rain suddenly starts roaring. Its heavy vertical drops penetrate the flesh of the earth. Keeping
us from getting off the dance floor. Compelling us to continue playing the music for a long, never-
ending dance. We dance. That we become giddy. With our eyes closed we have no sense of time of
the day and night. We did not dance to the music that alternates with the murmur of the rain. Our
steps lead us to another tempo. Music that our minds quietly transmit to our awakening bodies. Yours
I imagine intoxicated with the moment of old declaimed poems until the end of the night and the
patience of the family members wanting to use the phone. Mine drunk with rum-coca, Cuba is a
free woman in my mind. People restlessly dance around us. Sing in chorus with the musicians. It feels
like carnival.

We dance. Our steps harmoniously coordinate without ever sharing any common recollection.
Our bodies lightly touch, wrap around each other, let loose come closer. The sweet warmth of your
breasts against my chest. (You don’t wear a bra. As usual. I know the answer. “Why bother? They're
so small.” So tiny that I consider it a sacrilegious act to put my huge hands around them. I heard
that you gave birth. They must have gotten bigger. Will your son [or your daughter] know one day
that they had nursed me before him/her?) Two young fawns raise their heads to tickle my torso with
their tongue. They have always reminded me of Solomon. In my rigorously sabbatical childhood I
did not know that the Song of Songs was a love poem. Such things are not spoken of in the Book
of Books. But you're not Solomon’s model. Otherwise he would have talked about your buttocks.
Of this double splendor carrying in its cadence your youth and my craziest fantasies. Happy remi-
niscence of Africa from your mixed heritage.

I remember now the name of the night-club: “Zombz’. It sounds awful. We could have chosen
“Feu vert’ (Green light) the other well known club in this northern city. But the group wanted to go
to “Zombi’. Well, well there was another group with us that night. I remember now. Angelo Ricardo
Adelina Florencia Antonio Teodora Marina...

Where are they while we are dancing? We modestly hug each other.

The rain stopped a long time ago. The music also. And we keep dancing. In the middle of never-
ending conversation of couples waiting for the next song to play. The music starts again. You take
my hand and invite me to go outside. Thousands of stars add to the beauty of the night. The earth
exhales fresh and heavy effluvium. You don’t speak. I follow you like a good dog without asking

any question. We go into the night by the main highway on the sea side. Fifteen minutes after you
