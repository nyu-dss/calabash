jump over the rail you hold out your hand to me. Too proud of myself as a young beau I refuse to
take it. You are going to see what you are going to see. I jump and land with less flexibility than you.
You burst out laughing. And your laughter mixes with the undertow. Dying with it. Your virginal
body lying on the waves. I dream of you while swimming by your side. Lost in an old dream of
love. I have a hard time writing about it today. One will say these are poet’s words. But I don’t invent
anything, I swear. If there is poetry it is from that night. The black suns of the night met in your
mysterious eyes. What an idea to swim in the ocean at such a time! (Ten years later and thousands
of miles away I laugh when I think of it today. Such a crazy idea could only come from you.
Unpredictable. Prudish and debauched at the same time.) It is a bit chilly. The heat of the day totally
vanished. I take off my shoes and I move away from you. The contact of the sand under my feet. 1
carefully step on a few pebbles. I leapfrog like a tight- rope walker. You call me. And you lay back
on the water as if it were a bed. I guess it must be cold.

The others join us on the beach. Noticing our presence in the dark. I keep my eyes riveted on the
Big Dipper dreaming of taking you far away from this world. Your head deep in the ocean past mid-
night. They are all there: Antonio Teodora Angelo Marina... You come back shivering and wanted
to warm yourself in my arms. The others are ready to tease us. Their insinuations stop our gesture.
Our kisses in suspense that night. We could have been kissing so passionately. Like our dreams. The
desire to fight. To change our country. And our youth bursts with passion. Like an angry guitar.
Volcano of words about past and future injustices. About the father the son who had watched us
growing from birth on. We knew nothing else and we could only speak. All that more important
than our bodies that night.

I smile when I think of how you got this wicked initial by fate. Do you remember how often I
used to tease you. But you are kind in spite of the Nazis. Despite your initial. It was a game for young
people to play. Happy and angry. You know I have always chosen the right path because I stand by
our anger. Which sustains our fiery twenty years. Of course thorny. I have been walking through
these dreams. My steps retracing our memory. Confusing at times with it. Sometimes I look forward
to having other beautiful dreams. As if my life depended on it. But when I have dreams I don’t dare
go into them.

The rain slowly starts again. That night the rain will always start again. Like when we get away
ftom the ocean . The rum-coca imperceptibly penetrates into the land of my twenty years. With you
in my arms. Close to my heart. Heavier than I thought. I have a hard time climbing the forty steps
of the royal university to get to the dorms. Boys and girls separated according to their affinities and
boldness. I should have known that you're not bold. I drop you without saying good night.

Not very far your eyes looking for mine. I always pout when I don’t get what I want. As a child
I was spoiled by three women. Entirely devoted to my whims. Frightfully maternal. Besides I don't
know if they came from Egypt ... or nowhere. Maybe my inner cinema is playing a trick on me. A
