car. I start the car. I speed up. You did not ask me to slow down. Probably getting angry at yourself
at the world. But you are scared. I know it I feel it. You don’t say a word. Like me when I pout.
Tense. You put your seat belt on. You cling to the seat. So scared. I press my foot on the gas pedal.

I am infuriated. I am disappointed. I avoid looking at your face. Nor the face of death which
comes close under my feet. I press on the horn to free the way. The car speeds along the road . The
tree trunks seem coming at me. A final shock ejects me from the car. I feel drowsy and I hear you
crying. You will be unharmed by the accident. And I will take the next plane without saying good-
bye. With a plastered leg. My body and my mind bruised.

Until that letter. Where you talk about that dance as one of your best memories. The one among
those which does not make one suffer contrarily to popular belief. Perhaps it is so because it often
comes alone, carried by nobody, by the wind, by a dance, rarely linked to your name or my mem-
ory of you. And yet I owe it to you, but don’t even try to understand. This memory is particular. To
describe it as beautiful is not enough. Strong, tenacious, pure, sensual, innocent? A mixture of all of
that? I have rarely found one similar to that one which could define for me the word “Happiness”.
You say that you sent me a letter “in memory of that night. A way to say “Thank you.”

I am in Paris. I pour myself a last glass of rum. It’s five years old. (five years old gold Havana club
rum). A friend brought it for me from Havana. A fifteen hours flight with a stop in Montréal. I drank
it drop by drop for a long time. The bottle is full of history. I invent some other true ones ( still my
inner cinema). I retell them for my self with the habit of inventing stories for survival. What do I
know? Childhood stories that the maids used to sing while cleaning and cooking. Caribbean sto-
ries. Stories of crazy people. Dreams of guerrillas (1 wonder why this friend of mine always refused
to shave himself)...

Sorry for telling you all of that starting with a simple letter and an empty bottle. It is minus ten

degrees outside. I feel like taking a swim in the ocean. Paris, Fall 1992 es
