1, In 1745 the Reverend Thomas Thompson took three boys from the Gold Coast of Africa to Islington in England to receive
an English education under the auspices of the society for the propagation of the Gospel. Thomas Corboro died from

English wife Catherine, where he realized he had forgotten his native tongue.
