local laws or customs to complicate doing business?”

“Well, in both cases, there is legislation against actually owning beaches. In Barbados, beach sand
cannot be removed.”

“You're kidding me, right?” The CEO sat up in his chair, incredulous.

“Afraid not...”

“What’s the economic picture like?’ The CEO was going for this one, you could see it in the crease
lines on his forehead.

“2005 wasn’t good for them, removing trade tariffs and opening up their economies pretty much
screwed everything, but they’re still surviving with tourism and offshore banking.”

The CEO studied the map, the image of those two islands reflecting in his glasses, he chewed on
his pen for a few seconds, then flicked a switch underneath the desk. The lights in the room came
back to full strength and the map faded.

“GENTLEMEN, BRUSH UP ON YOUR CARIBBEAN CULTURE.”

Actually, it was less complicated than anticipated. Tobago was a walkover, Barbados was a bit
more tricky. The hardest part was explaining the micro-tunnelling devices. Why would a computer
chip manufacturer need to go digging? One of the PR execs thought up a really good one: the sandy
soil needed to be dredged down to bedrock to insert pylons before construction could start. The
local bureaucrats bought it.

It was straightforward after that. Sand extraction proceeded at about 1.4 metric tonnes per week
(any higher than that would produce detectible ground vibration). The processor chips were zipping
off the production line on time and under budget. Environmental groups came snooping around and
found that the plant’s waste emissions were well below UNEP recommended environmental toxic-
ity levels. Various charitable and sports organisations came cap in hand and Vision Microprocessors
sponsored four cricket clubs and three football teams. Hey, to keep the island’s beauty unspoiled,
they were actually replacing sand being quarried out. It was synthetic stuff with not an atom of sil-
icon in it, but you couldn’t tell it from real Bajan sand unless you knew what tests to perform... that
is, if you could get to it, since the extraction process was taking place about 20 feet below ground

level. Everything was working out.

EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE HARD-JAWED OLD MAN.

Nobody but him fished here. Strong currents and turbulent waters made this part of the east coast
unsuitable for swimming and the surfers did their thing further down the shore. Fishing boats, if
there were any, usually anchored at least two miles out. That was why they selected this area, for its
splendid isolation, and out of nowhere comes this old man every afternoon, casting his line out and
waiting. Sometimes the dead of night would find him still there.

They photographed him and ran his image through every database, no match. He wasn’t a Green
Peace operative, an overhead satellite had photographed the interior of his boat down to the last
