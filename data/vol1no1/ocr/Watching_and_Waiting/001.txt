Watching and Waiting

ATTHISON STOOD THERE AND WIGGLED HIS TOES, watching the sand cascade in mini rivulets

between them. This was so relaxing. He wanted to wiggle his toes forever, but the problem
would still be there when he looked up...then again, perhaps it wouldn’t. Matthison crossed his fin-

“I say, why don’t we bring industry to the people?”

“Pardon me, sir?” The official kept smiling but couldn't quite grasp what this computer guru was
