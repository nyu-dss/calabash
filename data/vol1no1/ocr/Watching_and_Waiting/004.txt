fish hook. No evidence of surveillance equipment. He was just an old fisherman, always chewing
on something that made his jaw muscles stand out. This made no sense, and Matthison didn't like
it. So today was the time to get to the bottom of this.

Looking directly at the old man, Matthison turned around slowly and whistled. With a whir of
solar-powered engines, a mini hovercraft sailed across the sand dunes and came to rest where
Matthison stood. The old man looked on dumbfounded as the hovercraft swirled over the sand and
effortlessly glided onto the water.

“Good afternoon, caught any fish yet?”

“No.”

“Oh, ain’t that a shame. Tell me something, how long you've had this little boat?”

“Near fourteen years.”

“How about exchanging it for this little baby? We've seen you fishing these last couple of months
and there’s definitely a need for a change in your routine. One of these hovercrafts equipped with
an electronic fish finder could do...”

“Thanks, but don’ worry.”

“Hey, don’t think of this as charity. We are all about giving back to the community.”

“Very good fuh you.” There was a certain finality about his words.

For the first time, Matthison was able to study this old man up close, hear his thick Bajan accent
and see his rather threadbare clothes, sitting in a rather dilapidated boat. This old geezer was sup-

“Hey, tell me, how do you like our little outfit?”

“How I likes your outfit? I likes it as much as this crab!” And with that, the old man retrieved from
the depths of his boat the stiff cadaver of a large crab and threw it into the hovercraft, startling
Matthison in the process.

“You asked me if I caught any fish, | didn’t, only dese land crabs.”

Something the old man said made Matthison do a mental double-take. “Hey, you caught /and
crabs out here? But land crabs don’t go in the ocean...”

“They do, if somet’ing chase dem out de sand.”

“Well, ...they probably got confused or something...you know, came up and missed their hole.”

“Boss man, land crabs ahvays know where to find their hole, and any land crab does got more
than one hole, and even a foolish land crab know de difference between water and land. I count at
least 30 crabs comin’ up through de seabed an’ drownin’. T'irty crabs could be so foolish, all
together?”

“Hey, damned if I know.” Matthison gazed intently at the old man, “What do you think?”

“I t'ink de land crabs drownin’ and de fish stayin’ away from here, I never see dat yet.” The old
