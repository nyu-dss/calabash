took off his glasses and nervously cleaned them on his tie, he wasn't comfortable with novel ideas.

“Listen, forget that twentieth century mindset for a second. Vision Microprocessors isn't into heavy
industry. We don’t need a four-lane highway paved all the way to our front door. Here, take a look."
Matthison whipped five RT-8 microprocessor chips out of his top pocket. “I could transport a thou-
sand of these in your average shopping bag . Welcome to eco-compatible manufacture, folks, wel-
come to the new millennium.”

That particular speech always did it. Everybody was so afraid to be seen as a relic of the twenti-
eth century.

The ribbon cutting ceremony for Vision Microprocessors was a big bash, a gala event on the island’s
Atlantic east coast attended by the governor-general, a bevy of assorted dignitaries and captains of
local industry. It was excellent strategy in several ways. The economic boom in the south-west of
the island had definitely not trickled over to this eastern parish. The road network, so well main-
tained in most of the other parishes, was practically crumbling here, especially in the area they called
the Scotland District. Something to do with land slippage, Matthison remembered reading.
Whatever the reason, there wasn’t even much cottage industry to talk about. Having a microproces-
sor manufacturing plant show up and_ provide at least fifty jobs (high-paying ones too) virtually
assured the area’s parliamentary representative of enough votes to last him into the next lifetime...

Matthison took his eyes off the old man and looked around at the magnificent cliffs, silhouetted
against the electric blue sky. He remembered a scenery very much different, just about a year ago, sit-
ting stiffly in a boardroom on the hundredth floor, watching antigravity hovercars whiz by just out-
side the window.

“Gentlemen, our 3000Mhz chip hasn’t done well.” The CEO always got to the point, stated the
bald truth and didn’t wait for a reaction, “We cant have another bad quarter, gentlemen, so here's
what I propose. Upgrade the purity of the raw silicon. Rex, tell us how we can do that.”

Matthison stepped forward, sweating profusely under his Armani suit, and started the presenta-
tion. The lights dimmed and a three dimensional map of the Caribbean slowly took shape in mid
air. “Gentlemen, the main problem with our current raw silicon sources is that none of them yield
above 20%. Our competitors have the same problem. Granite or volcanic sand doesn’t measure up.
However, sand derived from organic sources, such as coral, consistently yields 40% or more, this is
due to...”

“So, where do we start looking?” The CEO again, getting to the point.

“There are several Pacific atolls with coral-derived sand, but the infrastructure is lousy. There are,
however, two islands in the Caribbean region, Tobago and Barbados (Matthison pressed a button on
his handset and the 3D map zoomed quickly to show two rather non-descript low-lying land
masses). They look like good candidates.”

“So what’s the cultural angle?” Everybody in the room knew what the CEO really meant was ‘Any
