Moruga

We going country they said.

Down Deep South Trinidad

in search of Grandmummy roots.

Come to find crabgrass and troops

of chickens prancing and preening

on Guerrerro land like victors of war.
Foul-smelling turkeys mumbled and trembled,
wrinkled and miserable like haggish landlords,
where the wooden house used to stand.

On this road, La Lune Road, Grandmummy
chatter patois with Moruga women

and then listen out for her daddy broken
Spanish flicking at the sea breeze. She bathe
her brown-sugar-and-sand skin

and watch for Venezuela

mountains when the tide low

at the beach just a stone-throw

away. On the shore I saw nightmare-black
corbeaux flapping their wings

congregating like village people

making ready for death.
