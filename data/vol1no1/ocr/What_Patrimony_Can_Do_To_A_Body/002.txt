Calabash

I opened the door of my western shack,

Walked out â€” out of my meticulous shack to gather fuel.
[ got some dried up leaves

Sprinkled them generously through the ad hoc

Of my western living room.

[ got two bone white stones out of my head, rubbed them
Till they burnt my skin and catch the leaves.

My western shack burns like a klan cross

On the manicured lawn of some unsuspecting Negro.
While the shack burned, I skipped to my dessert,

The hyena in me laughing.
