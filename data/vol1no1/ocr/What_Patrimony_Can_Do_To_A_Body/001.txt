What Patrimony Can Do To A Body

Because of patrimony

I hung up my western name neatly
On a hook I found sleeping

In a corner of my house.

I undress in the corner,

Lift up some loose floor boards
And buried my western attire.

I cooked soup in the corner,
Boiling all my books from the western cannon.
I drank the soup, passed it out later,

In a black-hole corner.

Reclining on my bedroom floor,

My arms stretched a mile in opposite directions,
Palms tepid, wide open looking at the roof

Naked, except for the painful vice around the heels —

I took off my Oxford shoes,

Stretched the sole out on my window sill,
Gave it to the birds.

I looked at my feet torn and callused

My African toes glued together

Like a statue’s toes. | bent down

And straightened them out,

Viciously let in the air.
