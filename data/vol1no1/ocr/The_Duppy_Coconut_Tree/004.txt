MY FAVORITE TIME OF DAY WAS LATE EVENING when Mamrhalia was out in the town square
holding her prayer meeting and all the other houses in the yard were quiet. Under the Barringtonia
Mama would sing her childhood songs and tell me Anancy stories, or we would ask each other rid-
dles and play hand games. If we stayed out late enough, we would watch the large white flowers of
the Barringtona bloom, their fragrance briefly filling the air, for by the morning they would have
fallen to the ground, leaving behind only the hard inedible fruit.

After playing one evening, Mama left me alone in the house to go visiting. I watched her as she
dressed, straightening the scarf on her head and tucking the thick black plaits under. She wore her
pink sweater with the pearl buttons down the front that Papa had bought her during the early days
of their courtship.

While she was gone, I sat in the big mahogany rocking chair that dominated the parlor. Papa's
chair. He had not been home for two weeks but had sent money with one of the other workers, |
didn't think he would stay away much longer as he always said that Mama was the best cook in the
world. I rocked as I watched the shadows dancing in the flickering lamp light on the walls. It felt
strange being in the house without Mama, I had never been in the house alone. I rocked and
thought. Rocked and sang. Rocked and sang and thought. About going to school in the city. My
teacher was sure that I would pass the scholarship exam when I was twelve and, I had heard her
telling Mama, that I could board at the Catholic school there. I loved school, but I did not want to
leave Mama. She would have no one to protect her if I went and I was sure Mam‘halia would fol-
low me there and I would have no one to protect me either.

But I thought about it anyway and wondered if the children in the city would treat me kinder
than the children in my district did. There were only a few children who were brave enough to play
with a dundoos. The boys’ favorite name for me was “imanimal monkey” while the girls often
chanted, “Black is beautiful and White is corruption.”

Looking at my skin I hoped that it would darken as I grew older and thought that maybe I could
dye my hair. I looked in the polished mirror that hung in the room and tried to imagine myself with
black hair but couldn’t. | tried to imagine myself with dark skin but couldn’t do that either.

Night came. With no streetlights and no moon that night, it was pitch black outside. Mam’halia’s
meeting was long over but neither she nor Mama had returned. I pictured them coming up the road,
the gully on one side and the rocky hillside on the other. I worried about them crossing the ravine
on the old, narrow footbridge that everyone used as a short cut from the town square. The bridge
sways and the loose wooden slats creak underfoot. It was always easy for someone to miss their step
and fall. Many drunks had died that way over the years. Especially on moonless nights. I thought of
Maas Georgie and his kindness to me, and of his mother whom he said was also an albino. Maybe
Mama, Papa and I could move to her district...
