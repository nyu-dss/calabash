proposal. He had gradually added the other rooms at an angle, so that the first room remained
slightly in front, then the porch which connected the two ends of the house and, finally, the lattice
work which allowed cool air to pass through the rooms. Somehow that first room had become
Mam halia’s. It had only one window and standing on the roots of the duppy coconut tree | would
polish the outside of it’s dusty pane with my fists, peering into the dim interior which seemed as
ancient and mysterious as Ma’halia herself.

That day as I rubbed the window it creaked open. More excited than afraid I climbed in and sat
on the red chenille spread that covered the high, wide bed. Next to me a Bible lay open to the book
of Psalms, I breathed in the smell of Bay Rum, Eucalyptus Oil and Tiger Balm that hung heavy in
the air. The bed swallowed most of the space in the room; a rocking chair, a mahogany wardrobe
and a long table covered with a white lace cloth, occupied what was left. On the table, three red can-
dles stood guard, stuck in their own wax to the table cloth, around a large picture Bible with gold-
edged pages. Under the table were jars and bottles of potions which Mahalia made herself to use
in her healing. Pictures of the Sacred Heart, the Madonna and the Last Supper hung on the walls
along with plaques and crosses of all types. My eyes swept the room again and there was Mamhalia
standing in the doorway, gold teeth gleaming on her wizened face. The staff towered over her and
her white frock flapped around her meager frame.

“Duppy gal?”

Hot urine pooled beneath me even before she struck the first blow. My cries and Mamhalia’s
curses brought Mama and several people to the duppy coconut tree.

“You must be a mad woman!” Mama screamed, flying at Mam’halia with her arms raised.

Maas Georgie, new to the district and married to one of the women in the yard, was the only per-
son besides Mama who dared challenge Mam’halia. “You can’t beat a child with that heavy stick...”

“Child? Is a duppy!”

“Stop the foolishness Mam’halia, my mother look just like Hope and see me?” He thrust his mus-
cled arms forward, “Black as tar.”

“But we don’t know where you come from. Could be hell. Me Mahalia Burke travel the length
and breadth of this island and me never see no human look suh.” She held her staff high over her
head. “Two snake... the woman and her gal pickney. My family have no use for them.”

Later Mama and I lay curled in her soft bed, enveloped in the fragrance of rose water. Her strong
brown arms, stark against the paleness of my skin, cherished and strengthened me.

“Mama, how Mamhalia can love God and be so wicked? Don’t God say love one another? Don't
God love me Mama? Don’t is God make me?”

“Yes Hope, is God make you and Him love you. Me love you too, and a mother’s love is the best love.”
