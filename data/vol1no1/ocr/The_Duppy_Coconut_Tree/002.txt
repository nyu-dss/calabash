lickle gal always sick? You may as well stop feed her.”

She would always say things like that knowing full well how her words traveled on the cool
evening breeze through the leathery leaves of the duppy coconut tree and into the kitchen to Mama
and me. Mama's mouth would tighten and her black eyes flash, but she would remain silent until
Papa came inside,

“Mass Rueben, you know I don’t like when Mam‘halia say those things. Is not any body fault
Hope look different ...”

“Lawd Esther, Mam’halia is an old woman, you can’t follow everything she say.”

“I don’t trust her, especially after all them things that happen.”

“Cho woman, you always bring up that. Them was nature, even Nurse Bailey say so.”

“Nature? Three gal baby just dead like that and them did born good? Hope only alive today
because she never born here and was staying at Aunt Rose till now. You can believe what you like,
but I is a mother and I know Mamhalia have something to do with it. She is one wicked old woman
and I don’t want her living here.”

From my hiding place behind the cabinet turned cater-cornered in the kitchen, I would see Mama’s
tears and watch Papa’s clumsy attempts to comfort her with his big arms around her shoulders. He
would implore her to see the honor of having his grandaunt live with us because of her great age
and spiritual gifts. To Papa and the people of our district Mam’halia was a healer and a prophet.

Poor Papa. In those days we never said much to each other, but he always remembered to bring
me parcels of paradise plum sweets wrapped in brown paper. For the longest time Mama was all I
had. I often asked her about the dead babies, what their names were and where they were buried.
But she would only shush me and say I asked too many questions. She baked puddings, made peanut
and coconut cakes, gizzadas and roasted corn to make asham, all of which she sold from a glass case
set up on our porch. Except when I was in school, she took me everywhere with her, or at least tried
to keep me within sight. One day though, I slipped into the neighboring yard to see the newborn
piglets and Mam’halia pushed me into the sty. I still have the scars on my legs where the sow bit me.
Mama sat on the steps with me on her lap, rocking and humming and wiping my cuts and tears with
her big apron. She hugged me tightly and I hugged her back.

“Many halia push me Mama.”

“Hush...she think she can kill off all my pickney but in the Bible, Esther saves her people.”

We never told Papa; Mama had said it was our secret.

THEN THERE WAS THE DAY MAM’HALIA caught me in her room. Our house, except for the
zinc roof, was made entirely of pine and Mama kept it immaculate. She often told me the story of
how Papa had built one room and carried it by truck from his district to hers as part of his marriage
