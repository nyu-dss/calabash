The Duppy Coconut Tree

OU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHERE MAM’HALIA HAD BEEN by the naked footprints,
Vtee she never wore shoes, and the circular imprint of the staff she always carried. To my ten
year old eyes Mam’halia was the blackest person in the world. She was a small woman, with hair
river-stone white, and from her ears hung heavy beads and silver hoops, which stretched her lobes
by at least an inch. On her crooked fingers she wore big silver rings, and heavy bangles, some cop-
per, some gold on each wrist. Almost all her teeth were gold. No one knew how old she really was.
She said that as a child she had been one of the last slaves to come over from Africa and that she
was the first and only female to be born into her family for six generations. I was the only female
born since she.,.though that’s not what Mama said.

We lived together, Mam’halia, Mama and I, on land Mama had inherited. I spent lazy days play-
ing with the flowers and hard fruit of the huge Barringtonia or duppy coconut tree, as most people
called it, that grew right up against the front room of our house next to the porch. Some days I
would chase ground lizards over the large sloping backyard and load my lap with guineps, redcoat
plums and sweetsops until the day a rock had come flying at me from behind the cracked gravestone
of a long forgotten relative. Mama had to cut out a patch of my hair, all bloody and matted, and
apply white rum to the gash above my temple.

“Is duppy Mama? They don’t want me playing in the yard?”

“Shush chile, my relatives wouldn’t hurt you.”

But for a long time afterward I played only in the part of the yard where Mama could see me.

We saw Mam’halia mostly on weekends when Papa was home from cutting cane. He came up from
the plantation early Saturday mornings and left after dinner on Sundays. On Saturday evenings he sat
on the porch while Mam’halia squatted on the giant roots of the Barringtonia. They would sit in
silence until Mam’halia, puffing her cigar, the lighted end inside her mouth, would begin to speak.

“Grandnephew, yu nuh see mi staff? God vision me and I carve it out of wood from a tree like
this one we under, just like Him tell mi. Two snake twine-up together, them head a top and them
tail a bottom in a point. We come from a proud line; the fiercest tribe in Africa, but your woman
weaken yu. She and the unnatural looking pickney she have. It not right. Black people can’t have
white pickney, that’s why you nuh get nuh more, she blight the womb. And you don’t see how the
