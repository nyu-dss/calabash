I STIRRED AND FOUND MYSELF IN MAMA’S ARMS; nice and warm and safe. The fragrance of
the Barringtonia, through the open window curled around us in Mam‘halia’s bed. Half asleep I
heard her singing softly as she stroked my head.

“Everything alright now Hope. Your father will come home to stay and, when this little one born
it will live... just like you.”
