Two Guavas
VEGA BoA: ] Ae; PUERTO RIC CS

They rested in the car

scenting the drive to Ponce.
Two pale yellow fruits

plucked from the source:

the tree in my auntâ€™s garden
surrounded by orchids growing
out of coconut shells

and plantains hiding their tender fruit.
Nanda crushed the juicy pink
pulp with sugar and ice.

While we sipped the limber,

a bird sucked the nectar

of a guava from the tree.

That night, we slept

with their fragrance

ripening in the dark.
