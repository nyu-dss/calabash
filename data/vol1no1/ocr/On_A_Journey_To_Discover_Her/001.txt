On A Journey to Discover Her Caribbean Ingredient

Sipping sorrel

in Uncle Ashton’s shanty

munching Auntie Irene’s sweet cassava-pone
watching a brown boy chop a pillar of cane
finally, she studies the land

that cradled her people

like a mother nursing an infant,

and blessed them with immense pride

a finger taps her from the daydream

and points to the black and white photograph

of a mahogany girl

— a frightened stare from dark eyes

— thick plaits adorned with light colored ribbons
— a large tattered suitcase clutched by a small fist

“Your grandmother was a good woman.” Auntie Irene sings
in thick Bajan melody

about the sister she had not known

the one who had left for the mainland

and never returned

the one who had sent wrinkled U.S. dollars

to kin who remained

on the tiny Caribbean island.
