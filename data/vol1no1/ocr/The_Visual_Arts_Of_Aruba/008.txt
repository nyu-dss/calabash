Finally there are foreign artists, most of them from the Netherlands, who have migrated to the
region. They are often dazzled by a new nature and culture, and, as “converts,” they show in their
work sometimes a true Antillean mysticism and enthusiasm for their elected new world. Heleen
Cornet (1948), in Saba, a visual poet of the rain forest, illustrates this affirmation, as does Philippe
Zanolino (1960), from France, an installator and painter, who has elected Curacao as his second
“patrie.”

Finally, a gratifying sign of progress is the increasing number of women artists, among the best
and most advanced creators in their respective countries: Heleen Cornet (1945), Barbara Joyce
(1917) in Saba, Glenda Heyliger (1957), Alida Martinez (1964), Osaira Muyale (1964) in Aruba,
Lucia Trifan (1949) in St Martin, Barbara Lane (1946) in St Eustatius, Emily Francisca (1965), Ellen
Spijkstra (1957), Jeanne Girigori (1948), Norva Simon (1947) in Curacao. Nel Casimiri, Jennifer
Smit and Ruby Figaroa-Eckmeyer are contributing to present and future of art from Aruba and the
Netherlands Antilles, as curators and art historians.
