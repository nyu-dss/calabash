The Visual Arts of Aruba and the
Netherlands Antilles

INCE THE EARLY NINETEEN-EIGHTIES, Caribbean festivals and bienniales have been
S instrumental in breaking the insularity that has characterized Caribbean art. These events have
stimulated artists to share and exchange their work.

The Havana Biennial and the Biennial of Print in Puerto Rico were pioneers in bringing together
Caribbean artists. Similarly, the Caribbean and Central American Biennial of Painting, held in Santo
Domingo gave impetus to the development of the Caribbean arts. “Carifesta,” a cultural Caribbean
festival celebrated every two years in different islands, includes art shows and has done much to pro-
mote the visual arts of the region. Other important events have been organized in Guadeloupe and
Martinique. The Gala di Arte exhibition in 1991, the Carib Art exhibition in 1993, and the Arte’99
exhibition have been especially important for artists in Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. For, if
visual artists in the region as a whole have suffered from a lack of visibility, the artists in Aruba and
the Netherlands Antilles have suffered a double invisibility.

Speaking with artists from the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba,! one observes a certain pessimism
regarding art instruction, museums and opportunities for work. Curagao has no art academy where
one can receive a professional degree in studio art and art theory. Aruba offers only a part-time course
of study. The Foundation for the Arts organizes art classes and workshops in Saba. In St. Martin, art
education falls under the Department of Culture and art instruction is offered in the high school as
one of the subjects of the final examinations. Consequently, after completing training in the local
schools, art students from Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles pursue further art education in art
academies in the Netherlands or in universities in Latin American or the U.S.A.

There is no art museum in the Netherlands Antilles nor in Aruba. Exhibitions generally take place
in museums of other disciplines, convention centers, libraries, or private institutions and galleries.
There is some hope that a Museum of (Modern) Art may soon be founded in Curacao. This ten-year
long project gained the official support of the island authorities on the occasion of the last art exhi-
bition held in 1999.

Relative to the size and population of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles,? there exists, however,
