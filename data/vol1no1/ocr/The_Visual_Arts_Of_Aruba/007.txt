The proportion of artists in Arte’99 was more or less the same as it had been in Gala di Arte:
twenty eight artists from Curagao, seven from Aruba, three from Bonaire, two from St. Martin, two
ftom Saba, and seventeen artists from the Netherlands who had more than five years residence in
Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles, This exhibition reveals the evolution of the visual arts of Aruba
and the Netherlands Antilles of the last ten years: at Gala di Arte, there was just one installation. In
Arte’99 over half the works were installations, An enthusiastic international jury composed of the
art critics Maria Luisa Borras (Spain), Edward Sullivan (USA), and Marianne de Tolentino
(Dominican Republic) awarded prizes on the basis of originality, expression of Caribbean identity,
and quality of contemporary idiom. The installations received many prizes. Aruba scored very high
in relation to the number of participants. Arte’99 signaled that the fever of the visual arts in Aruba
and the Netherlands Antilles is indeed burning high!

Collectively, these three exhibitions have increased the visibility and recognition of the visual arts
of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. In addition, they challenge us to pay attention to the rich
artistic heritage and output from this almost “invisible face” of the Caribbean.

Artists

AS JENNIFER SMITH RIGHTLY POINT OUT, there is “an astonishingly broad and varied pre-
sentation of expressions of contemporary Dutch Antillean and Aruban art.” First, there are self-
taught or “intuitive” artists, to use the Jamaican art historian David Boxer's term. Among the most
famous of these are the painter Hipolito Ocalia (1916-1984)* and the sculptor Maximilliano
Nepomuceno (?-1975).

The second group are artists that have studied in the Netherlands, other European nations, the
United States, or Latin America. Although these artists may exhibit regularly in the Netherlands, they
have chosen their native land as their definitive domicile. These artists include Elis Juliana (1977),
Yubi Kirindongo (1946) and Jeanne Girigori (1948) in Curacao; in St. Martin, Ras Mosera; in Aruba,
the neo-abstract painter Ludwig de Lisle (1949), Elvis Lopez (1957) and the abstract-landscape
painter Stan Kuiperi (1954). In addition, connected to the Galeria Eterna are Osaira Muyale, Giolina,
and Renwick Heronimo who returned home to Aruba after their education abroad. Until the cre-
ation of local art academies, this trajectory will remain a most likely option.

The third group consists of artist who work and live elsewhere (mostly in the Netherlands or the
USA) though they come back regularly to the Caribbean. Among these are Jose Maria Capricorne,
Nelson Carrilho, Cynric Griffith, Rudy Martina, Sam Parabirsing, Roland Richardson, Felix de Rooy,
Myrna Ruiter, Norva Sling. They constitute a remarkable proportion of the exhibitors. Their work
— in theme and message— often celebrates the Caribbean landscape or the ancestral regional lega-

cies, be these Amerindian or African-Caribbean.
