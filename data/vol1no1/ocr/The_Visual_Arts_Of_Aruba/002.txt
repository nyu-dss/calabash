a rich network or art galleries. For example, Willemstad alone has six galleries. Patronized in large
part by tourists, these galleries offer handicrafts, souvenirs, maps and posters, in addition to original
works of art. This tourist-dominated patronage has challenged even such established galleries as
Eighty-Six in Curacao and the Studio Gallery in Aruba to maintain a balance between exhibitions
of serious contemporary art, including “rupture” art, and the sale of commercialized art.

In the past ten years, three regional events have been organized in Curacao with great success,
focusing attention on the visual arts of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles: Gala di Arte in 1991,
Carib Art in 1993, and Arte’99. All three exhibitions aspired to demonstrate the strength of the
visual arts of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. In each of the events, local leaders in the art field
assumed responsibility for organizing the exhibitions and were assisted by efficient collaborators.
Lectures, educational programs and other activities have accompanied these events.

In November 1991, Gala di Arte was the first exhibition of the visual arts from Aruba and the
Netherlands Antilles, revealing high level, original work that fused regional and international char-
acteristics. Included were ceramics, sculpture, painting, drawing, print, and one installation. Thirty-
eight of the artists came from Curacao, eight from Aruba, three from St. Martin, and one from
Bonaire. Maduro & Curiel Bank underwrote the cost of the entire exhibition, which also com-
memorated the bank’s 757 anniversary. One of the bank’s owners, May Henriquez, a painter her-
self, was instrumental in getting sponsorship for the exhibition. Henny Blok, director of Gallery
Eighty-Six, and Ruby Figueroa-Eckmeyer, currently the head of the General Secretariat of
UNESCO in Curacao, were the organizers of this exhibition.

Less than two years later, in August 1993, Carib Art was organized, financed by the National
Commission of UNESCO of the Netherlands Antilles. The coordinator Ruby Figueroa-Eckmeyer
and the project manager Frank Elstak faced the challenge of including artists of the entire Caribbean
region. Thirty-two countries were successfully represented. In addition, the exhibit was of vital
importance for artists from Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles in that it brought recognition to their
art and confirmed their acceptance—even of the tiny Saba and St. Eustatius—into the larger
Caribbean art community.

In 1999 Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire commemorated five hundred years of written history, On
October 23, the exhibition and competition Arte’99 celebrated “identidat ... ayera awe i majfian”
(identity: yesterday, today, tomorrow), in the beautifully renovated Mangansina di Arte. In this nine-
teenth century warehouse, property of the Maduro & Curiel Bank, the sponsors of the event, one
hundred works were exhibited, selected by a local jury from over three hundred submissions. This
large number of submissions indicates the fertility of the visual arts in Aruba and the Netherlands
Antilles. The curator of this exhibition was the art historian Jennifer Smit, who had the cooperation
of Nicole Henriquez, daughter of May Henriquez. The efficient staff of forty people included tech-

nicians and well-trained guides.
