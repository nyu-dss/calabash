on me so I can put my lips right on the smooth, tight muscle over his collarbone, under his ear. “You know what I'm
doing, I'm seeing you,” I say into his face. “For real though do you have anything to do? Do you have anywhere to
be?” And when I say, no, he grins the grin I work to get, and before his kiss ts over, he’s dragging me out the door.
“We going for a ride, yo...”

It’s not warm enough today, but as we're on the FDR riding up past the Water Club then the Roosevelt Island
Tram, we open up the sun roof and we turn up the music and Darling Nikki makes me laugh. And Leigh keeps
driving, through the Bronx and unto 195. “You not hungry babe, huh?” And I shrug and he screws up his face in
a double wink and says, “good, cause by the time we get there, you'll have a big ole appetite.” And 195 takes us past
Stamford and Bridgeport and some other ports and then Route 2a to another road and some smaller road with a
sign that tells me we're now in Rhode Island — the Ocean state. Have I ever been in Rhode Island before? And when
we swing into the gravel parking lot with the chunky white stones crunching under the tires, the sign that says
“Seaview Cove Diner” is painted on wood in white block letters below a faded red picture of a lobster. And when
we walk in, Leigh's Fubus hanging off him, his cornrows peeking out the back of my Trinidad bandana that he
claimed as a do rag the first night he stayed in Brooklyn, walk in with me trying to keep up pace in bootleg Iceberg

from Fulton Street, the joint notices, the customers quiet and the waitresses turn. “Let's do some eating babe,” Leigh
says smiling.

So we start with shrimp cocktails, extra lemon and Tabasco on the side. ‘And leave the menus right here for us,
we're gonna keep looking,” Leigh says. And he tells me about his new job and thanks me for helping with his resume.
Then we order Greek salads with stuffed grape leaves and lots of feta and end up feeding the last few olives to each
other. I don’t pay attention to the other customers; I dont ask him why he didnt call this week. And when I want to
have the boffo-bacon-burger, Leigh talks me into the surf ‘n’ turf. “We'll be having the same thing babe,” I try to
protest “we never get the same thing.” And he says “except for the coffee though.” And after he’s charmed the watt-
ress — ‘cause when you just meet Leigh, either he charms you or he scares you — he gets her to sit with us after the
diner empties out. Her name 1s Lola, a young grandma with a feathered pixte haircut, and she comes to New York
at least once a year to go shopping. They trade pictures of his kids and her grandkids. And she tells me that I cant
leave without having some of the apple pie a la mode ‘cause they order them from her good girlfriend who uses fresh
nutmeg “...and beside, you could use a little more meat on your bones...” and turns to Leigh with arched eyebrows
“... right?” So its two am and theyre closing when we leave and after the espresso for Leigh and the cappuccino for
me — on the house, cause “you've got a long drive and it’s late”. We pull out of the parking lot, from the gravel
unto the smooth pavement of Route 1 and Leigh is all trash talk, phone-sex talk, and I'm all soap opera tease as I
push my seat back and lick my lips; and by the time were on Route 78 I have my left hand on Leigh's thigh and his
right hand inside my belt. The moon roof is open and the light is soft on Leigh’ face.

The ambulance is square and hard inside. I watch the EMTs put Leigh on the stretcher, and I hear
them on the radio with the hospital. | wonder if the blanket they’ve put around my shoulders is
