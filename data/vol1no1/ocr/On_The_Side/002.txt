takes his order and they do their little regular-customer/special-waitress thing I can see him being
the little boy in the big Tims, and I can see her being charmed. She wears her hair in a short natural
like my mother’s friend Hyacinth who kissed me once in a dream in the back of a cab.

“So, you like them Trini women, eh?” I say to Leigh while we wait for the food. And he says, “T told you, she's
good people.” And after we start eating — he's got pancakes and scrambled eggs with cheese and a side of sausages
and I'm too hopped up to eat my cheeseburger, so I nibble at the fries — after we start eating, he tells me she reminds
him of Lester's mother. “But Lester’s Guyanese though,” I say. “No, he’s Trini too.” Leigh looks at me, I mean hes
been looking at me all night, but now he gives me the direct, full power look. “Can I share something with you?”
And he waits, not going forward as though the question is a preface, but waiting for an answer. “Can 1?” “Please,”
I nod. “Every man I've ever had in my life was from Trinidad.” “Really” I say, “guess once you go Trint, you never
want a Yankee.” And he screws his face up at my bad joke, but laughs anyway. And shares. Shares why he and Lester
broke up six months ago. Shares how close they had become: special because it was nothing special, ‘ya know; built
a home together in Jersey, bought stuff, cared for each other, met each other's family, men and women do it every day,
right? And I remember all those years ago when I had done all of that too, been part of the model gay couple, the
couple our friends told their friends about. And I remember how hard it was when I lost it too. “Tm glad I touched
you in the bar last night,” I say, because I don’t just want to tell him, “I know, I know.” But I give up on eating any
more, three quarter of the burger sits next to the red ketchup on the white plate. And when Leigh says “take a ride
uptown with me,” do I know that I'll let him take me to Harlem with him even though we're five blocks from my
studio? Take me to Harlem to the studio that he got when he had to leave the home he built with his man. Take me
uptown, and let him, and let him take me.

I wake up. There’s an ambulance behind us. It’s a big old ugly truck, square and hard, like an evil
transformer toy grown up. I am still cold. And the ambulance’s flashing lights are on, like big mon-
ster eyes spitting fire, blinking from dark to blinding red, back and forth, dark to red, red, dark to
red. And now an EMT is standing at the car, at Lester's car. Looking in the window at me and Leigh.
I hear his radio, crackling and squawking and when he shines a flashlight in, I see us now, the shat-
tered window, the hole where the windshield should be. “Sir, can you hear me,” he says, “sir.” “Yeah,”
I say, but it’s rough and garbled like “yghmp”. And when he plays the light in the car and waves it
around and over us, I see the glass everywhere — the dashboard is covered with it, and the hood
and inside too, it’s on me, on my legs, on Leigh, all over him. Not flat and sharp like splinters, but
rough and crumbly looking. Decorating everything like sprinkles on Mr. Frosty’s cone, because each
piece is picking up some light and flicking it back at my eyes with a different color: Detroit metal
green from the hood; FUBU blue from my jeans; white and yellow from the lights; dark red from
the Trini bandana; bright red. Shit bright red from my arm, from Leigh's face and arm and leg.
