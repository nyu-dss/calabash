On the Side

EIGH IS LYING ON ME. His legs are still on the passenger side, I guess, but I can’t see them
because that whole side is pushed in, mashed and crumpled into this tiny little space and there
really can’t be enough room, but his legs are there. I feel cold. I tell him, “Leigh, the cops are gonna
come and put flares down in the road.” I feel cold and sleepy. His waist is kinda on the gearshift box,
his chest is on my side, and his head is on my chest, warm against my chest. He’s wearing my ban-
dana with the Trinidad colors, and he’s so close to me, close to my mouth, close to my nose, that I
smell the espresso he had earlier. So, I tell him, and tell myself, “you know those little pink flares
they put on the road, real pretty right, little salmon stars. The other night when I was going home
I saw some a block away from me on Myrtle; they looked like party lights on the road, like lights
by a pool for a grand little pool party.” But it wasn’t a party, only an accident.

The cops are gonna come. And the ambulance. Then what? I’m so fucking sleepy. And cold. Then,

I tell him I haven’t been to Junior's in years. “That's it I’m coming by there tonight. We going.” When
we get there, Leigh grabs the red plastic handle on the big glass door and waits while I walk in out
of the drip-drip drizzle that’s been graying up the whole day. “After you, baby,” he says and gives
me his grin. We walk in and it’s bright inside: red, and red and white. And the cheesecakes are there
in a special counter by the door. Plain and pineapple and strawberry and blueberry, they're lined up
in the cases, from the little six inch ones to the big party size, ready to get boxed up in the red and
white candy striped bakery boxes. We pass red vinyl stools at the counter on the way to the hostess
stand. A middle-aged waitress with a red and white apron greets us and walks us past more red

columns to a booth in the back, a red booth in the back. “You're gonna like this waitress,” he tells

me. “She’s real cool, ya know, like a big sister or a moms ya know.” And when she comes back and
