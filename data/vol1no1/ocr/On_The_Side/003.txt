Bright, blood red from Leigh’s body. “Shit, help up. Look at him,” I say to the EMT. “Okay sir, okay.

We're going to take care of you.”

And the first time Leigh shows up in Lester's car instead of his, I should have known because he makes a point
of asking for “cds, not tapes” when we leave my apartment. But I was still grooving on how he looked, on how
good he looked. When he had called me that morning he was at the shop getting his hair braided. “You might like
it, I dont know,” he teased “it’s different from the way I always have it.” He abways has it back in cornrows, maybe
a dozen cornrows, neat from forehead to neck, sleek from temple to nape, They were like that when I first met him
five years ago — before Lester. When I met him at Sound Factory Bar, because that was the place back then. I
remember the attitude — tough and hard and scary. Hard when he stepped over to me, baggy denim overalls over
nothing but Tims; tough all the way when he walked with me to the coat check downstairs; scary, trying to be scary
when he moved me in the corner and got his face in mine. “Yo, dont forget to call me, okay? Okay? Leigh.” Then
he said it again, “Leigh”. And touched his lips to my lips in the dark corner. I remember. And when he shows up
tonight, I gotta groove on the look. “You got me cheesing, son” I pull him in the door. “You like it, like my hair?” 1
grin. “Do it fit my face and everything?” “Yeah,” I say, liking the small cornrows nwisted tight around many jagged
parts. Liking the hair and loving the Coveralls. Hes wearing Shawn John Coveralls — light brown. “Nice,” I think.
“Yeah, you look real nice,” I say. And I kiss him in the halhway.

The cops are here now, They came just as the EMT was getting me out of the car. Some cars slow
down to rubberneck as they go by. I'm doing my calm, crisis-management thing, but I know that it
won't last much longer, because it’s really a fake and I can’t remember what the EMT’s look like. I
need them to get Leigh out the car and take care of him. The cops sit me down on a kind of built
in bench in the back of the ambulance and I can tell that they're managing me, keeping the situa-
tion under control. They ask questions, but they’re not the ones I expect. They don’t ask, “where are
you coming from” or “what is your relationship” or “who’s his next of kin?” They’re filling in the
paperwork — date and time and last-name-first; they're keeping me away from the flat paddle-like
board and the oversized neck brace that the EMTs are using on Leigh.

The Downtown Brooklyn Diner should have been the last one. “What are you saying?” Leigh asks. “Huh, that
you dont want to do this?” I remember this place from years ago and though they ve renovated its still an ugly place.
Were here because theres too much traffic to go anywhere else, as hungry as we are. I dont answer him right away.
Can't. It’s Monday afternoon and I should not be sitting in this booth with a street sign that says Shore Parkway.
There’s a different sign at each booth. Cadman Plaza where the two uniformed cops sit all the way in the back.
Coney Island Avenue right bebind us where the Latino family sits with ovo small boys and a baby, keeping our votces
