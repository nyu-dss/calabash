down. I need to be finding a job and handling some business; too much time on my hands.

“Or, that you want to do this one more time then never see me again.” I stop thinking about everything he's said
so far; stop thinking about how I've fucked up ‘cause I'm finding out now about shit I should have asked about
before. Before I went uptown. Shit yes he and Lester broke up last October; yes, it was ugly and victous; yes, he has
his own place in Harlem. But also they see each other now. “What does that mean, exactly?” Lester spent tro nights
in Harlem last week...oh yeah, and Leigh spent three nights in Jersey. Yeah, and Saturday night when I saw Leigh
in the bar he had just left Jersey. And I’m thinking, “you can stop now, I've heard enough.” But yeah, “we were just
picking at each other so I said I'm going to move my car and take a little drive.” And yeah, when we were sitting in
the car outside the club and Leigh’s cell was ringing, um yeah, it was Lester. Yeah, “he wants us to get back together’.
“He wants?” Okay yeah, “we're talking ‘bout getting back”

So what am I saying? No, I don’t want to do this again. No, I want to do this one more time. No. I'm saying
that all I can do right now is finish my chicken gyro. I can make sure that I eat all the feta that’s making the bor-
ing greens on the plate; finish the grilled chicken and fried pita that are pretty good, because you cant go wrong with
grilled chicken. And if there're weren't all the “yeses” and “yeahs” and “nos” tossing around in my head, Id want a
wedge of lemon to take the chicken just there, Just there, like I was for a minute, for a hot minute on Saturday when
T thought I could take a shortcut, just there like on Sunday when I thought that youd make a great guide.

All, I'm saying is...” I look over and his plate is empty. What did he order? Can 1 tell what he had just by
looking at the empty plate? Is that gravy from the meatloaf, or barbecue sauce from the chicken wings? Was that
sticky looking place where mashed potatoes sat, or were they scrambled eggs? “... finish your coffee so we can get
out of here.”

But Brooklyn Diner wasn’t the last. After another, then another it became a joke, “where we gonna
go today son”, you asked the third time and the fourth, when you knew we'd end up at a diner again.
And after it was a joke it became a tradition. And it felt good, like knowing there’s gonna be pre-
sents under the Christmas tree. Then it became a contest, a challenge: “Man, we're going to a real
joint today, not like that weak-assed joint you picked last week.” Or, “Leigh wait till you see the
French toast they make here, it’s as thick as your arm and the color of a Trinidad sunset.” Then it
just was what we do. Grits and scrambled eggs at five in the morning after sweating in a club, or
chicken wings and fries when we woke up at two in the afternoon after he stayed in Brooklyn, or
burgers on wheat toast with mayo and tomato and no lettuce before a movie. And coffee for you,

always coffee for you. Tonight you had espresso at The Seaview Cove Diner.

“What are you doing tonight?” Leigh asks as soon as he walks into my apartment. And I grab him ltke I always
do when he walks in here, always — if he hasn't called in a week and I'm on that edge between jonesing and fury,
always - if he left twelve seconds ago and came back for his gum —I grab him and lean against the wall with him
