clean. And I think how nice it would be to be here alone with Leigh, just us looking across at the
hills in Jersey with the lights reflecting on the Hudson. And I think that we wouldn't be here if I'd
have let him walk past in the bar that night, or if I didn’t have such a heavy meal, maybe skipped
the apple pie. The cops finish the accident report. “No it’s not my car.” I show them my license and
they find the registration behind the sun visor. “Yes, my friend Lester knows I'm driving it.” It does-
n't show up as stolen and they finish the report.

T started to drive somewhere in Rye because by then Leigh was fighting with the big rigs on the road. After snaking
through ten miles of construction with concrete barricades inches from the car, Leigh's agitated, hes cussing and honk-
ing with each big rig we try to get by. I don't hesitate when he asks me if I want to drive. I don't even remember that
it’s Lester's Maxima; I don’t even say something about being glad he trusts me to drive him, he never lets anyone drive
him. And I think he’s calmer by the time we get back to the city. I'm driving down the West Side Highway and Leighs
on my right, then the Hudson, then New Jersey's hills. But when I pass the exit for 165" Street, he's pissed. “T'm not
going to your apartment, you know I'm not comfortable there,” And he's agitated again, “why we always got to go
through this?” And by the time we get to the 13.5 Street exit I'm not looking at hum, and I reach to turn the mustc
back on, ‘cause I’m not going to listen to him either and then there's his hand on the steering wheel turning tt to the
ramp and “what the fuck” I react without thinking, without thinking, holding onto the wheel, yanking it to the lefi.
Then. ..what? Then what? Then nothing ‘til the transformer ambulance, nothing ‘til the colors.

They wheel Leigh to the back of the ambulance, and the stretcher’s legs collapse into nothing
just like on ty. One EMT climbs in after us and the other slams the doors, one after the other. I'm
looking out the little square windows in the back of the truck, over Leigh with the oxygen tubes
and EMT working on him and I see Lester's car again. It’s crumpled up against the ramp, with glass
sprinkled around and the flares are flickering. I hear the siren start to scream and close my eyes with
that image as we pull off. ew
