What I Want

A night, dark and flecked
With stars and wind.

The humming rain.

The candle in a window.
Dirt roads where stories
Of mermammy come back
For love linger, where tales
Of spider’s spun truths
Simmer in the dust.
Rubied fruit glitter

In low-seeping trees.

The night’s voice sings
Like the sea, the rain, a bell.
