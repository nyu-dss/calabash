Visiting the Dead

My father woke up,

Shrugged off the soil

And headed for the garden.

A Ghost in a suit poking beans,
Prodding plantains and tomatoes.
He smiled, that rare twist

Of the lips, and patted

The bare edges of his sonsâ€™ graves.

They rested as he paced
Among the tubers.

Later that day it was sancocho
For supper, I peeled

And chopped the tubers, chanting
yuca, fiame, yautia, batata.

The fragrance of cilantro settled
over the vacant table.

How the one bottomless pot once
Served my father, my brothers
And the living. The heat

stroked my face as I leaned

over the green banana softening,

clinging to the roots.
