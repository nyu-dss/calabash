Calabash

here’s to men who would not see their women grieve
another day for children
ripped from arms
and lashed from wombs
men who would not see another brother quartered
refused to bring the shackles to hobble another's wings
the men who whispered the words of Oshun to their women making rivers run
caressing fingers
running waters, birthing water birthing rivers birthing passages middle passages
end passages the final passages
from enslavement
to emancipation
to independence

in memento mori
we wonder
why we must sacrifice
because freedom has never been a gift
to view a sunset on our own terms
so our children love themselves for just us or justice, not just so
so culture is not compromise
because freedom has never been a gift

because destiny demands it
apathy is the alternative
because freedom has never been a gift
if we don’t our children will curse our name (they do already)
if we don’t
we will anyway
die anyway
die

away
