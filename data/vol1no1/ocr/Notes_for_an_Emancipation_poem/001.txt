Notes for an Emancipation Poem

in memento mori

in remembrance of those who came before

who made the crossing

coming coming in the belly of vessels of greed

packed on shelves forced intimacies

anger fear uncertainty condolences repulsion hunger desperation
yearning shame fear anger

chanting prayers to orishas carried under their tongues

now they come like a righteous prayer embracing Yemanja
raising her up and reigning her on our heads

tears to salt to drink

from the first sunrise in June to the last setting

in the 11th month in the year of our lord

-lord

she pays tribute to her offspring/sprung from decks of despair
the sick the weak the economic excess

thrown into her waiting embrace

an answer to fevered prayers

then new prayers are uttered in the
Quatouba, the Bamboulay, the Ponum
busting chains with a shrug

wuking up freedom

in the grinding of hips

arms swaying, finger flicking flames in
flamboyant abandon

singing a Brim song

an be been a heaum buh massa been a hidum

in memento mori

we honor the mothers

who greased our hair with resistance

parting it hope and patience

braiding our story in royal rows

this for the women who kept

freedom warm between their thighs

nestled in their breast, shuddered behind lashes
nourished by a veil of tears
