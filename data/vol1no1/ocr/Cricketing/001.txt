FOR KAMAU BRATHWAITE

Bg
Cricketing

Those words were written under the stars
To the tune of crickets

That are voices of the stars

To the kisses of dew-fall

That are teardrops of the stars

So that,

If in this island yard

Where the very thistles grace stars
These words mean nothing at all
And my only accolade the wind â€”
Still that is exceptional ...

And with the tip of a pencil

So hungry for the dry gist of words
It skitters across the page

So edge of the teeth can be heard
Down this island road

Down this hard island road
Where darkness is coloured

By the excruciating composure
Of soft words

I will call out

My little black nothings

I will scrawl out

These little black nothings
Till they expose a nerve

And the stars cry out in silver shrieks
Everywhere dark grows
