Rachel E. Vernon

The Exile

This is not how
I dreamed it
This home
Away

From home

Is not

My home.

Imaginings of

Those who

Spoke

My true name

Warmed my dream
While Thomas coughed
And William raved.

I would survive.

I would return

To my people

Who would speak
The hidden language
Of my soul.

And now

In this place

I

No less a

Stranger

Than my English Kate.

My tongue
Cannot
Remember
The cadences
Of my youth.

Deke

My father
cannot hide
his hurt

at this

Black stranger

Needing
An interpreter
To greet him.

He has lost
His son
And I

My father.

Cabosher Cudjoâ€™s son
Is dead.

His African

Tongue, ways, dress
Crucified

At Islington.

His Easter form
Is Phillip Quaque,
Cleric

With no father

But God
And Englishmen.

They formed me
Into

This clerk
In holy Orders
This priest of

The Church of England.
