Stripper, or What’s In A Name

What did you say?

What job do you do?

I could not have heard right —
Repeat it, please do.

I am a stripper —
I told you,
Yes, that’s what I do,

I take pieces of wood,

I access the shape,

And decide what formation
That raw wood will take.

I get out my tools

And strip till I find

Exactly the image

I have in my mind.

Oh, I see, you're a craftsman,

You carve, is that true?

No ma’man,
I’m a stripper,
And that’s what I do.

I discard the dead wood,
I strip off each layer,

I strip it until

I like what I see there.
