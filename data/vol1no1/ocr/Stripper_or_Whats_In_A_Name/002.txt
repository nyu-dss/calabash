Calabash

Oh, right! You're an artist!
You create things, do you?

Please ma’man,
I’m a stripper,
And that’s what I do.

The satin smooth curves
Beneath the rough bark
Emerge when I strip —
As I said from the start.

Ah! A sculptor of wood

You are, in my view!
No ma'am,

I'm a stripper,
And that’s what I do.
