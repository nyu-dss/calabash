46 / Deanne Kennedy

Calabash

And ma’man, you could do
With some stripping yourself;
I would gladly remove

All those layers myself.

All those preconceptions,
Hypocrisy too,

I could strip away,

Thus revealing the truth.
But for you I think

I might need a sharp axe
To hack off the surplus
Before you face facts;
Before I expose

Your form pure and true,

Because I'm a stripper,
And that’s what I do.

I'll peel you,

Unsheathe you, denude every part,
I'll see for myself

What goes on in your heart.

Why dress up my job

In those terms to please you?
I said I'm a stripper,

And that’s what I do.
