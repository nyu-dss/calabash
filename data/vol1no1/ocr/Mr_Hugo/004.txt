ing herself with imaginings of the sexual clumsiness that men must encounter when they are dri-
ven to prefer their own kind.

But in the six months of his stay, so far, Mr. Hugo gives no reason for complaint. He remains
invisible except for the trail of habits that she comes to notice him by. He leaves extra money for his
keep and as though he can feel her pulse of anxiety, she observes that the amount that he leaves
grows in proportion to her need. She returns from work to find the garden weeded. The ready yams
and coco he will dig, wash them and leave them by the kitchen doorstep. A breadfruit will be roasted
sometimes. Dry coconuts will be husked and heaped. At first she is suspicious that some motivation
lies behind these habits. But months wear on with nothing sinister revealed. The numerous ways in
which these small services ease her life have caused in her a change of heart regarding Mr. Hugo's
occupancy. How to thank him now that her anger for Che for saying yes before she agrees has
slipped and poisoned any possible good relations between them? For from the start, by leaving his
food on a certain shelf in the kitchen safe, she has implied that he is unwelcome. Now she wishes
to tell him it is no longer so.

But the public’s anxiety unceasingly presses her to watch for certain things. Unmanliness is one.
He has taught her boys how to sweeten their mother's coffee, to scrub and darn their own jeans, to
starch and iron a shirt. Such skills in a man Che would openly disapprove of, if he ever stayed long
enough to notice. She shrugs off their father’s petty peeve for, certainly, a drinking, gambling, wom-
anizing man doesn’t dare uphold himself as an example of the ideal. But secretly she doesn’t know
if she should feel ashamed that these occupations, while building competence and independence in
her boys, bring to her a mother’s undeserved relief. Watch out for a queerness in behavior! Some oddity,
Expect! Unseemly advances, Beware! In bits of awkward conversation as best as she can manage telling
a nine and eleven year old, she takes precaution to warn them. We know. We know. They give a hur-
ried embarrassed laugh. For children prefer to know from other children the secrets of Mr. Hugo, as
they already know.

With the village's unflinching eye pinned on a man like that, Bernadette doesn’t need a spy to tell
her how Mr. Hugo spends his days. She catches him when he wakes at five, roasting, grinding, brew-
ing fresh coffee daily. Then he leaves. Since the burning down of his shoemaker’s stall, his home
and his business, she has heard that he hires himself out as morning laborer on estates, cane-fields,
oil-fields, working hard to reclaim his loss. Then he returns to Bernadette’s kitchen chamber to take
a nap. In the early afternoon he is often seen seated on a three-legged stool, his restless hands reach-
ing for a familiar occupation. His tools are scattered on a bench beside him, a knife, a mallet and a
pan of nails. His fingers deftly smooths and stretches the leather uppers over a wooden last to meet
an outer sole, a boy’s size six. And for yards around people can hear the regular doleful hammering
of the shoe maker.

Bernadette’s boys say, Mammie, de man is strange. He finds them wherever they are and drags them
