Mr. Hugo

R. HUGO IS A HOMOSEXUAL, PEOPLE SAY, and beneath their breaths, they call him
M names because it is important that their judgement speak. What else can he be, this forty-four
year old bachelor if he has never had a woman. Confirmation that it is so comes from good author-
ity. Mr. Jacobs, the postmaster, has testified that Mr. Hugo once approached him sexually, said he told
him off properly for such nastiness. While Mr. Jacobs’ motivations for this accusation has become
suspect, after it was found out that he himself was undeniably a homosexual, caught in the act, why
should people bother to revise their belief about Mr. Hugo when he does not deny that it is true.
He is lucky that the thing that saves him from scorn is that he is a gentleman, generous, discreet.

In these parts, dry seasons have been known to wreak vicious and indiscriminate havoc, when the
midday sun toasts the grass crisp and brown, when it cracks and crumbles the bare earth to dust as
the temperature climbs and sizzles the air above ground. Conditions like these will easily ignite the
leaf trash. A breeze will fan a spark till it blazes and flies with the wind. Hillsides, cane-fields, forests
might be obliterated, go up into deep smoky black clouds of soot that are seen drifting across fields
and houses, that sit on mountain tops or suspend menacingly over the horizon. While beneath the
crackling and burning unceased encroaches on villages, razes houses ashes to the ground. Mr. Hugo
has lost his house and possessions in such a fire. He is pitied for his loss, but has no place to go
because nobody wants him.

It is not unusual that Che would want to offer Mr. Hugo lodgings. He is in the habit of bringing
home strays. And, after all, Mr. Hugo has frequently delivered him from rumshops and revived him
out of his alcoholic comas. Bernadette knows. She never minds giving any one a plate of food or
shelter for the night, but she prefers to keep her little sanctuary for family and children. This time
Che isn't bringing home any transient. He is talking about installing Mr. Hugo in the match-box
room adjoining the kitchen. A permanent arrangement of board and lodging is a matter to think
about, discuss, Che forgets that he should wait for her answer. He realizes his mistake too late to
retract the words that come galloping out of his mouth, “I tell him yes aready.”

“He'll pay rent,” Che attempts to mollify his woman lurking behind an ugly dead-eyed mask, “De
money is all yours. Why not try it out for a little while.” And people will talk, Bernadette knows,
whether you do or you don’t take in a homosexual into your house, so she might not have argued
