out of idling. They complain. He assigns them various chores about the house and yard, mopping
floors, cutting grass and feeding fowls. Not satisfied with that, he sits them down at a kitchen table,
presents them with a copybook and shows them how to form and practice their letters. They must
recite the times tables twice and study a rhyme. While, at nights, Bernadette sees a lantern burning
by the window in the chamber where the shoemaker sits on the edge of his bed. He sits there smok-
ing. His fingers needing exercise, with waxen thread and hog’s bristles, he stitches upper leathers to
their inner soles.

Days unravel leaving Bernadette with a bittersweet pleasure for the presence of Mr. Hugo. The
regular presence of a man is pleasing—a sober, useful man, more so. Though they hardly speak, she
grows accustomed to the habit of his being there till, unconsciously, she depends on it. The tenant
makes such a difference in her life, so sweetens her sufferance of loneliness and abandonment that
she is frightened to think what she will do without him. The more of the man disclosed to her by
his deed, the more he appears to her in quite a normal light. She is willing to dismiss all this homo-
sexual business as a lie, to forget that it might be true .

Having retired from his toil, on evenings, Mr Hugo settles himself on a chair, smoking before an
open casement window in his chamber of the detached kitchen hut. It is already dark at six o'clock.
He has been sitting there well into the night till, now, the wee hours of morning, An oil lamp hangs
from a nail of the low ceiling above him and burns, silvering a patch of blackness clinging to the
window.

In the main house, Bernadette is seized by an unexplainable restlessness, tormenting her sleep,
despite her fatigue. She's abandoned yet again. From time to time she rises and paces the floor, paus-
ing to look out of her window and gaze at the long ethereal curls of tobacco smoke lifting and dis-
appearing into the silvery veil.

Months of his thoughtfulness and generosity ever since Mr Hugo’s occupation in her dwelling
begins mellowing her resentment for the man, displacing it with tenderness, For so long she has been
used to obligation tugging her out of bed that she is disquieted by an exultant feeling of being lured
into wakefulness by the rhythmic pounding of the mortar in her yard by a tight muscled, half-naked
man, accompanied by the aromatic burst of roasted coffee beans. She has been trained to expect that
little joys will punctuate life’s hardships, but to be wary of the dangers of abundant joy, and to
remember, above all, only God can bring peace of mind. She cautions herself not to be too happy
in that abundant joy she feels in having a man around the house once again. Still, she would like to
shout it to the villagers that she is confirmed that Mr. Hugo is one hundred times more than the half-
a-man he is rumored to be.

The night is torrid. Her throat is parched. By the way she is drinking a fever is coming on.
Bernadette raises her cup from the side of her bed to her mouth and drains it empty. There is a water

barrel in the kitchen with a galvanize spout leading from the roof-top where it catches the rain that
