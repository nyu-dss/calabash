Calabash

trickles down. She will wrap herself in a shift, wear a scarf to shelter the dew. She tiptoes out the
door, not to wake the children. The wooden steps creak from her weight on her right foot as she
stuffs the left in the old boot on the step where it lies. Her hand with the flash-light shivers. Outside
a breeze cools the heat on her skin. It doesn’t soothe her throat. She must be ill.

The shoemaker in the antechamber of the kitchen is alert to alien sounds. Bernadette enters. He
is punctual to greet intruders by the parted curtain that leads to his retreat. A short distance between
them, the figures stand rigid, each calculating the other in silence, in the subdued light.

Bernadette is swept up by a sudden passion. Not a fever, but passion races through her and burns
her fingertips. Her blood runs cold right down to her toes. Passion coursing through her like waves
of fever, hot and cold, she does not remember, in this moment, that it was some similar conflagra-
tion that once melded her to Che. It és a devil's weakness that wills it, she thinks, she can will it away. But
any item of consequence that might latch her restraint in place breaks loose, floats weightless in her
mind; He is no ordinary man. He might reject her for his own sex. No matter.

For now, the insurmountable yearning has crescendoed far too close to its climax to recede. She
notes with some relief that the atmosphere is spelled by animal heat coming from both sides of the
toom. And in the ensuing suspension of time, where bodies might collide, they drift together. Their
skins softly melt in the way that seams disappear under the thumbing of a sculptor’s gentle touch,
unifying distinctions, making them whole. In the midst of sweet embrace, through his clothes her
hands are tracing of their own accord, the contours of his rear, the hollows of his back and the
stiffness of his manhood. She is convinced that this Mr. Hugo is no homosexual at all.

And suddenly, before the abating of her desire, before her mind distends, condemns, with aware-
ness of the outrageous act she is committing, she senses a sudden tension in Mr. Hugo that singes
her desire. He straightens his posture, kisses each of her palms and folds them like a treasure against
her bosom. Then an index finger sweetened by a kiss he plants gently upon her lips, “SH!” He whis-
pets in a broken voice, “You are my first and only love, but you're not mine to have.” With that Mr.
Hugo turns and leaves the room. She feels a greater wrenching by his leaving than the abomination
she ought to feel for having violated her vow to Che, in the sight of God. ?&
