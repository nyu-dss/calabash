many times over. He picks himself up and his voice again, after a pause, “I borrow dat money from
you to invest in a boat. Fluff, mey own boat. Yuh know what dat means, more of everything for you
and de chirren. Is a wicked fate dat bandits jump me before I clench de deal. Is a miracle I still alive
today.” Reliable sources have told Bernadette that her money went to pay a gambling debt. A for-
midable opponent Che had butt ends with that time, who, if he didn’t have his money would surely
have had Che’s head.

In the first performances of this drama, Bernadette is moved by veins of truth marbled into a ball
of lies. But it’s a familiar scene played out too many times to sustain its intended effect. In his own
way, she knows, Che cares for his family. But his way is capricious and uncertain, as shifting as the
sand beneath the tides. It is nothing she can count upon. For years she is satisfied to wear his love
like a borrowed cloak, allowing herself to enjoy a fleeting warmth and security. This pan incident is
a persistent obstacle between them. Each time it resurfaces, she hopes that he will own his guilt,
show remorse. She might forgive him. But it is one too many lies mounting upon the initial lie that
makes her snap. Seized by a convulsing rage, she belches out,

“Che, you're the biggest tief I know. But dat eh ha notting to do with Mr. Hugo coming here. Over
my dead body I will let you taint up me chirren and make my house into some Sodom and
Gomorrah.” Her own words alarm her, distort other sentiments she feels, but she cannot check the
outpour of a bottled rage. Che is shocked. He always knows exactly what to tell a woman. Bernadette
has been his special study. But this radical change he discovers in his woman, can it be? When words
come back to him, they fall spontaneously, with no particular aim or destination this time,

“Bernadette, | thought yuh was different. I thought anyone wit charity would be you. I thought
yuh was above judging and all dat.” His voice and his body shrink, as he concedes his loss. But quite
unintentionally, though he could not beforehand have guessed at the measure of its success, he
strikes a lethal blow on his behalf, for Bernadette is slapped into shame by the plain truth in what
he has said.

Bernadette tacitly agrees for Mr. Hugo to stay; she wants no part of him. “Make sure he keeps to
himself,” she insists. She lives with the everyday whisperings that a condition like Mr. Hugo’s is some-
thing to beware of, distrust. It being some aberration of the normal and good, she should worry for
her sons, for evil is invasive, quietly insinuates itself, then dominates. It is squandering words appeal-
ing to fixed minds, so she doesn’t say what she believes, that evil lies not in them who cannot help
themselves for being born so. And who in his right mind chooses eternal damnation and scorn is either
an innocent or a fool; just as scorners of the black, yellow and maimed, the innocent and the fool
should be shamed. But there is wisdom in precaution, which Bernadette takes, for such singular rea-
soning is a feather against the crippling weight of popular prejudice. Under which , she succumbs.

She stays alert, watches for Mr. Hugo to slip up and betray himself. Perhaps he will bring a lover
into the house, she will have to turn him out. Not once, several times she blushes in shame, catch-
