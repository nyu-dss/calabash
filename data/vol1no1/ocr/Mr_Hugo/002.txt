against the idea if those words, J tell him yes aready, didn’t jab her so, as if she has no say in the mat-
ter at all. She is aware that such acute vexation cannot be contained in these words alone. It proceeds
from a greater source of aggravation ever since Che stole the money from the pan. The anger that
she feels glances off the surface of those words and plunges through the layers of infractions Che
has committed against the children and herself, each and every one of them unconsciously mea-
sured, piled and compacted over years.

“I radder starve dan bring any sinfulness in dis house.” She is astonished by the vehemence in her
voice. To him her response is irrational, inconsistent with the woman he has married. There used to
be a time when, “Bernie my Fluff,” were all the words needed to melt her down like warm butter.
No more! His Bernie was a different woman now, It shames him that she has grown to be more than
he is man enough to match. Still, like white on rice, she cannot betray her true nature. He knows
her well enough to know that this response has less to do with how she feels about Mr. Hugo's sex-
uality than with him. It's about the money in the pan business that she will never forgive. His blotchy
mind recalls the incident only vaguely. But the severity of his wife's behavior since confirms his cul-
pability, impresses upon him the gravity of his offense. Details of truth when remembered by her
are so unpalatable to his conscience, the way she sums it up, What kin o' man will tief food from he own
chirren mout? will make him do anything to erase the incident from his past. He has tried in vain to
redeem himself, miscalculating recurrently that the simple truth will do. He longs to give the matter
eternal rest, but now he welcomes a re-opening of the old sore, any detour to detract attention from
his present predicament concerning Mr. Hugo. Damned that slip of the tongue he has blundered
already, for saying yes without first consulting Bernie. He stalls, bracing himself to handle the stub-
bornness of his wife. When a man says “yes” he must stand on his word. He has his pride to think
about and Che believes that in games with women, he cannot play fair if he is to win. As he did
back then, he falters on the lie he tells again. And, as with the best of lies, he has come to believe it
himself,

“Fluff, if I tell yuh once I tell yuh a hundred times, me eh tief no money. It was a loan.”

“Is so? If yuh call borrowing without asking, what dey call tiefing?”

“Bernie, O Gawd yuh know if I did ask yuh I wasn’t getting a fardding. Tell me yuh wouldn't o'
say I was using it to go drink and gamble?”

“Ask and it shall be given, de Mighty One say. And you eh shame? Tell me, how much times yuh
ask and get and squander it all away.”

“Yuh tink I de borrow dat money for me? Is for you and de chirren.” His plea to be believed
pitches and fractures his voice. “Lord, woman,” he bawls, holding his head in his hands, bowing,
“what I go do to make yuh believe notting more important in de worl to me dan you and de chirren.”
Tears stream from his red eyes, his fat lips tremble and glisten with a slimy dribble that wets his limbs

hanging low and limp. For her to watch a grown man bawl is wrenching, no matter she has seen it
