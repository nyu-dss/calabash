Re
An Attractive Middle-Aged Woman Dines Out

She drinks the wine in deep swallows
Over shallow toasts to men whose eyes reflect

That better days have been spent elsewhere.

Her sparkling laughter seems overdone

As if prepared the night before.

These are lean times, with little joy to savor.
Where are the connoisseurs to appreciate
The delicacy of middle-age,
To satisfy the taste for something fruitful?

Just when the appetite is greatest,

There isnâ€™t much left on the menu.
