FATHER SWABY
What a shame what?

JOSEPHS
That a fine looking Jamaican girl like that can’t sing a rukun bine or a nice

calypso or whatever, instead of some white man’s song.

FATHER SWABY
And what’s wrong with a white man’s song? Doesn't he have just as much

right to write a song as anyone else?

JOSEPHS
Oh I don't say he don’t have a right to write it. It’s just a shame she have
to sing it.
FATHER SWABY
Why is it a shame? If it’s a good song, then why shouldn’t she sing it?

MOTHER SWABY

(Starting off a little strong for her, and then getting quiet at “dear.”)
When did you get so pro-British, dear?

FATHER SWABY
I’m not pro-British!

JOSEPHS
You sure don’t sound like it.

TREVOR
You mustn’t be too hard on father, Mr. Josephs. He tries to hate the

Englishman, but he just can’t quite manage it.

JOSEPHS
Yes, I know what you mean. It’s a pity too when you come right down to

it, because he’s such a fine, upstanding Jamaican man, all in all.

FATHER SWABY

(To Josephs.)
Why are you talking to him about it? He’s the worst black Englishman

alive. All day long he sits up there in that college and lectures on
Shakespeare and Goldsmith and Sheridan and the rest of that rotten lot. I
spend all my time trying to make him realize he was born in Kingston, not
Stratford on Avon.

JOSEPHS
Shame on you. You shouldn’t talk about your own flesh and blood like that.
