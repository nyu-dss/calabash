CYNTHIA
The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra, la,
Bring promise of merry sunshine,
As we gaily dance and we sing, tra la
Of flowers that bloom in the spring.
And that’s what we mean when we say or we sing
Tra, la, la, la, la, la tra, la, la, la, la, lah.
(Then she disappears down the steps and past the front lawn, stage right.)
MOTHER SWABY
Dinner will be served promptly at seven, dear. Mind you're back by then.

CYNTHIA
(She's heard “tra, la, la, la, Ia ing” as she goes off, doing it almost as in a response.)
JOSEPHS
What a fine voice she has.

FATHER SWABY

(Sulking.)
How do you know she’s got a fine voice?
JOSEPHS
I just heard her, didn’t I?
TREVOR
She’s practicing, actually.
JOSEPHS

What for?

FATHER SWABY
What difference does it make?

MOTHER SWABY
Oh, Mr. Swaby, you're such a tease. She’s in the pantomime. They're doing
The Mikado from Gilbert & Sullivan. Isn’t it wonderful.

JOSEPHS
And that’s one of the songs she’s going to sing?

MOTHER SWABY
Yes.

JOSEPHS
What a shame.
