But stop. First you throw good, good rum, what you ask fuh, on your roses...

FATHER SWABY
What the hell business is it of yours what I throw on my roses.

JOSEPHS

(Continuing)
Then you get your darling wife to give you more rum, and you swallow

that down like is water. Bad for your liver if you drink too fast you know,

old man.

FATHER SWABY
(Apoplectic)

I don’t give a rass about my liver!

MOTHER SWABY
But you should, dear, you should.

TREVOR
Well, cheers.
JOSEPHS
Cheers!
MOTHER SWABY
(She takes a drink too.)
Cheers!

FATHER SWABY
And since when did you start drinking in public?

MOTHER SWABY
Oh, it’s all right, dear. Mr. Josephs is like one of the family.

FATHER SWABY
(Spitting out a fresh drink.)
What! What! Wha, wha...wha

(He starts stuttering.)
TREVOR
Careful, father, you'll get apoplectic.

FATHER SWABY
I am apoplectic!
