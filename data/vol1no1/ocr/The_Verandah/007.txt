No, from Hawaii. Of course from England. Where else?

TREVOR
(Without looking up)

They beat Australia again. Means they’ve kept the Ashes.

FATHER SWABY
Phhh. They'd never play us.

TREVOR

Even if they did, they’d never play you for the Ashes.

FATHER SWABY

Of course not, because they know we'd give them a proper thrashing.

TREVOR

With your weekend cricketers against their professionals who do nothing

else seven days a week but play cricket and have been playing it against

world class competition for as long as there’s been a game to play, since

they invented it.

FATHER SWABY

So what! I could lick the whole lot with half a team of good Jamaicans.

TREVOR

Oh you mean if a man is black he’s twice as good as anyone else.

FATHER SWABY
Anyone!

TREVOR
Especially an Englishman.

FATHER SWABY
Especially!
(Gloria comes out with fresh tea.)

FATHER SWABY
Where’s my rum?

GLORIA
Mrs. Swaby bringing it, sar.

FATHER SWABY
Well see that she does and hurry up about it.
