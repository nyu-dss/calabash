Oh. Then I better bring him another rum ‘fore him start sneezing.

MOTHER SWABY
Oh I don’t think so, ADC. It’s not chilly this evening. Why don’t you just
go back to your room and lie down a bit if you're tired.

ADC
But I’m not tired.
(Straightens up to prove tt.)
MOTHER SWABY
Then you can get your supper from cook if you want to.

ADC
What! Eat before he does. I would never do that.

MOTHER SWABY
Well, you don’t have to stand there as if you're at attention.

ADC
Yes, I do.
MOTHER SWABY
Why?
ADC
(He edges towards her.)

Him! I can’t leave you alone with him.

MOTHER SWABY
But Mr. Josephs is our neighbor. He’s a friend of the family.

ADC
I thought the MacPhersons were our neighbors.

MOTHER SWABY
That’s to the left.

JOSEPHS
I'm to the right.

ADC
I thought that place was empty.

MOTHER SWABY
