MOTHER SWABY
Have another drink, dear.

FATHER SWABY
You go to hell, the lot of you. Just go to hell!
(He gets up and stalks into the garden and begins watering hts lawn.)
TREVOR
He loves to water his own garden. The gardener boy can do everything else,
but father won't let him water the garden.

MOTHER SWABY
(She sits beside Mr_ Josephs.)
Have another drink, Mr. Josephs.
JOSEPHS
Don’t mind if I do.

MOTHER SWABY
And you, Trevor?

TREVOR
Why not?

MOTHER SWABY
And one for me.
(They all drink again.)
JOSEPHS

(After a slight pause.)
Where's your other son, Mistress Swaby, the one that’s really yours. I

haven't seen him around lately.

MOTHER SWABY
Oh you mustn’t say that, Mr. Josephs. Trevor is as dear to me as if he were
my very own.
JOSEPHS
Oh I have nothing against Trevor. He’s a fine young man. Very upstanding
and well educated. A credit to you and to everyone. But there’s nothing like
your own you know, Mrs. Swaby. Your own should come first. Blood before

anything else I always say.

TREVOR
And what about me? My blood’s dead. At least half of it is. The other half

is watering the lawn. And Cynthia and Bertie are just that, only half blood.
