ADC
That's not a long time, six months.

JOSEPHS
I guess not, mastah, not to you anyway.

ADC
But stop. You're out of order calling me Mastah. There’s only one man can

call me mastah, and that is my mastah. And you are not he.

JOSEPHS
Beg your pardon!

ADC
You don’t have to beg my pardon about anything.

MOTHER SWABY
Now, now, ADC, that’s enough.
(Mrs. Johnson comes out.)

MOTHER SWABY
Why Mistress Johnson, I see Gloria woke you up.

MRS. JOHNSON
She did not. She’s been upstairs in your son’s room ever since she went in.

People think I don’t know what goes on, but I do. I may be old, but I’m no
fool.

MOTHER SWABY

(Looking out.)
Now where are Trevor and Monica going off to? They’re turning out of

the gate. I thought he said he was just going to meet her.

JOSEPHS
They probably want to be alone for just a little while. When two people are
in love, Mistress Swaby, the most important thing in the whole world is to

be alone together. Can you understand that?

MRS. JOHNSON
Oh, she understands it all right. Dirty gal. Never could keep her away from

the men. I don’t know why Swaby married you in the first place. He knew
you weren't a virgin. Everybody knew it. You didn’t fool him, you dirty lit-
tle slut.

MOTHER SWABY
Yes, Mistress Johnson, It’s a chill. Why don’t you go in and get a shawl.
