SCENE I
SUNDAY EVENING BEFORE DUSK

(18% Lady Musgrave Road on the Liguanea Plain in St. Andrew. TREVOR is sitting
on the front verandah reading the newspaper and drinking tea. GLORIA comes out in
cap and apron and pours some more for him and adds milk and sugar and leaves before
he looks up or says anything. He turns the page and folds it out continuing a story from
page one. FATHER SWABY comes out with bis scissors and gloves and watering can.
He eyes Trevor closely, smells the tea in the pot and makes a deprecating sound.)

FATHER SWABY
Humph. Orange pekoe, bought from the Chinaman.

TREVOR
I drink what they give me.

FATHER SWABY
I happen to grow the best mint in St. Andrew. Why for heaven's sake won't
you drink that instead of this lye.

TREVOR
I drink what they give me.
(He takes a sip, still reading )
FATHER SWABY

(He goes to the edge of the verandah, right, and pulls a leaf of mint from his potted
plant.)

Here, smell this. Just smell it.

TREVOR

(He stops reading to smell it.)
Excellent aroma, but I couldn’t possibly drink it.

FATHER SWABY
And why not?

TREVOR
Because of the milk.

FATHER SWABY
What has the milk got to do with it?

TREVOR
Everything. You see, your mint is all well and good by itself. But mix it with
milk and what have you got? An absolutely insipid concoction.

FATHER SWABY
So don’t mix it with milk.
