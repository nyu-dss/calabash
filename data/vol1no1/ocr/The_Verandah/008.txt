GLORIA
Yes, sar,
(She exits.)
TREVOR

Aren't you worried, really. Don’t forget, your father died of cirrhosis of the

liver.

FATHER SWABY
That's a lie. My father died while he was humping the maid.

TREVOR
He did not.

FATHER SWABY
He did so. Were you there?

TREVOR

Don't tell me you were.

FATHER SWABY
Anyway, it doesn’t matter how he died.

TREVOR
Suppose he’d died a hero, wouldn’t that have mattered?

FATHER SWABY
Any poor slob can die a hero. What does it take to show off for a few min-
utes? nothing. If you're dying anyway you know damn well you won't
have to do it for long, so any bastard can pull it off. But show me a man
who can do it who doesn’t have to, who’s full of life and in his prime, with
everything to lose. Now that bastard is brave because he doesn’t want to
die. And for him, even if it is heroic, it’s a complete loss. And that makes

him a sucker for even trying.

TREVOR
There’s a stillness at Appomattox.

FATHER SWABY
Why?

TREVOR
I don’t know why.

FATHER SWABY
What the hell are you talking about?
