TREVOR
Appomattox, in America. It's where Lee surrendered to Grant after he’d lost
the Civil War.

FATHER SWABY
What do you know about America?

TREVOR
Nothing really, but it seems like a fascinating country.

FATHER SWABY
Well it isn’t, take my word for it.

TREVOR
When they call a black man a Negro in America, do they mean any black

man or only a black black man.

FATHER SWABY
They don’t know what they mean.

TREVOR
Oh, oh. Here comes Josephs.

FATHER SWABY
What the hell does that bastard want.

TREVOR
I don’t know, but if you're going to have a row, I'll go for a walk.

FATHER SWABY
No, stay for god’s sake. That’s the only thing that will keep me from stab-
bing him with the garden shears.
(JOSEPHS comes up onto the verandah from the front, stage right.)

FATHER SWABY
My dear Josephs, how are you?
(Big smile.)
JOSEPHS

What a way some a we can sound English though. “My dear Josephs, how
are you?” I'm fine my deah Swaby, and how are you? And you, my deah
Trevor? Fine you say, then I say I’m glad to hear it, my dear boy, and I'm
fine too,

(Pretends to have a mustache, which he twirls as he continues.)
JOSEPHS
And now that we're all fine, I say that’s jolly good, jolly good.
