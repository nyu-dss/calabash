(As she picks up the pot, Father Swaby comes back up from the garden.)

FATHER SWABY
Let the servants do the fetching and carrying for god’s sake. That’s what
they’re for! You can take a bitch out of the country, but you can’t take the
country out of the bitch.

MOTHER SWABY
Yes, dear, of course. Any tea for you?

FATHER SWABY
No. Rum and water, No ice.

MOTHER SWABY
The way you always take it.

FATHER SWABY
Yes.

TREVOR
But I thought Sealey said you weren’t to drink.

MOTHER SWABY
Oh he isn’t to, but your father’s lived this long in spite of the doctor, so
there’s no reason why he shouldn't continue until it kills him. You must
remember your father’s done his living, all of it. He’s been a war hero, a
sports hero, an American adventurer, a colonial student in London, and a

successful lawyer. He’s seen it all and he’s done it all.

FATHER SWABY
(Settling himself down.)
Including the women. I’ve done them too. Don’t forget that.

MOTHER SWABY
Oh yes. There’ve been so many of them, so very, very many. And now that
the women and the wars and the adventure are all gone, there’s nothing left.
Nothing except the rum and maybe the dying.

(She takes up the tea pot again.)
Since I’m going in anyway, I might just as well take the tea.

(She exits.)
FATHER SWABY
Well, what’re the cricket scores?

TREVOR
From England?
