MOTHER SWABY

TREVOR

MONICA

Good evening everybody.

MOTHER SWABY
Good evening, my dear. Enjoy your walk?

MONICA
Yes, but I would have enjoyed it more if it had been longer.

MRS. JOHNSON

MOTHER SWABY

TREVOR
He wouldn’t talk to me when I passed him either time. Seems as if he

JOSEPHS
Sorry about that, son. You want me to go talk to him.
