TREVOR
The weather warm, the food ‘nough and the rum hot.

JOSEPHS
Yes.

MOTHER SWABY
Come in, Mr. Josephs, please!

MRS. JOHNSON
You'd better watch out. It could be his last supper.

(She cackles.)

FATHER SWABY

(He comes up.)
Well, that’s that. Are we all ready?

MOTHER SWABY
Yes, dear. We've been trying to get Mr. Josephs to join us for dinner.

FATHER SWABY
Where’s Cynthia? Didn't you tell her not to dally.

TREVOR
Here she comes.

FATHER SWABY
ADC!

ADC

(He snaps to attention.)
Sar!

FATHER SWABY
Get me another pair of shoes. These are soaking wet.

ADC
Then I'm relieved of duty?

FATHER SWABY
What the hell are you talking about?

MOTHER SWABY
Nothing, dear. Yes, ADC, you're relieved.

ADC
Hu, faaace. Hup, two. HUP!
(He exits marching.)
