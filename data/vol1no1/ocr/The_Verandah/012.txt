to start all over again. What you say to that, Brother Swaby.

FATHER SWABY
Don’t brother me. I’m not one of your brothers.

JOSEPHS
I know that. I just wanted to make sure you know it.

(Mother Swaby comes on with rum and glasses on a tray.)

FATHER SWABY
Well, it’s about time.

JOSEPHS
Hello, Mistress Swaby.

MOTHER SWABY
Hello, Mr. Josephs. I heard your voice so I bought an extra glass. I know
Mr. Swaby doesn't like to drink alone.

FATHER SWABY
That’s a damn lie. When have you ever heard me say that I didn’t like to
drink alone, when? I love to drink alone. I just love it.

TREVOR
No, you don't. You're always drinking with the MacPhersons.

FATHER SWABY
What the hell have they got to do with it?

JOSEPHS
Is all right. If him don’t want me to have a drink from him bottle, I can do

without. I have plenty bottle at home.

MOTHER SWABY
Oh you mustn’t take Mr. Swaby seriously, Mr. Josephs. That’s just his way.

He doesn’t really mean anything by it.

FATHER SWABY
Who says I don’t mean anything by it. Who? What’s the matter around

here? Can't I talk for myself. Don’t I have a mouth and a tongue? Well,
don’t I?
MOTHER SWABY

(She has poured two drinks and added water to Father Swaby’s during this.)
Yes, dear.
