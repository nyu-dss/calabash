And do they let you come in through the front door when you want to get

any of it, or do you have to go around the back and pass a bag through the
window.
(He laughs at his own joke.)

JOSEPHS
No, man, them let me in through the front. Of course now when I reach
the cashier and she turn up her nose and ask for all kind a identification
and I gi’ her everything: bank book, proof of residence, birth certificate,
report cawd, everything, just to draw out my own money, and she still get
up and go check with the Englishman. Him come back and him look pon
me good. And the two a them go back again and whisper some more. Then
she come back again and say I must write my name a second time mek she

mornin’, Mr. Josephs,” that them give me my money. And is only ten
pounds I did want.

ball out when I come up and take pity pon the poor thing and give her five
shilling fe get home. She still a cry when she thank me and say that the next
time I go to the bank, all I have fe do is come to her window and she will

take real good care a me.

TREVOR
Well at least you've solved your bank withdrawal problems.

JOSEPHS
Maybe, but you never know. Next time she might not be there an’ I'll have
