MOTHER SWABY
Because I’m already married.

JOSEPHS
But you want to be with me, not him.

MOTHER SWABY
I am with you, Mr. Josephs.

JOSEPHS
I don’t mean like this. I mean all the time.

MOTHER SWABY
I couldn't do that to Mr. Swaby.

JOSEPHS
That bastard. All he does is mistreat you. He just have you around so he can

cuss you. He's still in love with that yellow gal he married over a hundred

and four years ago.

MOTHER SWABY
Thirty-five.

JOSEPHS
What difference does it make?

(ADC comes out looking for Father Swaby.)

ADC
Evening, Mrs.

MOTHER SWABY
Evening, ADC.

ADC
You want me to do anything for you, sir, before dinner?

MOTHER SWABY
This isn’t Mr. Swaby, ADC. It’s Mr. Josephs.

ADC
Eh! And how come him sitting in Mastah’s chair and you next to him. I

don’t think I like that. I don’t think him goin’ like that either, Where him
is?

MOTHER SWABY
Where he usually is before dinner.
