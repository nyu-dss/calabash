FATHER SWABY
You're damn right I do. And I say I do mean anything by it.

MOTHER SWABY
Yes, dear, of course you do.

JOSEPHS
Then you don’t want anybody to drink with you?

FATHER SWABY
Nol!

TREVOR
Too bad. I was just about to have one.

FATHER SWABY
I didn’t say you couldn’t have one. Did I say he couldn't have one, did I?

MOTHER SWABY
No, dear, you didn’t.

TREVOR
Then what’s all the fuss about.

JOSEPHS
Indeed. Uh, no water for me.

FATHER SWABY
(He just makes an anguished sound.)

MOTHER SWABY
Why, Mr. Josephs, do you really take your rum straight. My father used to
drink it that way too. I’ve always admired a man who could drink his rum

straight.

FATHER SWABY
Oh, you have, have you?

(He throws his rum away and slams his glass down.)

Pour!

MOTHER SWABY
Yes, dear.
(She pours.)

FATHER SWABY
(He swills it down.)

Is that all it takes to get your admiration.
