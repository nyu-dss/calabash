MRS. JOHNSON
Bertie’s upstairs with the maid, by now he’s probably got her clothes off.
You're on the front verandah, of all places, entertaining your man friend
with your husband not ten feet away. Trevor's gone off with his Chinese
wench and Cynthia's somewhere behind a bush, with god only knows
who. And I’m left all alone with no one to choose from but ADC, who
doesn’t have a tooth left in his head, and the gardener boy who’s never
looked at anything that didn’t grow green leaves in his whole life. And you

expect me to worry about a chill.

MOTHER SWABY
Yes, Mistress Johnson. I’m going to send you back to the country if you
don’t behave yourself. You can’t work anymore anyway, so what good are
you?
JOSEPHS
Whereabouts in the country are you from, Mrs. Johnson?

MRS. JOHNSON
I don’t talk to anyone who's darker than I am.

JOSEPHS
Yes, Ma’am. Where’s she from?

MOTHER SWABY
Bamboo.

JOSEPHS
You're from Bamboo too, aren't you?

MOTHER SWABY
No, Savannah-la-Mart.

JOSEPHS
I could have sworn you told me Bamboo.

MOTHER SWABY
Well I didn’t. I should know where I’m from, shouldn't I?
