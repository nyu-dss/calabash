Does that mean that I must be only half loved?

JOSEPHS
Of course not. You must find a woman of your own and start your own tree

growing. Then you will be the patriarch. Whatever comes from you will be
your blood and yours alone. Remember, “God bless the child who's got his

”

Ownl.

TREVOR
It’s not blood that makes the difference, Mr. Josephs.

JOSEPHS
Not blood alone. But blood along with something else. Familiarity, having

the same things in common, living together, sharing life’s pleasures as well
as life’s pain.

TREVOR
The old brutalize their young, brothers kill each other off, sisters try to
marry the same man and one family takes a blood oath to destroy the other.
And as for familiarity, about the only thing we're sure of is that it breeds
contempt.

JOSEPHS

Oh, I don’t know. Take Mistress Swaby and me for instance. We're both
poor people from the country, members of the lower classes, you might say.
She goes and married an uppercrust like your father and it’s all right
because she’s what you call lower middle. Not too too lower, but not too
much middle either. But me now, I’m definitely not in the middle anyway
at all. I’m bottom, bottom. But we both come from the same part of the
Bush, so that means that we know one another, really know one another,
like family, like blood. Your father, while I respect him, will never know her
the way I know her. Never. Don't care how long he lives.

MOTHER SWABY
Trevor understands, dear. He’s got the same problem.

JOSEPHS
(Surprised.)
He does.
MOTHER SWABY
Yes, dear.
