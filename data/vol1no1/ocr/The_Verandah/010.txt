Calabash

(He waits for a beat.)
Shall I take a chair? I think so, rawther, don’t I?

(He sits, crossing bis legs and grinning at the two of them.)
FATHER SWABY
Isn't it enough that I’ve let you into my neighborhood. Do I have to put up

with your pestering on top of it?
JOSEPHS

Oh, is your neighborhood. I never know that. I thought it was government
neighborhood that belong to whosoever could afford to live in it. I know
you don’t own the road or the water, or my property what I pay good
money for. You own the street light? Huh? Or the sidewalk or what? I think
firs thing a mornin’ we have to go to Kingston and St. Andrew
Corporation and make them know that this is not Lady Musgrave Road, St.
Andrew Parish, but is Swaby Heights and him one own the whole a it and
everything that run through it, around it, under it and over and in it.

FATHER SWABY
I don’t have to own anything except this verandah and what’s on it. And I

don’t have to associate with anyone on my verandah that I don’t want to.

TREVOR
Now, father, Mr. Josephs is our neighbor to the right and we must be polite

to him. After all, we're polite to the MacPhersons and they’re our neigh-
bors to the left. So why can’t we be polite to Mr. Josephs.

FATHER SWABY
There are no Josephs, there is just one Josephs.

JOSEPHS
Him don’t like me ‘cause I’m not cousin to the Campbells like the

MacPhersons. I’m not cousins to anybody. I don’t even know where my
name came from. My mother was a poor, ignorant black woman from St.

Elizabeth, god rest her soul. Couldn’t even read and write.

FATHER SWABY
Oh. And can you read and write?

JOSEPHS
Not what you could call real readin’ and writin’. But I do have ten thou-

sand pounds in the Bank of Nova Scotia.
