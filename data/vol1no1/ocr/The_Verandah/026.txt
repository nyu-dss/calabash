TREVOR
No, he'll be all right. Let’s go in.

MOTHER SWABY
Yes, let’s. Won’t you join us for dinner, Mr. Josephs. I hate the thought of
anyone eating dinner alone. It’s so sad.

JOSEPHS
Oh I'm not alone. I’ve got the sound of happy laughter coming from here
to keep me company.

MONICA
Don’t you have any family, Mr. Josephs?

JOSEPHS
No. Only my mother before she died.

MONICA
And you never married?

JOSEPHS
No, never.

MONICA

A man should have a family, Mr. Josephs. Start his own line.

TREVOR
Grow his own tree.

MONICA
(Agreeing with Trevor eagerly.)
Yes!

JOSEPHS

I know. But I never found her. At least if I did, it was always the wrong
time or the wrong place.

MONICA
But there must be somebody in the whole wide world for you.

JOSEPHS
For me the world isn’t so wide. No wider than the street I live on and the

people I've come to know in these my years of tranquility, now that the
work is over and the labor has born fruit, the harvest safe and the house

secure.
