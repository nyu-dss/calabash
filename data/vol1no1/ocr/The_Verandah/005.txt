MOTHER SWABY
My dear, I don’t understand a word you're saying. You know I didn’t have

your advantages as a child.

TREVOR
Yes, that’s why father treats you so dreadfully, because you're a tradesman’s
daughter.

MOTHER SWABY
Yes, it’s your mother he really loved. She was so beautiful and delicate, like

one of his pink roses. I used to see her when she was a young girl. She'd

pass by our house in the horse and buggy.

TREVOR
When did my mother pass by your house ever, even in a horse and buggy?

MOTHER SWABY
Oh that was only once a month, when she’d go to town to visit the
Campbells.

TREVOR
Of, of course, the Campbells.

MOTHER SWABY
What did it mean, dear? I so like to be educated by you.

TREVOR

(Back to his paper.)
What did what mean?

MOTHER SWABY
What you said about the mint. That it was ... so pungent that it was sensual

in its redolence.

TREVOR
That the fragrance was so pleasingly strong that it could create a sexual

arousal. Which might have been reaching a bit.

MOTHER SWABY
In the case of your father’s mint, I would say yes, it most definitely was
reaching a bit.

TREVOR
(He laughs, enjoying the joke with her.)
MOTHER SWABY
Shall I get you more tea, this seems to have gotten cold.
