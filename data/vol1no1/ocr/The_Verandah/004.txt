TREVOR
You or someone else.

FATHER SWABY
It's obvious that I was speaking generically. One does understand that,
doesn’t one?

(Just then the band concert at Hope Gardens begins with the band playing GoD
SAVE THE KING. Its heard tn the distance.)

TREVOR
The band concert at Hope is just beginning. They’re playing God Save the
King.
FATHER SWABY
Then why don’t you stand at attention and salute for christ’s sake.

(MOTHER SWABY comes out. Father Swaby takes one look at her and goes down
into the garden, afier making another deprecating sound, this time at her.)

MOTHER SWABY
And how are you this evening, Trevor?

TREVOR
Fine, Mater. And yourself?

MOTHER SWABY
Oh, it’s such a lovely evening. I feel absolutely exhilarated.

TREVOR
Yes, there’s a good breeze coming from the mountain.

MOTHER SWABY
And they're playing God Save the King.

TREVOR
Yes. The guango tree looks bigger than ever.

MOTHER SWABY
And the lignum vitae is as strong as a rock.

TREVOR
But father’s roses haven't done well.

MOTHER SWABY
No, poor dear, But his mint on the other hand...

TREVOR
Ah, his mint! It fills the air with an aroma that is so pungent that it’s sen-
sual in its redolence. It literally caroms about like an elfin in a dance.
