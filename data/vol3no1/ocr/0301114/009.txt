mind as the act of the boyfriend molesting the child). As well, in terms of my depiction
of men, I think with the sequence on my father that I was trying to give voice to & offer
the perspective of the male figure. In the first book, even when invoked, my father is
notably at a remove (“jack mandoora”; “Sunset on the Wharf” for example); so in the
second book I was consciously trying to make of his absence a presence. I don’t know
how well I achieved that goal. The only male in my life who has been a constant and
positive presence (before my husband — so I mean more as I was a child and young
woman) is my grandfather. He is the “Papa” of the poem “Wolves” (from the second
book) and also the voice of explanation of a fractured world for the child in “jack
mandoora,” though not an altogether hopeful one as his explanation often is “tings just
mek that way,” which translates to things just happen without explanation. My husband
has only furthered my sense of the possibilities for men and women, who live in a
patriarchal world where violence against women is so prevalent, to overcome that pattern
of interaction.

Ultimately, though, you are right to note the bias in my work. Most often, the voices I
hear are those of women and the lives and perspectives I am interested in representing are
those of women. This is still true in the new poems I’ve been writing where, for
example, my grandmother, the “Miss Sally” character in one of the poems from Song of
Thieves, makes more appearances. I don’t know that ll every get away from — nor do I
want to get away from — offering up the truths I know, as a woman.

Q. In your first collection, the interplay of different languages (as in “jack
mandoora”) "and magic realism, used in the rewriting of Western folktales and stories of
Afro-Caribbean tradition, were more conspicuous. Does your second book mark a
conscious transition in style? And if so, in what direction?

A. If there is a transition in style, it certainly wasn’t a conscious one. I’m noticing a
theme to my answers here — which isn’t an intentional coyness on my part but rather an
expression of my desire not to think too much about where I’m going, in an overall sense,
as a writer. I’m more interested in discovering piece by piece what individual poems and
sequences of poems (as I do tend to work on larger projects at a time) require. I'd like to
think that all of the different “styles” and influences to which I have access will
ultimately be useful for me in expressing the concerns of various poems. You never
know what you’ll be doing tomorrow as a writer or what you’ll need to get you there (in
terms of language, style, and other tools of expression). In my new work I am again
writing more poems in patwa. I don’t know what that means, though I suspect this is
coming about because of subject matter. I don’t write a poem in Standard English and
then translate it to creole. It either comes in one form or to the other, in terms of how I
hear it.

With “jack mandoora,” my decision to go back and forth between patwa and Standard
English (and blur the languages in some sections) was deliberate and my only really
conscious use of the interplay of language I can think of. I wanted to dramatize the
feeling of being between both cultures and worlds (which language denotes) and trying to
bridge those.
