Q. Your first collection’s epigraph is a quote from Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea,
while in the second collection you quote from a Bob Marley song and John Keats's Ode
to a Nightingale. These are, if you’ll excuse my scholarly analysis, a quote from a
Caribbean icon, another from a British poet, and one from a writer who is considered
caught between these two cultures — a white Creole woman who is still the subject of
heated debates about whether she “belongs” to one or the other. Is this combined choice
of motto a conscious decision to bring together your many “skins” or am I totally wrong
here?

A. This is an interesting series of questions. I wouldn’t say that your analysis is
“wrong’— I could certainly see that reading of the epigraphs; but it’s easier for me to talk
about how I came to use the epigraphs than to say that I was making a conscious
statement regarding hybridity, which seems to be at the heart of your reading of them.
My decisions regarding the use of these quotes as epigraphs were more capricious and
less carefully constructed than your reading of them gives me credit for.

In terms of my connection to the epigraph for the first book, I read Wide Sargasso Sea in
my second year of graduate school and was struck by the language more than the
narrative of the novel. I wrote down the quote, which later became the epigraph for Zhe
Water Between Us, in my journal. This was a couple of years before ’'d envisioned the
poems I was writing as a book. Later, after ’'d assembled the collection, the quote came
back to me and seemed very apt for speaking to one of the main concerns of the book as I
saw it at the time — the desire to interrogate where truth lies. I knew a bit about Jean
Rhys’s life, enough then to know that others might see the quote as a reference to my
sense of a shared heritage; ironically, though, while I do see echoes of her
insider/outsider status in my own life and work in a general sense, I don’t feel a
connection to her background (she’s from a different moment in Caribbean history, a
different island, and a different social & racial background than I am) so much as I do to
her work as a writer. I love the language of Wide Sargasso Sea and think there’s
something very Caribbean about the reality it creates and how Rhys does that —
regardless of her origins. Again, ’m not terribly familiar with the criticism on Rhys but
my understanding is that when she’s questioned as a Caribbean writer it’s due to her
belonging to the white aristocracy at that time, is that right? Did she also live abroad a
good bit of her life? If living in the Caribbean is one of the criteria for being a Caribbean
writer then not only Rhys but any number of us are in trouble.

With the quotes for Song of Thieves, I can say that pairing them was a conscious decision
on my part, though for somewhat different reasons than you’ve noticed. I have long been
interested, and remain so, in exploring different sources of poetic language (the “literary”
and. the “vernacular” and everything in between). Marley and Keats were two of the
poets who were influential in my earliest formation as a writer (I mean earliest as in
before I knew I wanted to be or could be a writer). Taken together, as well as
individually, for me they embody poetry’s ability to speak to the personal and historical
in a voice that is both highly “poetic” and intensely idiomatic.
