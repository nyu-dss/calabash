“T AM THE LINE BREAK OF DESIRE”
A CONVERSATION WITH SHARA McCALLUM

Shara McCallum's sensual first collection of poems, Zhe Water Between Us (1999;
winner of the 1998 Agnes Lynch Starrett Prize), introduced to us the exhilarating beat of
her verses. Her second collection, Song of Thieves (2003), continues to pulsate to the
rhythm of distant Caribbean music, leaving the reader dizzy and breathless and asking for
more.

The daughter of a multicultural family — born in Jamaica to Afro-Jamaican and
Venezuelan parents — she fuses on the page different languages and experiences,
transmuting words into a synesthetic whole, brimming with colors and music.

Both collections deal with issues of identity, tearful separations and abandonment, but
also with the wonder of self-discovery. Emotions and feelings are shaped with such craft
that the reader, any reader of any country or continent, is made to share and feel the pain,
the loss, the happy moments that are brought so vibrantly to the fore.

Long before the publication of her dazzling debut collection, her talent had brought her to
the attention of critics and scholars, and in 1996, still in college and very young, she was
awarded The Academy of American Poets Prize. Nominated for several Pushcart Prizes,
she is the recipient of a Tennessee Individual Artist Grant in Literature and a grant from
the Barbara Deming Memorial Fund.

Her poems and essays have been published in several journals, among them 7he Antioch
Review, Callaloo, Creative Nonfiction, Ploughshares, Witness, Chelsea, The Iowa
Review, and Verse; and appeared in various anthologies, such as The New American
Poets: A Bread Loaf Anthology and Beyond the Frontier: African American Poetry for
the Twenty-First Century.

Currently, she is the Director of the Stadler Center for Poetry at Bucknell University,
where she also teaches.
