Q. Often in your poems, the act of artistic creation, of giving birth to a poem, is
combined with the act of giving birth to a living creature. Can you share with us your
view on these two acts of giving birth?

A. Sure, giving birth means you don’t write anymore (as a mother of an almost-one-
year old who is only now finding slivers of time to return to writing, I had to get that in
there.) It’s really enlightening to read your questions, Michela, because I’m seeing many
connections in my own poems that I honestly hadn’t seen prior. This question brings up
one such link. I haven’t thought long enough about the act of giving birth to have a
strong impression of its relationship to creating art, outside of the practical matter of time
and energy being required for both, as I alluded to in light-hearted fashion above. ?ma
pretty slow learner when it comes to understanding my own experiences, so I think it will
be some time before I can speak with authority to this matter in my own life. Still, Pl
hazard an opinion and say that both acts come from the same place. The desire to
progenerate, whether achieved by having a child or giving birth to a work of art,
represents the urge to save oneself or some part of oneself from extinction.

It’s only in the last two weeks that I’ve written a poem about Rachel, my daughter, and
it’s an odd mother-daughter poem for me in that it doesn’t have much of the specifics of
either the mother or the daughter in the poem. The only image that describes either one
of us is rather disembodied (I describe my daughter’s voice at one point as “unfurl[ing]
bright wings,/alighting in each corner of this house”). Iimagine I'll write more poems
about my relationship to her at some point; but, for at least right now, I haven’t written
enough about the experience to understand how it has shaped me.

Q. Fathers, mothers, siblings, are conspicuously present in both collections. How
much of your actual family is “present” in your poems? Or, better, how do you transform
family members through poetry? [I understand this is a delicate question, an the answer
may be none of my business — you can tell me so, and I’ll understand you perfectly. ]

A. My family members populate my work, as you notice. They do so, to my mind,
both actually and in transformed fashion, hopefully in one and the same moment. The
facts of their lives (my own life and them in relation to it, might be a more accurate way
to put this) are often very close to “true” and I am not compelled to make up information,
particularly if it is a central concern within the poem. Still, for me, the literal truths are
less important than the emotional or psychological ones with which a poem is concerned;
and, in many cases, my family members (particularly my father and my grandmother)
have become larger-than-life figures in the poems.

I think it’s important to say, as well, that so much of the information of my family’s
history has been obscured or is disputed; so that it has been difficult to reach a consensus
on some of the “facts” of our lives. As I’ve said before in other contexts, I think I began
to write in part to sort out my family’s history, which doesn’t seem as stable to me as it
might to others. For example, my grandparents for years told my sisters and I that we
were “white” while simultaneously telling me that my “hair could give me away” and
while my mother was telling us that our father considered himself “black.” My
