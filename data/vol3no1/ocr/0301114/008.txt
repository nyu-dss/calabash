the relationship between the man and women who processes or directs the scene. Ina
dramatic sense, he is the narrator of the unfolding scene.

I think the difference in tone you note (light vs. dark) between the two halves of the
image also very much correlates to the two books. This isn’t something that I saw,
though, until I finished the second book. The poems in the second book were harder to
write for me — emotionally/intellectually. They didn’t come as easily, which is to say that
I struggled more to find out what the poems wanted to say.

Q. Could you tell us about the genesis of the titles of the two collections? While the
first might seem clear, it is not immediately so for the second.

A. The title for the first book, as you note, is clearer as it comes up in a poem in the
collection as the last line of that poem (“Jamaica, October 18, 1972”).

The second book also takes its title from a poem in the collection, though the poem didn’t
keep the title: “The Story So Far” was initially called “The Song of the Thief.” While I
didn’t think the title fit for the poem, ultimately, I liked the idea contained in it. The
notion of theft or thievery as something beautiful (as a song) appeals to me. It speaks a
paradox contained, for example, in the idea of the sirens — that something dangerous,
even deadly, is enticing and seductive. When I was looking for a title for the collection,
the title seemed to work in metaphoric fashion, as so many of the poems deal with
different kinds of theft (suicide, exile). As the thefts were multiple in the collection, I
pluralized the title so it became “Song of Thieves.” Two other, more personal,
connections, prompted the title. One, I like the idea and history of the poet as singer. My
name, Shara, in Hebrew actually means “she sings,” its root being Shira, which means
both poem & song, as the ancient poets were singers. This is how, of course, the notion
of the lyric comes about — a lyric poem originally being a “little song.” The second
connection for me was that I liked the echo to “Song of Songs,” the most beautiful
writing in the Hebrew Bible I think. Anyway, all these ideas (for me at least) were in the
title. I’m not sure how many of them come across for a reader, though.

Q. One may observe that men are often portrayed in less the favorable light in your
poems: They are figures in the wings who, when stepping on stage are, more often than
not, bearers of unutterable violence and abuse. Reading the work of other writers of
Caribbean background, I can’t but notice the similarities in the depiction of males. Would
you say that these presumed similarities are just a coincidence?

A. Well, this is indeed a tough one. I can see that men are portrayed less favourably
at times in my work. They are often absent, as you note; or, when present, they are
frequently the agents of violence. It is the case that my experiences early on, at the hands
of men, were sometimes violent and that I witnessed such violence done to other women
as well, including my mother. I know that I draw on that.

On the other hand, I don’t think that I exempt women from their participation in that

violence (poems like “Mother Love” for example, indict the mother for knowing that her
daughter is being abused and turning away from the child; that act is as violent to my
