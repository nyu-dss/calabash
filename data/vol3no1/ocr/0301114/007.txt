“transformed” earlier in regard to the question of my use of familial figures. If I didn’t in
some way transform the experience, I don’t think that the work would have much value
for me or for areader. If I didn’t end up somewhere different from where I began in a
poem, I wouldn’t experience the kind of knowledge I hope to glean from writing poetry.

Q. Your two collections are connected in many ways, but are also very different. On
the one hand they seem to form a whole, on the other they represent different
perspectives. The book-covers, for instance, are two parts of a single painting, where the
part you chose for the first collection projects what appears to me as a happier scene,
highlighting the female figures and introducing the collection’s "content", echoed in the
title: the relationship between mothers and daughters. The other, darker, painting detail,
chosen for the second collection, depicts a male figure and seems to reflect the darker
side of humanity. Would you say that the content of your collections is reflected in the
choice of book covers, that is that the form and the content are "one"? How would you
describe the differences and the similarities between the two collections?

A. I'd agree with you that form and content are ideally two parts of the same moment
of expression in a given work of art. The two books are united in my mind, though how
so is hard to articulate precisely. While different in approach and tone, both books are
moments in the same process of becoming for the narrator, who is a persona of myself.
Both books seem connected, then, if not by a sensibility of form or tone then by an actual
sensibility. Most of the poems chronicle a search for an understanding of the self (in
relation to family figures, historical pressures connected with immigration, and God even,
this latter being more overt in the 2"° book).

My choice of the single painting, split in two, reflects the fact that these books are
twinned endeavours in this process of becoming. This choice of covers wasn’t one that I
made at the outset of the writing of either book, though. When I chose the painting for
the first book, it was after the book was completed. I loved the painting as a whole but
felt that it was necessary to crop it because only the women in the painting seemed
relevant to the poems I had written then. Perhaps the other half of the painting was
already prompting the second book, though if so, in much less conscious fashion. After
finishing the second book, I was trying to think of an image for the cover and only then
remember thinking about the other half of the painting. I think my husband is the one
who actually suggested it.

On the level of content or subject matter, the first book deals primarily with women’s
lives (my mother and my relationship to her), the second is centered more on my father,
or at least the first section and poem sequence is. The halves of the painting uncannily
seemed to capture that. As well, the man — if you look at the painting as the artist Carl
Abrahams intended it to be received, as all of a piece — is set off from the women. While
he’s playing to them, the colours that surround him in contrast to those around the women
are much more somber. While they are in motion, he is still. It’s unclear, in my reading
of the painting, whether the girls/women hear his playing since their reality seems so
divorced from his; yet, it could be read as if he is playing to them. The archer, in the
upper right-hand corner, is also an interesting figure — being perhaps the one outside of
