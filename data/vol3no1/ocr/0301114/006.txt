grandparents later explained that we are “coloured” or “Jamaica white,” a category
meaning something quite different that “white” in American contexts. There are many
reasons I think this sliperyness of truth occurred, including the fact that notions of race in
Jamaica and the US are quite different and that immigrant identity is often built on
shifting sands. Nevertheless, I am one body, no matter where I may be located
geographically, and have had to reconcile my identity in a way that makes sense to me.
Another example, which might be more appropo, or at least less politically contentious, is
of my father’s life. As I write about in Song of Thieves, he suffered from schizophrenia
and committed suicide. I didn’t find this out until I was 20-years old. My father died
when I was 9. For the years in between, I lived believing that he had died in a car
accident; I had been told (or imagined, I’m not sure which) that it was due to a person
driving drunk. I lived with this “truth” while also remembering my father and his
schizophrenic behaviours (though I didn’t have that word to attach to him as a child nor
was it one I ever heard in my house).

Q. Colors, sounds, perfumes, are brought together on the page and your poems stir
all senses at once. Would you define your poems as synesthetic? Is there a painter, a
composer, a poet or a writer who influenced you most, and in what way?

A. I mentioned Keats and Marley before and Amichai and Tsvetaeva — all writers I
admire. I could list many other names and have in the past when asked this question; but
today I’m in the mood to answer it slant, as I have been doing with some of these already.
The question of influences is always hard to answer if you’re someone, like me, who
doesn’t like to be pinned down. It reminds me too of when, as a child, my grandmother —
who is Catholic — would have me pray and at the end of the prayers, bless people, and I
would worry, and I mean really worry (as Iimagine many a child does) about leaving
someone out and therefore being responsible for them not being blessed, or worse, their
dying. I’m being hyperbolic of course — no one will die if I don’t answer this and I don’t
anymore think that my blessing anyone could save his or her life.

To return to your question more directly, though, I don’t know that influences for an
artist (meaning what inspires or teaches) are always apparent in the finished work or that
we are fully conscious of them.

Q. In your essay "Writing the Self, the Self that Writes" (Calabash, I, 2) you touch
upon themes that are central to your poetry, such as exile, isolation, belonging. How do
you metamorphose your personal experience into the creation of poetry?

A, I write in order to understand what I think about a given subject, incident, idea,
etc. This naturally lends itself for me to writing about experiences that are personal. It’s
not a given, though, that because an experience I’m recounting deals with a painful
reality that it necessarily creates pain for me to write about it. In fact, it’s sometimes the
opposite.

Still, acknowledging that some of what I write confronts knowledge (of myself and
others) that is difficult, I’m glad you use the word metamorphosis — as you used the word
