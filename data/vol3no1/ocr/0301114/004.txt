The other reason I paired these two very different works in the epigraph is that I like the
paradox created by the juxtaposition of the two lines. In writing elegies, I think you are
essentially writing a paradox. By invoking the person or thing which 1s lost, you are
trying to free yourself of the loss while acknowledging that you are bound to something
which is irretrievable. In one regard (a not too-morbid one, I hope), the main impulse for
my work is elegiac. Yehuda Amichai says something in a poem, which speaks to this
idea even more directly than do my pairing of Marley & Keats’ lines: “What I will never
see again, I must love forever.” There’s a (perhaps related) statement by Marina
Tsvetaeva that’s been in my head since I read it: “One’s homeland is not a geographical
convention but an insistence of memory and blood.” The Tsvetaeva quote is off the topic
of writing elegies (in a way), but my point — if I can try to connect this back to your
question of my investment in the personal history of the writers I read & quote — is that
I’m more often moved by writing (and the world and ideas a poem conjures) than by
writers themselves. In fact, I know little of Tsvetaeva’s life, other than the fact that she
was Russian.

Q. Going back to Keats's Ode, the poem expresses the poet's concern with creativity
and the process of creating a work of art; an "immortal Bird" with its song becomes a
symbol for the figure of the poet and for art and poetry in general. The process of creating
a work of art — often described as painful — is also, in many ways, at the center of your
poems. I am thinking now of two poems in your second collection, "The Spiders Speak"
and "Six Ways of Envisioning Loss." In the former, spider’s webs come to represent the
threads, the lines that a poet has to write (and here I hear an echo of Robert Browning,
correct me if Iam wrong), a poet who, like a spider, has "no choice but to spin," and
"give" her/his own "form," that is to create and give immortality through poetry. In the
latter, the third stanza is a reflection on the creation of poetry, on the way "words" are
gathered by the poet, who transforms them into poetry.

Can you elaborate on the way you succeed in bringing together the artistic reflection, the
foundation of creation, and the actual writing of a poem?

A. Can I answer “no” to this one (smile)? In all seriousness, I don’t know how to
answer this question exactly. When I’m in the process of writing a poem, I’m trying to
find out what the poem’s objective is and to communicate that as clearly as I can. This
objective may or may not be the same as what I started out imagining I wanted to say and
often involves my using all kinds of devices and approaches to get to the heart of the
poem, many of which I'd be hard pressed to describe or account for after the fact of
writing. The poem succeeds for me, more or less, depending on how much I feel I am
articulating its objective. When I’m finished writing a poem, generally I don’t think
about the process of writing it anymore. In fact, when I can no longer bear to think about
this, that’s often the sign to me that a poem is “finished” — whether to my liking or not.
I’m going off on a tangent here, though, and don’t think I’m really answering your
question, which seems to be more about how I include the act of writing within a poem. I
don’t know, other than to say that individual poems dictate when such self-conscious
attention to the act of writing would be useful for communicating the larger objective of
the poem.
