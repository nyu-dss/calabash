As to the presence of magic realism, it’s interesting that this seems more prevalent in the
first book — I guess it really is — though “The Story of the Madwoman by the Sea” is, for
me, the poem most consciously inflected by that literary heritage I feel as a person from
the part of the world where magic and reality are often blurred.

Q. The issue of belonging has been, and still is, at the core of many studies, debates,
books and essays, and it is also central to your writing. Different languages and diverse
cultures coexist in you and in your poems. Do you feel you embody that same
“Creoleness” that Jean Bernabé, Patrick Chamoiseau and Raphael Confiant have proudly
described in their EJoge de la Créolité. In Praise of Creoleness? How difficult is it today
—if at all — being the daughter of many cultures; and how does the awareness of such a
heritage inform your writing?

A. Well, it seems to me it affects my writing profoundly. Were I not of these
different cultures, I’m not sure I would have become a writer. I know it is a pretty self-
serving motive but I do think I became a writer to first and foremost figure things out for
myself.

Not being the daughter of a single culture, I yet know many writers who are of one place
and one heritage. Many of these writers are still concerned with analogous feelings of
exile (from God, from other people, from the self, just to name a few of the “big” themes
in literature). So, perhaps my connecting my identity as a writer to my biography is an
oversimplification. Perhaps I would still be obsessed with issues of identity and
belonging and would just express those in a different way.

I’ve read the piece you’ re citing, by the way — I used it in an article I wrote on a novel by
Julia Alvarez precisely because I think it’s one of the best articulations of Caribbean
identity ’ve ever come across. Given my love of Keats, I can’t help but connect this
notion of being an identity in-flux (“creoleness”) with Keats’ idea of “negative
capability,” which so appealed to me as a young woman and student of literature before I
could articulate its relevance to my own life or self.

Q. I must admit I’m fascinated by the mermaid metaphor of a creature that is neither
woman nor fish, forced to choose between her two natural selves. In The Water Between
Us, the mermaid was a central figure; while in Song of Thieves, she has practically
vanished. Is it because the mermaid has already made her choice and there is no return?
And if so, what has she discovered in her land or sea of choice?

A. It’s so funny you should mention this. I’ve returned to working on a prose poem
in the past couple weeks (one I began years ago) called, “The Mermaid.” In trying to
finish the poem, I’ve been wondering why I keep coming back to it and if I have anything
new to say about the paradox and conundrum which defines the mermaid’s existence.
This mermaid is a mother. Her choice to return to the sea is made in the face of what
might seem to be compelling reasons to stay: her children who are bound to the land. I
