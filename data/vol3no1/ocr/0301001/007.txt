settlement nearby-- there had been some movement over the border, since Toussaint had
claimed the Spanish side of the island for France. The women straightened from their
work and stared after the riders, in a grave silence, without a smile or a wave. They and
their families would be fugitives, Maillart thought, from Toussaint’s labor laws.

In the late afternoon their party was startled by a runaway horse rushing down the
river toward them, on the opposite bank. The shoreline was too high and rocky to cross in
this place, so there was nothing they could do but pull up an watch the spectacle. It was a
splendid animal, however wild, a magnificent blue roan. The horse came down the far
bank full tilt, punctuating its gallop with episodes of explosive bucking. Through it all the
rider was fixed in the saddle, as tight as a barnacle-- no daylight to find between his rump
and the leather. He was in shirtsleeves, a white shirt open to the breastbone. When he
came nearer, Maillart saw the yellow madras headcloth.

“My Christ,” he said, with a glance at Coachy. “It’s the Governor-General.”

Toussaint and his furious mount shot passed them by a hundred yards or more.
Then at last the run petered out and the exhausted roan collapsed into a walk. No choice
now but to accept the rider. Toussaint turned the roan and brought it back up the bank on
a fairly short rein. Now Riau and Guiaou had appeared on their horses, riding toward to
Toussaint at an easy canter. Riau held a braided lariat coiled in his right hand, but
Toussaint waved it away-- no need.

Coachy called across the river to Guiaou, who beckoned them to follow. They
went at a walk, since Toussaint’s horse was blown. The roan had run something more
than a mile downriver, Maillart realized. It was at least that far when they reached a ford,
and above it on the farther shore was a long oval corral which penned about thirty more
as-yet-unbroken horses.

Maillart had heard from Tocquet and others that Toussaint maintained a hatte like
this somewhere across the Spanish border. Apparently Tocquet had once been charged to
herd a string of these horses down across the Central Plateau to Gonaives. Maillart
splashed across the ford, raised his hand to salute the others. Riau returned the smartly.
Toussaint, smiling more openly than was usual for him, was buttoning his shirt with his
free hand. Soaked with sweat, the white cloth clung transparently to the ribbed muscle of
his torso. Only a tuft of grizzled hair at the throat betrayed his age.

“Mon général,” Maillart said. “When you risk yourself so, you risk the colony.”
