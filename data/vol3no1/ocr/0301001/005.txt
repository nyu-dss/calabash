expanded all around the crossroads as far as the eye could see, to the ocean in one
direction and the mountains in the other.

Coachy, who led the squad, called a halt and purchased six green coconuts. With
short chopping blows of his saber he opened each one and handed it around. The men
shared the thin sweet liquor before breaking the shells apart for the white meat.

Maillart bought a stalk of bananas Ti-Malice and immediately broke off four of
them for the two small boys who were crawling around the old woman’s low stool. The
children sat up and stared at him, too shy to peel their fruit. Maillart ate a couple of the
bananas himself-- each about the size of his thumb-- and offered them to the other men,
but still two thirds of the stalk was left for him to tie at his saddlebow before remounting.

The rode in the direction of Ouaniminthe, maintaining a gentle trot. Toussaint had
outfitted the two thousand men of his personal guard with the best horses on the island;
they ate up the ground relentlessly. The road was pinkish dust and the plain surrounding
it almost featureless except for a few longhorned cattle grazing over the pasture. Boeuf
marron, Coachy muttered, whenever he saw one of these, wild beef. His eyes lit up with
appetite.

Maillart was adrift in his own relentless humor. He carried a note from Tocquet to
Toussaint, announcing the arrival of the muskets, but this was a matter of no great
urgency-- boatloads of guns hove into the Le Cap harbor almost everyday, it seemed. The
truth was, he’d wanted to get out of town. The arrival of Isabelle’s children had disrupted
his amours, though of course it was only natural for her to dote upon them after such a
terribly long separation. The children, who might have half-forgotten her during their
long absence, were rather cool to her at first. She won back Heloise, the younger, easily
enough, but Robert remained aloof. It was absurd to be jealous of a twelve-year-old boy!
...and yet Maillart had felt that sting.

The worst was that Isabelle wasn’t doing it to torment him, as in her sometime
dalliances with other swains she had been, at least in part. No, this time she was not
thinking about Maillart at all. Possibly there’d be no coals to discover under the ashes this
time around, supposing her attention ever returned. After all, Isabelle was far from her
youth, Maillart reflected, and there was always the modestly inconvenient matter of her
husband. He might have sought the affections of another... however it was surprising

how many attractive white women of the town were receptive to the addresses of the
