At the end of the meal, Maillart presented Tocquet’s note, and as Toussaint cut
the seal with his thumbnail, he went to fetch the musket from the shipment he’d brought
along to show. The demonstration struck him as a little excessive (add the extra weight
had been irksome), but Tocquet must be feeling some immediate need to remind
Toussaint of his usefulness.... Nodding, Toussaint slipped the letter into his coat and
stood up to receive the musket. Taking a step away from the table, he turned the weapon
this way and that in the fading light, then pulled back the hammer to test the spring.

“Tt is not new,” he said. “French-- the M-seventeen-sixty-three. But condition is
good.” He whistled sharply at one of the barefoot men who had served the tables, and
when he raised his head, Toussaint tossed him in the musket. Maillart’s eyes tracked its
flight. The barefoot man caught the musket in both hands.

“Ki jan ou relé?” Toussaint said. What is your name?

“Guerrier, parrain,” said the barefoot man with a broad smile. “Guerrier, sé

not actually at war. He noticed too how naturally the man had addressed Toussaint as

“Lé ou wé envahisse, ki sa wap fé?” Toussaint inquired. What will you do when
you see the invader?

“Tiré, tuyé.” Guerrier had brought the musket to his shoulder with an air of
sufficient competence, and was sighting down at the shoals of the river. Shoot to kill.

“Byen, kenbe’l,” Toussaint said. Good, keep at it. Then, almost as an after

thought, he told Guerrier to report Riau for an assignment and a horse.

Next morning Guerrier rode out among Toussaint’s guard, well-mounted though
without the silver helmet. He wore a ragged pair of Revolutionary trousers with the
horizontal stripes, which was his only sign of a uniform. But he was a horseman, Maillart
took note, his carriage in the saddle as presentable as anyone’s. Toussaint rode third in
their single file, with Coachy and Guiaou in the lead. As usual in the field he wore a
simple blue uniform coat without epaulettes, and today he had put aside his general’s

bicorne for a round hat, a plume fixed to it with the tricolor Revolutionary rosette. The
