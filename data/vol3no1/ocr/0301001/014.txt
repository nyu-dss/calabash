forcefully that Maillart expected to see dust stir on the ground between his feet. He strode
to Bel Argent, dropped the folded desk into one of the saddlebags, and from the other
pulled out a fat feather pillow sheathed in rose-colored silk. Because of his short legs, his
head barely reached the horse’s shoulder, but a one-handed vault put him into the saddle.
He stood high in the stirrups, adjusting the pillow beneath him, then settled down upon it.

Maillart caught himself breathing through an open mouth. He had seen Toussaint
take out the feather pillow only once or twice before; in rides of normal duration he
didn’t bother with the cushion. What it implied was that he meant to remain in the saddle
for several days straight.

“Nalé!” he said. A short sharp bark: Let’s go. And now, with a twirl of his left

hand, and squeeze of his heels, he was already gone.
