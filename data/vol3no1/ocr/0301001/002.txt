POINT SAMANA:
AN EXCERPT FROM
THE STONE THAT THE BUILDER REFUSED

On the thirty-first day of their voyage, the troopship Jean-Jacques drew within a
range of La Siréne and lowered a boat which labored slowly toward them over the deep
swells. The passenger in the bow was an ensign who carried a letter addressed to Placide
and his brother. Admiral Latouche-Treville presented his compliments and desired the
sons of Toussaint Louverture to transfer themselves and their efforts to the Jean-Jacques.

Within half an hour they had loaded their belongings onto the same boat that had
brought the message. Isaac’s face looked pale to Placide, who sat facing him, opposite
the oarsmen, but this was from excitement now, not nausea. He had got over the last of
his seasickness weeks ago. Today was a clear morning, with the wind freshening in the
east. The boat tossed like a chip among the billows. The troughs were deep enough that at
the moments they could not see either ship. Monsieur Coisnon crouched, clutching the
gunwales, but Placide felt light-hearted, and Isaac went so far as to drop an arm and trail
his fingers through the sea-green water. Coisnon shook his head tightly and mouthed the
word shark. Isaac, grinning cheerfully, raised his dripping hand and kissed his salty
fingers toward the tutor.

Arrived, the boys climbed a swinging ladder to the deck of Jean-Jacques. While
Coisnon went immediately below to claim space for themselves and their trunks, the boys
remained topside, flush with the excitement of the change and activity. For some reason

the two ships held a tight parallel course, and the boat shoved off again toward La Siréne.
