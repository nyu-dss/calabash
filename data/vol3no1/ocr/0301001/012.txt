He folded the spyglass and held it toward Toussaint, but the black general seemed
blind to the offer. He had taken his sheathed sword from his belt and stood leaning on it
as if it were a cane. His face remained bloodless; he seemed to shrink inside his clothes.
For the first time Maillart saw the man’s age visible upon him.

Finally Toussaint did reach for the spyglass. Unconsciously he dropped it into a
coat pocket, then walked haltingly to a boulder at the cliff's edge and sat down, balancing
the sheathed sword across his knees. At a little distance, Guiaou and Coachy and the
others of the guard stood by their horses, staring at the fleet with an impassivity they
could barely maintain. It was not the number of the ships that frightened them, Maillart
realized, but that their commander had been so obviously shaken.

But how could Toussaint have known the magnitude of France? The black general
had made himself so absolutely master of the island that Maillart had forgotten that he
had never been anywhere else-- that he was born in Santo Domingo and had never left its
shores. As for himself, he had been twelve years in the colony, and France, the
motherland, might just as well have been a fancy, or a dream.

A smaller frigate had detached from the fleet and was sailing northeast around the
peninsula. They would be landing a small party, Maillart supposed, to get the news and
maybe look for pilots. Toussaint seemed indifferent to the movement, if he had noticed it
at all, and presently the ship had disappeared around the headland. Maillart remembered
what he’d said two nights before, when he’d tossed the musket to Guerrier. But why must
this advent be taken for invasion, why not the simple arrival of a friendly force? After all,
Toussaint had always professed his loyalty to France and almost always seemed to act on
it. Could not this point be put forward? Maillart took a step and cleared his throat, but
Toussaint had already spoken.

“Riau.” Now the voice was crisp and clear, though not too loud. “Vin ‘pal’ou.”
That radical compression in the creole phrase, Come her to me so I can talk to you. Riau
lowered his head to Toussaint’s lips, then dashed to Bel Argent’s saddlebags, took out a
folding writing desk and returned to sit cross-legged below the boulder where Toussaint
was stationed.

Maillart remained where he was. He felt-- no, he knew himself to be held at
exactly this distance, just a few paces from Toussaint and his scribe, but, with the noise

of the waves slamming into the rocks below, completely out of earshot. Toussaint was on
