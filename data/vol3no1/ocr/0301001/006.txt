black officers, the most enterprising of whom were advancing in wealth as well as in
power, as Toussaint put the plantations back to work.

Therefore Maillart had tried to distract himself in a thirty-six hour fling with a
colored courtesan of his acquaintance. This woman, though beautiful and exquisitely
skilled in her profession, had finally left him a feeling of shame. And it was generally
uneasy around the town, with the constant rumors of an expedition coming from France.
A turn in the countryside, Maillart had thought, might do him some good.

For the last hour the grade of plain had been gradually mounting, and the
afternoon light reddened on their backs. A final twist of the road spilled them onto the
main street of Ouaniminthe. All of a sudden they had an escort of barking dogs and
scattering goats and small children running alongside the horses shouting “Toussaint!

Toussaint! Papa Toussaint!” They’d recognized the fine horses and tall riders, the plumes
and silver helmets each with the motto “Qui pourra en venire a bout?” But Toussaint was

to share his room with only Coachy. A barrel of rum was quickly discovered, some
chickens commandeered for their supper. Maillart turned in and slept without dreams. At
dawn they were riding again through a low pass eastward toward the Saint Yago river.

By midmorning they had reached the river valley and were riding eastward along
the low bank. The mountains rose towering on either side, dark verdant peaks thrusting
into the clouds. There were few signs of cultivation or even of inhabitation, except every
so often a thread of smoke from a charcoal fire hidden on a jungled slope. Once when

they rounded a bend of the river onto a wide flat shoal of gravel, they came upon a dozen

black women washing clothes. The laundresses must have come out from some maroon
