his feet now, pacing, gesticulating, while Riau bent over the desktop on his knees, pen
point grooving the parchment. Now and then Toussaint paused, weighing one phrase
against another, and once he even glanced at Maillart, but did not ask his opinion. He had
not yet recovered his fallen hat and the yellow madras seemed to throb with the heat of
his concentration.

Maillart wondered if someone might have turned a spyglass on him from the fleet,
an admiral, perhaps Bonaparte’s brother-in-law Leclerc, who was rumored to command
the military force. What would it matter if they were watching? he thought. They won’t
know what they’ re looking at.

Riau was melting wax in a small flame; Toussaint ground his ring down on the
seals.

“Guiaou, Coachy,” he called sharply. Then, after a pause, “Guerrier.” The three

For a moment Maillart’s eyes locked with Riau’s. Well, he thought, have I got the
real dispatch or the decoy? He had already dropped the letter into an inside pocket. He
had been in a number of battles with Riau, and trusted him as much as any man of any
color.

“But yourself, sir?” Maillart said. Toussaint had left himself no escort with these
orders, not even a pair of heralds.

Toussaint had picked up his round hat and jammed it back on his head. He folded

his arms across his chest, took one deep breath, and exhaled through his nostrils so
