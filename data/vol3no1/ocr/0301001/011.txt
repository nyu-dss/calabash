his urging, Bel Argent swung out into a gait so swift and smooth that the white horse
seemed a different order of being from the other horses expected to follow him. Maillart
was proud enough of his own horsemanship and also thought well of his mount, a strong
bay gelding he’d named Eclair as much for its speed as for the lightning blaze in the
center of its forehead. But the best he could manage was to hold his pace a length or two
behind Riau’s mount-- that same blue roan that Toussaint had broken just three days
before.

Toussaint and the white warhorse had been out of sight for half an hour by the
time Maillart and Riau rode onto the peninsula above Samana Bay. His round hat with its
plume and cockade lay on the ground, and Bel Argent stood by him, reins slipped under
stirrup, huffing and flanks heaving with the strain. Riau slipped down and went at once to
Bel Argent and began to walk the big horse in a long looping circuit to cool him down. It
was utterly unlike Toussaint to leave an overheated horse standing. Maillart began to
walk Eclair, with Riau’s mount on the other side, which was awkward since the blue roan
kept trying to reach across his chest to bite the bay. Meanwhile, the rest of the honor
guard gradually grew from dots in the middle distance; at last they came trotting out onto
the point. The men dismounted, muttering to each other and their horses. No one dared to
approach Toussaint, who stood at the cliffs edge, observing the mouth of Samana Bay
with a folding brass spyglass. Every so often he lowered the instrument and polished the
lenses on the tail of his coat, then raised it to his eye again with a disbelieving shrug.

Maillart passed Eclair reins to Guiaou, and led the blue roan toward Riau, who
stood still holding Bel Argent, a respectful ten paces in back of Toussaint. The white
stallion snorted, shook off a fly. Its breathing had calmed considerably. Toussaint turned
his back to the sea.

“Get ready to die,” he said. His face was grey. “All France has come against me.”
He passed one hand across his mouth and added, in a steadier voice, “They have come
back to enslave the blacks.”

Maillart lifted the glass from Toussaint’s slack finger and pulled the telescoping
joints to their full extension. The messenger had not been quite accurate in what he said,
for the ships had not actually entered the bay, but stood at a good distance off the point.
At that distance it was hard to ascertain their number, Maillart kept losing count, but he

thought there must be between thirty and forty.
