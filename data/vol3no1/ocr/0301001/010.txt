change of headgear altered his appearance considerably, though of course Bel Argent was
almost as recognizable, nowadays, ad his rider.

By the end of that day they'd reached the town of Santiago, occupied by the
mulatto general Clervaux and garrisoned by about half of the four thousand black troops
who were posted this side of the border-- the rest were in the hands of Toussaint’s brother
Paul, in Santo Domingo City to the south. At Santiago there was no feast to mark their
arrival-- Maillart and the guardsmen were left to forage, which they accomplished with a
fair success. Toussaint was closeted with Clervaux for a long time, their candles burning
deep into the night, with no one else invited to their council, white or black. Next
morning they were off at dawn, riding eastward along the River Cayman into the wide
expanses of the Consilanza Valley. The are was sparsely populated with Spanish
cattleman and their few black retainers, who were nothing so numerous as on the French
side of the island. The Spanish herdsmen stood in their doorways or turned in their
saddles to stare at the passage of Toussaint’s guard, with never hail or a greeting. Black
rule was not popular in these parts, though it hardly seemed to have much effect on those
who lived here. Maillart had never been so deep into Spanish Santo Domingo, and the
vast plain struck him as desolate, though the grass was lush and green, seedheads flowing
knee-high on men well-mounted as they were.

They sought no civilized shelter that night, but camped out in the open, beating
down the grass to spread their bed rolls and hobbling the horses, that they would not
founder on the usually rich pasture here. To Coachy’s great delight he was given leave to
fell and butcher one of the half wild grazing steers; there was boeuf marron that night to
everyone’s content. Toussaint scrupulously sent a gold portugaise to the nearest hatte, in
payment for this meat they’d requisitioned. Next morning they rode out as the first mist
was rising from the dew-bowed grass, swinging down toward the pass through the
mountains which would bring them through to Santo Domingo City on the south coast.
But before they had begun the ascent, a rider bore down on them from one of the north
coast observation posts. He was breathless, with his horse in a lather, and before he was
well within earshot he began to shout that many, many ships were gathering at the mouth
of Samana Bay.

It was then that Maillart had it confirmed that how much more a horse could

count than its rider. Not that he would belittle Toussaint’s abilities in the saddle. But at
