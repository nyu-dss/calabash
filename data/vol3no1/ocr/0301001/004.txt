file, but no worse than aboard La Sirene. The Army officers grew edgier by the day,
however, as Daspir’s private stock of brandy dwindled down toward nothing.

One pearlescent dawn Placide happened to be standing by when a sailor fishing of
the leeward side of the ship snagged a waterlogged branch, from whose crotch there
flowed a trailing orchid, waxen yellow bulbs sealed and pickled in the salt. The Army
officers appeared and passed the flower from hand to hand, admiring it, noising it for
scent, which it had none. But afterward, as the sun broke water to the east, Daspir
remained standing near Placide at the rail, tilting his face to the warmth and flaring his
nostrils in the western breeze.

“T have heard that the rum of Saint Domingue is very wonderful,” he said.

“Tt has been so long,” Placide said, somewhat coldly. “I don’t remember.” In fact
he had been forbidden to drink rum by his father, though once he had made himself drunk

the air,” he said. “Do you not think--” He broke off and raised his arm to a point. “Look,
look there.”

Placide squinted but there was nothing to see on the western horizon but a low
bank of cloud.

“Birds,” Daspir, breathed out, as if in rapture. Then Placide saw something
swirling up from the cloud bank, a smoke-like current of vaguely moving specks.
Someone else had shouted indistinctly from the bow.

“Land birds, they are,” Daspir said, and turned on Placide a growing smile. “I am

certain of it-- and the land cannot be far.”

In the early afternoon Major Maillart, riding in the midst of a squad of Toussaint’s
honor guard, reached the crossing of the roads to Ouaniminthe and Fort Liberté. Here an
ancient woman sat beneath a rickety shelter made of crooked sticks and broad flat leaves,
with rows of green coconuts and bananas spread on the ground before her. These

comestibles must have been carried some distance, since an almost treeless plain
