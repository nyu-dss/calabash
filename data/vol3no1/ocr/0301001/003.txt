Placide looked toward the western horizon, nudged Isaac when he saw the black curve of
a dorsal fin break water.

For twenty minutes the porpoises swam and leapt around the Jean Jacques and La
Siréne, circling the ships with their flat tails flogging the water, jumping so high
sometimes that their whole bodies left the waves to be outlined against the sky. M.
Coisnon, looking much more confident now that the broad deck of the larger ship was
under his feet, reappeared to tell them how Dionysus, Greek god of wine, had turned the
pirates who would kidnap him into dolphins. It was a bright moment for the three of
them, but a few minutes after the porpoises dove without resurfacing, Placide noticed the
boat returning from La Siréne, loaded down this time with Guizot, Cyprien, Paltre, and
Daspir.

His heart regained its weary weight. Till this moment he had not realized how

or still worse sometimes looks of pity.

Now Placide would not meet Isaac’s eyes. One after another the four officers
came grunting and clambering over the railing.... Though they’d said nothing to one

bring word of this expedition to their father. But in the event it was La Siréne that put on
sail and left them behind, hastening to Guadeloupe, as they were told, with orders of the
government.

One day after another slipped down behind the stern of the Jean-Jacques. Since
putting out from Brest, the fleet had been scattered by some bouts of heavy weather. It
was after the last of these storms that Isaac had made his complete recovery from mal de
mer. But also the last storm had blown several of the squadrons out of touch with one
another. Placide did not know if they were ahead or behind the main body of the fleet but
he was aware that he was no longer anxious for the voyage to end.

There was no special accommodation for them on the Jean-Jacques, the officers
quarters and cabins of choice having already been claimed by others. Placide and Isaac

swung in hammocks with the ordinary seamen, and slept the better for it. The food was
