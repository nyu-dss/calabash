Toussaint wiped away his smile with a hand and looked at Maillart closely. In the
truth it had been a heart-stopping moment for the major. As in the case of many French
officers in a similar position, Maillart felt an almost strictly personal loyalty to Toussaint:
the prospect of any of his black subordinates succeeding him was enough to give him one
uneasy pause.

“Oh,” said Toussaint, “if I make a brief return to the work of my youth, it is only
for a moment’s refreshment.” The smile flashed again, the disappeared. By then they had
come to the edge of the corral. Toussaint dismounted, stroke the neck of his gentled
horse, clucked his tongue reprovingly when the roan tossed its head wt his touch. He
passed the reins to a barechested groom. Who’d appeared, smiling, beside him, nodded to
Maillart and the others, and walked up the slope towards the cluster of low buildings
above the corral.

A couple of hours of daylight remained, and Maillart spent them watching the
horse-breaking. He was offered a try at the game himself, but declined it. He might have
ridden one of these animals to submission in an enclosure, but that mad dash downriver
was not for him. The method certainly did work, however, and no one seemed to get
killed in the process, though one man was thrown to the grassy verge, and some time
spent recapturing the horse with the lariat. Riau, who’d worked under Toussaint long ago
as a slave on Bréda plantation. Took a horse out and brought it back tamed. Guiaou was
offered the same opportunity, but only ducked his head, teeth tight in a grin, and slid
down the fence rail closer to Maillart.

They dined rather splendidly that evening, though in the open air. Chairs and
tables were set out on the grass, and platters brought from the kitchen fires. In that cool
altitude there were no insects to annoy them and they had fine view of the evening
settling on the mountains across the river. Wild pig had been roasted on the boucan,
garnished with baked fruit and supplemented by rice and brown beans and a rich
callaloo. Maillart fell on the food with enthusiasm, ravenous after the long day’s ride. All
thought of Le Cap and the people who lived there was now far from his mind. Toussaint,
he noticed, ate less sparingly than usual, taking a fair portion of meat and a bowlful of
callaloo, along with his usual bread and whole fruits. He must have one of the old women
he trusted to cook for him tucked away nearby. But when the rum went around he let it

pass, drinking only cool water drawn from a spring above the atte.
