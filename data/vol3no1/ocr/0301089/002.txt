RE: JOHN

I’m sitting by my open window
writing in the summer sun;
John is in his dark bedroom

in white-poppied sleep

that lifts him above the pain.

He was such a good patient,

did everything the doctors said

3 chemotherapy trials,

3 chemotherapy failures.

77 pounds melted like clarified butter;
swallowing a tuna sandwich

had become the day’s challenge.

Now finally closed that neck-port,
emptied that obedient vein.

We’re huddled around the word
hospice, the comfort of

padded slippers

and gray-lady whispers....
