As I placed the apron over my head she began speaking to me,
as she had spoken to my mother and all my aunts —-
as my Great Grandmother had spoken to her and all her sisters:
“Here in Jamaica, there is never the dream of a white Christmas
therefore, the pudding is not served hot.
Housewives make one mixture: bake a portion for the cake,
steam the remainder for the pudding.
Raisins, currants, and stoned prunes
should have been soaking for months
in real Jamaican rum cut by port wine.
Spice may be added:
vanilla and almond flavoring,
but this is not a must.
Fruits must be soaked in a glass jar
With a tight fitting lid; avoid using
plastic containers.
And,” she paused, before continuing,

“Always measure what you do.”

As I stood in the kitchen that first time

doing what I knew I would be doing all my life,
surrounded by the ambiguities of my childhood:
a father long gone, a mother

unavailable to me, I could feel my grandmother
rise and to take up space in me, and I knew

she was giving me something to take out

into the world: something I would pass on.
