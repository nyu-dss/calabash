RECIPE

For your grandmother

That time of the year when the days are shorter, darker
and cooler, when the Poinsettia, fire plant,

its leaves incredibly red, surrounding

and protecting the less conspicuous flower;

was when my grandmother’s brick oven

became more active than usual,

as grandmother prepared for that day,

Glorious 1s what she called it,

when all of us children

would be dressed in white,

in observance

of the birth of her lord and savior.

The year I turned ten I started growing into my father’s
long arms and legs, his light eyes, his burnished
brown complexion. I awoke

one morning to an ache in my stomach,

a crimson spot darkening my underwear.

That Christmas grandmother called me into her kitchen --—
walls blackened by soot;

well-scrubbed silver pots dangling from the roof,
Constant smell of pine and hickory.

She handed me, as an early present, a simple
white cotton apron she had stayed up all night,

by the light of the kerosene lamp, to make.
