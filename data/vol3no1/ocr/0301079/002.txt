GAUGIN

jor

One day he just up and stepped out of the life he was living: The big, blond, Danish wife,
the children, the job --- Agent de Change --- in Paris.

One day he just decided to follow something that had long been calling and calling. Let
me be clear here: I am not saying that what Gaugin did

was correct --- abandoning one’s wife, one’s children --- I would not have wanted to be
Mette-Sophie'’. 1 am not even saying that this was the only way to follow

one’s vision out into the world. And I am not talking here about the young Tahitian girls
--- Teha’amana, the two, sitting in the foreground of Te Rerioa ;

and the girls (long dead) who we will forever ask, When Will You Marry? Their faces,
full blown hibiscus flowers; taut plump dark bodies, every man’s

not-so-secret fantasy. No, I am not saying that this was right either.
But what I am asking you, is if you’ve never come upon something so darkly

exciting running through the purple-blue veins of your pure Kurdish blood? What
passions, if any, flow beneath the surface of your unruffled olive skin?
