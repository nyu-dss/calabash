“Hello Milton!” she say. “You the only person I ain’t seen since I been going
through this ordeal.” I mumble something bout being busy and tried to get away but the
woman wouldn’t let me go. “What you trying to do, avoid me?”

I told her, “No. Not exactly.”

“Then sit down and talk to me. Here, let’s go over to Radley’s. I'll buy you some
coffee.”

We went into Radley’s. The place was nearly empty. We both had coffee and I
had some pastry as well. As soon as we sit down she went right into it. Didn’t wait for
