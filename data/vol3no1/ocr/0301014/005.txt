“T thought that you was here for Carnival.”

“T was but I think the excitement get to be too much for me. So I’m going back
home.

“Well, that’s a shame,” I told her. “I told her. “It woulda been nice to take you
around for a little bit, but have a good trip.” She thank me and she left. And I watch her
walk away thinking,” ... ... Why do I always have to have such bad luck? But there was
nothing to do so I just shrug and forget it.

Carnival come and as usual it was big, crazy and colorful. Every year it get
bigger and bigger with more people coming in, more floats, more events, more
everything. Every year it wilder too, and this year was no exception. Things just rush by
in a blur and when was over, the whole island was a mess. Clean up from all of this
sometimes takes a month. But they say it’s good for business. Tourist business. It
pouring the island on the map.

I think I remember seeing Brooks one time in all of that noise. He was drinking
and smiling and we said “Hello” to one another.

The next thing I’m hearing is that Brooks is dead and the police got Marva in jail
for shooting him. They say she tried to shoot Joycelyn, too, but the young woman got
away and nobody know where she is. Not even the police.

I went to the funeral and it was Brooks alright. He was lying there in the coffin,
hands over his chest, dead as a rock.

A week later, Marva was out the street on bail. People said they shouldn’t let her
out unsupervised like that because the woman might run away to escape punishment. But
Marva said, “I ain’t going a damn place. I stayinig right her and telling my story for
everybody to hear.”

For weeks after she got out I did everything I could to avoid running into her on
the street. I didn’t want to see the woman, hear the woman, know the woman. She had
killed somebody I called friend and no matter what her explanation was, I couldn’t like
her for it.

I was successful in avoiding her, too. More successful than anybody has a right to
be on an island this small. Then one day as I was walking into the Post Office, I bump

smack into she walking out.
