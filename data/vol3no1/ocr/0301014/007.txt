the one who had to bail him out. My lawyers used to tell me not to do it. But I used to
ask them, “How could I refuse? The man is my husband.”

“In the last four or five months, I have to admit things was going better with us.
For a long time Brooks didn’t want to do any sex business with me, then all of a sudden
he wanted to do it every night. At first I thought that maybe he was up to some trick.
Brooks wasn’t above using anything to get his way. But after a while, I got to believing
he was really sincere. You used to see us, so you know I ain’t lying. For a time there we
was like a honeymoon couple. And we was even talking about taking a vacation
together. Something we haven’t done in years. It was like I was dealing with a new man
and I open up my whole self to him. I cancelled all the loan debts that he had with me,

was a child. Her mother, Jane, and I used to go to school together. Brooks was against it
saying it was going to interfere with our privacy. But I insist and finally he gave in.

From the minute they met at the airport, I shoulda seen there was something going
on. Brooks and Joycelyn didn’t know each other before, but the minute they shake hands
a kind of chemistry begin to happen between them. I shoulda knowed it. I shoulda
sensed it and I think I did, but I paid it no mind. I mean, here’s a girl twenty and a man
forty four. Even if he tried, you wouldn’t think a girl like that would be interested in a
