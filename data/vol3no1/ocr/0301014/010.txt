business with Joycelyn delay him. He got himself caught up in something he didn’t
expect. He had this young girl opening up her legs for him and he couldn’t get enough of
it.

“So, now it was my turn to act. And I gon tell you, Milton, tell you plain, this was
when I decided I was going to kill his ass. I sat there and thought about it and I said to
myself, ‘If that pistol is still in his briefcase, ’'m going to take it out and shoot him with
it. ’'m going to put a bullet in his behind and that will end this thing once and for all.’ I
went and I look and there it was. The gun that was meant for me was the one that I

waited. It wasn’t till late when they got back. But I was there and I was waiting. I got

The court was called and they argued for a week. Temporary insanity with
mitigating circumstances. After eighteen hours of deliberation, the jury came back with a
verdict of “Not guilt.” ... People in the court cheered and Marva went out of that place a
free woman.

Six months later she was married again. This time not to an island fellow but to
an American. People say if he misbehave, Marva will put a bullet in him, too. But the
man, George, is quiet and look like he don’t know how to misbehave so everything is
fine.

About a year later, I found out that one of the things Marva told me that morning
