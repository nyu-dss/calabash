me back home and then he would double back and pick her up. Which is what he did.
He pick her up and took her to some motel room where the two of them spend hours an
hours together. When he come home that night it was late. When I ask where he had
been, he said he was out in the country with some friends, including you.

“For three days of Carnival, I hardly see the man. When I ask him where he was,
he would get mad and tell me to stop being so possessive. It was like he was going back
to being the old Brooks all over again. I didn’t want that so I stopped saying anything.

They mighta got away with it if one of my customers didn’t tell me she seen
Joycelyn in some restaurant that morning having breakfast. I told her it couldn’t be. That
Joycelyn had gone back home. But the woman who only met Joycelyn once was sure she
had seen her. When I mention it to Brooks, he said it Brooks, he said it was impossible.
Said that Dora didn’t know who she was seeing.

“Later that day the Devil in my mind told me, ‘Watch Brooks close—he up to
something. Don’t let him see that you watching. But watch the sonofabitch close.’ And
that’s what I did. I let him leave the house and then I followed the skunk dog bastard. I
stayed a good distance out of the way but I kept him in sight and I followed the bastard
everywhere he went. That’s how I found out where he was keeping that little whore. At
the Bindley Motel out in the country. I watch them walk round the country road holding
hands and kissing. I watch them go into the room and remain there for hours. And I
watch them get in his car, the car I pay for and drive to all kinds of places.

“When I couldn’t watch it no more, I went back home. I couldn’t believe that
man and what he was doing. I couldn’t believe that bitch, either. She had been a guest in
my house and that’s what she was doing with my husband.

“Then it come to me. That gun Brooks had, he was planning to shoot me with it.
This was before Joycelyn come into the picture. He had some kind of plan and it
involved the gun. That’s why he was being so nice and got me to sign all those papers
and everything. Then he was going to put a bullet in my brain and that would be it. I
don’t know how I know it but I will swear on a pile of Bibles that that’s what the man
had in his mind. And he was probably planning to do it during Carnival. He could say
that he though I was a burglar or that he was drunk or something. People know that all

kinds of craziness go on during Carnival. This coulda been one of them. But I think this
