money. I know she will, and try to put me in jail or worse if I can’t pay. Marva can be
damn vengeful and evil when she put her mind to it.”

“So what you planning to do?”

“T don’t know. But I got to do something. I know that for sure. I can’t go on like
this. Something got to change.” He look so down in the mud that I felt sorry for him, but
there was nothing I could do and I told him so.

“T didn’t expect you to do nothing,” he said. “I just needed somebody to talk it
out to. Somebody who could understand and maybe even sympathize.”

That was the only conversation we had on that subject. Then for three or four
months after that it look like things was getting back good with him and his wife. You
would see them a lot of places together, laughing and acting lovey dovey. I was glad to
see it. Because I don’t like divorce and I don’t like to see people I know in pain. I didn’t
ask any questions, of course, because none of it was any of my business. But inside I
was glad they was working it out.

It was one week before Carnival. Marva had a young woman come to visit with
her Brooks. The woman was some kind of friend or distant family. I don’t remember.
But I remember the first time I see her all I wanted to do was jump on her. The young
woman’s name was Joycelyn and she had a mouth so big that when she laughed it looked
like she could swallow up the moon. And everything about her was soft and creamy and
sweet, sweet, sweet. I had my own girlfriend but I still was interested in giving her a try.
After all, it was Carnival. And Carnival is the time to try any kind of recklessness you
might have in mind. So I talked to Brooks about it. “Try her if you like,” he told me.
“But I think she engaged to be married to some fellow back where she come from.” I ask
other questions bout the woman, but he say he didn’t know much. “Joycelyn was
Marva’s friend and house guest. They talk to one another a lot. I just try to be pleasant
and polite.”

Then, after being in Joycelyn’s presence two or three times with and Brooks, I run
into her by herself on the street. I engage her in conversation, then ask her if she would
like to have dinner or maybe go to a dance or something with me. She told she would
love it and was pleased that I asked. But she was going back to where she come from

that very next day. I was surprised at that Carnival was only two days away.
