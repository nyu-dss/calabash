in Radley’s was a lie. We was doing some business having to do with bringing in some
merchandise for a store I had a small financial interest in. During our conversation, it
came out hta he was the one who had sold Marva the pistol. The one she had used to kill
Brooks. This man didn’t know anything about the case because he was away. But he
was wondering if I could use a weapon similar to the one he had sold to Marva two years
before. Just a little something to keep around the house for my own protection. I told
him no, but I asked him again about the one he sold to Marva. I wondered if he had to
right woman. ‘Oh yes,’ he told me. ‘Woman own the Star Beauty Hair Dressing place.
Mavis something is her name.’ I told him Marva. ‘Oh yes, that’s right. Marva.
Marrried to a sonofabitch from what I could make out.’ I told him that husband was dead.
‘Then she better off,’ he said. I told him yes she was.

Later that evening, I looked at an old calendar. According to the captain, she had
bought that pistol eight months before Brooks was shot. It put a whole new complexion
on things. And it gave me a whole new view of Marva. I used to think she was just a

good business woman. Now I can see she is more than that. A whole lot more.
