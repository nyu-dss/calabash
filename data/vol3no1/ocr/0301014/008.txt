a fellow back home she was planning to marry. See what I’m saying? So even when my
instincts told me things, I ignored them. Like one night after dinner, we was all having
fun, the three of us. Suddenly Brooks said he was tired and he want to go home. It was
only a little after nine and Brooks is a man who usually like to stay up till two and three
in the morning. He say we could stay, but we said no. We would turn in, too.

“When we got back to the house, Brooks went right to sleep. Wasn’t interested in
sex or nothing. I went to sleep, too. Round one o’clock I woke up and Brooks was gone.
I looked around and he wasn’t in the kitchen or living room either. I was about to go

because Brooks was in a hurry to get some place and we was only using one car. Mine
was in the shop for repairs. I even said I would stay and take a taxi back home. But
Joycelyn said that wouldn’t be necessary. She would be fine. So Brooks and I went
back. He drop me home and rushed off to his appointment.
