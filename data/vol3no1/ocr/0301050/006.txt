Uncle John Frank can’t shoot. I too close. He swing de gun like a club, but I

gone already and he bash in headman nose. I drop headman two cheek in de dirt and fly

away.

Dey leave Mommy and Daddy tie up dere in de dirt.

Auntie had done take de body where I used to be and lay it on de selfsame bed I
ain’t want to get up from. She know I dead, and she crying.

Auntie go back and cut de ropes holding Mommy and Daddy down by sheself.
Nobody else would come. She bring water for dem. Blood oozing every time dey draw
breath. Dey eyes open but dey ain’t really seeing. Can’t stand up, can’t sit down, de
whole back adem torn up. Auntie crying, not letting she tears fall on de deep deep cuts.
De Missus in de window watching. And I dere, in de tamarind tree, watching she back.

Auntie bring a bowl a water for me too. She watch me with she face turn
sideways, but she call me by me name. “Come, Clem, drink,” she say and is den I feel to
cry. She know me. Auntie know me. J ain’t self know meself, bound up in feathers with
beak and ting, same bloody as de two whips drop down in de dirt.

I never sleep inna bed again.
