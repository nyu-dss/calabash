job to tie up de cane in bundles. Big piles of cane lay down here and dere and de wagon
man Joseph and me, since I make me seventh birthday, travel up and down de field
gathering dem. All day we go back and forth, hauling what Mommy, Daddy and de other
grown folks cut, all de way to de clear yard by de Massa house near de front road. Is
hard work, but de new Massa say I big enough to do it. De ole Massa die, and he wife
and children all leave when de new Massa come. He come with evil ways Daddy say.
But Mommy say hush, try not to think on dat. But I don’t like looking at de new Massa,
or Missus neither. They skin too paley paley, like this de first dey ever see sun and he
eyes had make me itch. De day he make us line up, de day he tell me I was big enough to
bundle, was de first time I see him close up and he eyes almost clear, like lizard belly,
and I think on de dead lizard I see de day before, covered over with black ants. I start to
scratch and rub, ‘til Mommy pinch me, tell me be still. “Til now he does make me itch
when I see him.

I hear somebody crying. And somebody shushing dem. Coming from down by
de clear yard. I don’t want to go, but me feet take me. Is a long walk dat take only a short
time.

Tain’t look up. Just follow de dusty trail ‘til I reach a circle of ragga skirt hems
almost reaching de ground. Pant leg too. Some short, showing lot of scarred up legs,
some long, dragging in de back like foot have tails. I ‘fraid to look now, what I had want
to find, I ain’t want to see.

Everybody standing tight together. Quiet.

Is not really hot, but I sweating. I start looking for me Mommy, me Daddy,
pushing through de big people. Mommy woulda make me stop pushing and say ‘scuse
me, but I can’t self find she yet. Everybody gather round de two tamarind trees. Dey
stand big in de clear yard, and shade de house. Two a dem, so close together and so big,
dat de high branches all tangle up. Me and Jacko and Maryann does climb to get de ripe
tamarind when Massa not home.

When I done push me way near de front, me Auntie grab me and hold me tight
‘gainst she back. Me chest push up on she butt. She two arms reaching back to hold me

two arms.
