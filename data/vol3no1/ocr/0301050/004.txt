“ ,..don’t care what you did before, but ’m your new master and there will be no
more fornication! Do you understand me? No sex. No men and women laying together.
No sleeping together. No sneaking around at night to get to one another. I’ve told you
this before and I will not tolerate disobedience!”

Me ain’t know what Massa yelling about, but de grown folks ain’t like it. Is like
all a dem just turn to stone. I can’t see nothing but Auntie dress back and I try turn me
head. Nobody say “yes, Massa,” nobody say “no, Massa. No breeze blow, nobody
breathe.

“Now, this one..umh, Audra and this one, Louis, have been caught at...are known
to be... when I want you to breed, goddammit, I will breed you!”

I don’t know what all he say but Audra and Louis is me Mommy and Daddy. I
know Mommy name is Audra, only Daddy does call she dat. ‘Specially at night, so far
night is almost morning, I does hear he calling she Audra ‘steada Sal, what everybody
else call Mommy. Dey does be talking and whispering and making loud soft sounds and
dat’s how I know dat Audra and Louis is Mommy and Daddy.

I getting more frighten now and I need to find dem bad bad. De sun hot on me
head and I ain’t know why Auntie holding me so tight. I can’t self breathe and me legs
feeling like jellyfish look. Ijerk round hard and before Auntie could wrench me back, I
see.

What I see make me head throw back and a scream fly out. So loud and so long I
could feel it. Dat too frighten me and I feel like candle wax, melting into de ground. Is
like de sound alone make into a ting and me insides ripping out.

Tie to de trees, no clothes on, is me Mother. And me Father. De Massa standing
on one side, de headman on de other. Dey gon’ whip them. De whips long long and
brown. Three piece a leather braid up together, de bottom free like feathers. Long time
dey hang on a hook by ole Massa door. De only time I ever see dem move from dere was
when a slobbering, red-eyed dog had come in de yard and everybody chase him down.
Ole Massa had grab de whip den and whoosh it through de air so fast you ain’t sure you

see it. It land on de dog back and bright red blood come out.
