JUMBIE FROM BORDEAUX

I was frighten from de time I wake up. I ain’t trust de way de sun creep over de
top of de mountain, like it sneaking. I ain’t trust de way de chickens crowing, instead of
de sing song dat make me think dey telling jokes, I hear a squawking, kinda bawling, like
ain’t nothing funny. I ain’t want to leave me bed.

But I get up and go outside, round de back. De chickens scatter like dey never see
me before. I put me hand over de coal pot and feel de heat. It have some dough dere on
de side, but it ain’t fry. Where Mommy? Mommy never leave a hot coal pot alone, where
we children could reach. Ain’t Ia child no more? I musta get grown in de night, cause a

child does get breakfast, piece of dumbbread, or johnny cake and I ain’t see none for me.

I strut off to find everybody, hands in me pockets like a big man. Plantation quiet
quiet. Even though I don’t like to get up, I like de morning cause de air smell like it just
bathe. We high up from de sea but when de morning breeze blow it bring de sea smell.
Sometimes I close me eyes, when it blow little hard and is like I feeling de small waves
push me ‘round. Like when we had go down to de sea and Daddy hold me under he arm
like a soggy tree branch and tell me to lay out on de water like is Mommy lap I laying on.
See how nice he tell me, soft and warm. Leave de water hold you up he say. And it did.
I was floating. I jump up to tell Mommy “Look!” and de float gone. Daddy laugh and
grab me again. I float all day feeling de small waves rocking me.

Today not even little breeze blowing. De bad feeling come round again. Dis time

a morning everybody be cutting cane already. I going try meet up with de wagon. Is my
