I see de whip handle in new Massa hand, raise up high over he head. Massa and
headman watch each other, like they gon’ race. De people quiet. ‘Cept for me, I ain’t
stop screaming. Me Uncle, John Frank holding Massa gun.

“Shut dat boy up,” Massa say. He voice like dark cloud holding rain, and Uncle
John Frank point Massa gun at Auntie and me. I see tears rolling down he face.

I still screaming when de first lash come down. Den me Mommy join me. She
call de angels with she mouth, but dey ain’t come. We two voices soaring through de
morning like cutlass. Auntie try cover me mouth with she two hands. Daddy shaking like
fish quiver when it come on land. De lashes falling on me parents bare skin.

De helplessness jump out a me and latch onto something dat could. Is like I fly
right out me own mouth. Went with me own scream and find meself high up in de air,
swooping down from de sky like a stone from a slingshot.

I see de tops of de two tamarind trees and de half circle of people gather round. I
see me Mother and Father stake out on de ground like two pigs for roasting, they brown
bodies looking blurry in de brown dirt. Everybody still but Auntie. She turning round
now, trying to hold me up, but me body fall right down to de ground, heavy like sleep.

Every time de two whips draw back dey smacking leaves off de trees. Leaves
falling like sweat.

I rush at Massa first. I meaning to take out he eye. Gouge out he throat. Snatch
de whip from he hand like I does snatch worm from de dirt.

De whip nearly catch me when I dive in, but I reach he face and try plow me
whole body in through he eye hole. He arm fly up and try bat me away. I feeling stuck in
de mush of he eye and is like sucking mud to try get ‘way. I use me feet to scrabble and
claw. He screaming too now and de lash fall with no force.

I turn and fly at de headman. He watching me come, mouth hanging open,
looking stupid. He gone catch more than flies today.

Massa yelling, clutching he face, “Shoot it! Shoot it, John Frank! Shoot!”

Straight for de headman’s face I go, me talons stretch out like I ready to clutch a
rat. He try raise he whip to me, but it too late, I grab hold of he two cheeks and try

reverse meself and take he flesh with me.
