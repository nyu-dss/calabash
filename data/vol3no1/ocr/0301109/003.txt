within the creamy creation, suck your wine bottle,

evidence of the one vine, damn tangled. My ear against his thigh,

I can hear his blood in a universal rush, like a thirsty millipede, to its creator.
Haunted grapes bite at the back of my head,

two girls, black eyeliner bleeds across their cheeks,

gold hoop earrings shimmer feedback elixir

and the boy unravels into ink sugar rivers. My wings

wrap the air and he, his lap pulsing, leans forward

to gaze into my hot spiraled ear, the stairway getting darker,
deeper into red coals, light inside light â€” the first big mistake.
