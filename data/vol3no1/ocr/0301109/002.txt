PARTY AT THE HOUSE OF ISIS

The boy asked me, What planet are we on?

I said, the one you can poke your finger in a Hostess cupcake

at the same time a woman, wriggled in colors, climbs a spiral staircase,
her vagina smiling beneath a towel

and you can barely leash your own consciousness.

I put my ear to his thigh, his lap hot,

as he leans his head back to kiss the girl

on the sofa wrapped in a red boa. I remember

the initial sting of my fuchsia birth. The swan-throated boy

asks again, What planet? Are you sure? inhale a wild crop of feathers

not daring to cough out — it suddenly occurs to me —

thought blows the paint off, but the iridescent what-is

remains. The Mistress of Ceremonies, in a crossbones sweatshirt,
turns up the speaker, burlap coordinates of chords huff,

with eyes and legs, they run away

and the neon green cage of my imagination
circulates blue electric swans, beaks belled
swarming towards a honey fire, the frame
elaborating itself, collapsing on its own ears.

The girl in crossbones (death) spills her (death) drink

and this is the planet where you say, say, (death), say
that scrumptious word — winged, toothed, scaled —
the lips get cut just saying it — oh! This is the home
of flickering black diamonds, card tricks, bluebirds
and all the hard berries they crave. You dwell
