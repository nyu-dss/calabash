Chorus

Fair well, Attila, learn from your father’s tragic end.

Make a name for yourself through your deeds of righteousness.
Fair well oh gentle breeze, gentle streams, and somber meadows.

Fair well oh hills, valleys where the women of sea men dwell.

I go to the underground hall of shade where the eternal night awaits.

The spirit evaporates into the cursive waves.

The sea speaks of revenge and hate,

lances are drawn by the dark moon and will clash at sunrise
like a din of warriors’ voices unleashed upon the battle field
when the battalion of Lions awake from their slumbering.
For years I mourn the absent King.

His diadem confined to the murky waters.

I awake and already a thousand songs,

A thousand task lies before me.

I awake and it is as if I’ve always been asleep.

l asked for truth and truth was myself

Lost in innocent service to the scornful

retches who murdered my father.

I, a meek and poor poet in a world of deceitful violent men
That schemed and plotted against the seed of Jah.

I the broken instrument from birth,

Will mend myself, for now all that I have is my temple
though defiled by the unrestrained and harsh.

Myself protected from the mighty winds of greed and fascism.

But this the infant shall no more sleep--

Oh, my father, Ghost perpetual— your death is my freedom.
For with your demise comes my enlightenment.

Air, I go, one two three never more to be by the lonely sea.

Maxwell / 99
