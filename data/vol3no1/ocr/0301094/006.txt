with the ambushed police force waiting with bribery
on their lollygagging tongues caused me to abandon the plan.

I fished upon my father’s knees
I knew nothing better than the relentless sea. I had no salt--
Alas the open sea was all.

It was here, after many sorrowful hours that I made the call,

on this megalithic rock with the eye of ages past.

Oh, regret, my new found friend, you caught me with your snare,
your saliva is regret the heirloom of the dead.

Where are their contracts and legal bantering now? —

now that death has so dutifully claimed my flesh.

What law is there that can rival the Lord’s commandments:

the hurricane still threatens our waters, typhoon splits the ship---
All that’s left is Jah’s steadfast judgment: Oh Lord Almighty!
Your edicts never change.

The word of a man to thee is no more than dust and sand.

Chorus: (pleading insistently with the ghost)
Be still O my soul, the spirit has turn to walk away
like the sun on the table of the sea.
Nearer, nearer still—I mean to know my father’s fate.
From childhood hence our name the town disgraced
with neither shame or regret they serve the merchants
selling their children to grand hotels.
Reconcile your loses, father: Where is Justice?
Her redeeming light upon the situation personifies commandments
for wayward mankind so bent on asserting themselves to new sins.
Remember the merchant, who drove you to suicide, his clean-shaven face
whose invasion filled the beaches with hollow bricks
displaced the world we once knew.
He is the villain, not you my father, not you, O’ saint of Fishermen.
Return to your cave, all maladies will ease with dreams.
Your sleep shall fleeting be for to suffer is to gain.
Splendid shall your pain transform from bitter gall to pure sugar upon the
tongue.

Fisherman
Too late, too late—my son for to and fro my journeys I learned the truth--
Who can tell a man, “depart and fish here no longer for the sea was
bought
by a merchant from Venice?” Why do I need permission
to do the work of Jah Almighty and likewise feed my young?
They drove me to an early grave. I allowed my emotions to take sway
and toss my soul upon the sea of my despair.
I took the road to Sheol, and the sin has doomed me--
As living lighthouse my eyes reflects the sea,
I watch day and night with no reprieve.
