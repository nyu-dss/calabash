Let her exonerate the name of an African fisherman
displaced by foreign merchants who speak with seven tongues.
Tell your story my father; let the whole world grieve with you:

Fisherman (painstakingly turning from the sea, wading from the water as if just
returning from a recent expedition)

Old man no more dead,

unearthed poor Dudley from his eternal rest

to revel the mysteries of the dead

to release the heart and mind from bottom of the lung.
Morose, the sickled moon in my lonesome breast—
I’ve seen things my son better left unseen and said,
old years are gathering in me like tulip bulbs.

Still I toil and these shoulders have not rest

for I must haul these fishnets even in death

until released by Jah the ever faithful one,

whose anger | placated with verses you taught me.

Many morns over the sea-sprayed-cliffs

I carried you on my shoulders to the harbor, my beloved son

to greet the be speckled eye in the eastern sky--

to teach you our lineage as only the sun can tell.

Remember those times? The sea sported her barnacled robes

and the seaside town awoke from its ashes like a united school of thought.
With my old Scottish kilt Thermos filled with Blue Mountain coffee
sweetened with condense milk and brown sugar, victuals

and blankets for the overnight sails every man a kiss would bless

upon his lady’s alabaster forehead and off to sea for weeks on end.

Remember bobbing gulls, and narrow fishing skiffs

and countless fishermen singing and stringing bits for bates with
flippancy—

I charged those days unending, paradise achieved on earth

free from exploitation and invaders... tastes of fried crispy snappers

I can remember with tender festivals for starch and strength

under the stones of Lovers Leap I readied my companion to trek the sea.

Ah, the sea that unravels all sailors’ knots.

Alpha and Omega she who spawned life

and takes men souls to shallow graves.

Remember the fisherman, attend, and resurrect a faithful servant
who rode upon the crest of distant waters.

I left wife and child furlongs behind.

I abandoned the pit of my boat with fishhooks and snares.

Here I alone stand, the lighthouse my sole companion.

Cheated out of life because of my potential earning.

Alas, my self-pity is without warrant, my tears undone.

I cannot rightly blame any man for the burning flames about me.
I alone braced the bulk of the heavy chains
