A FISHERMAN’S TALE

Pious gulls feeding at the boatswain’s hands

while he sings falsetto notes:

lend me your feathery lobes --bring idle wings to bare

on the prow of our land—jurors of the sea, witnesses to the trial
of a wounded spirit...for it is you alone who can judge

aright and distinguish justice from human cruelty.

I am the son of Dudley, the silent mariner of Boscobel.

And on this day the anniversary of my father’s death

Iam drawn to this part of Salem, near the white-capped waves
To rekindle crimes ostracized from land into sea.

And in this hour, the Merchants of Venice do cower

for their time is short; their immoral exploits stitched

into the fabric of the hegemony has taken flesh to dwell among men.

Demon or man? I hear a howl as if from a lion’s lair.

And now upon the scene,

sharp as a wounded knee a shipwrecked god--

the ecclesiastical pariah, the ghost misfortune leads by a collar,
bound to the lonesome murmuring of the sea, hobbles upon the sand.
Beware O’ Kinsmen! A terrible horror he becomes --

Slow and deliberate like a forlorn gull at Rio Buenos.

Once my father’s spirit strove with saffron foam.

His stubborn breed once spread from coast to coast--

Head of our village he spoke the foreigners dialect.

He had sun burnt cheeks that were serious in the wind.

Over his shoulder the old fishnet he carried.

Leather sandals bound his toes, and the khaki trousers tightly girt his
hips.

Silence O air, silence O cantankerous sea! The spirit is upon me—

The ghost shall sing a threnody to notify us of past ills.

He has come to judge the wicked exploiters of a poor fishing village—
