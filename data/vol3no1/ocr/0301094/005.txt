when our shores were divided among the foreign merchants.

At first we schooled together, fishermen of every creed, and sort,
but most took the money and the penance that came with it.
They left the shores of patrimony, left the shores without piety.
But I sore to drink the wine dark sea

than abandon the shores my fathers left to me.

I could not fish the sea; I could not fold my net upon the sand

neither could I clean the snares or bait the hooks.

The beach to sterility went they combed it day and night

removed all its vestments, cast them into the wind and built a fence of
lead.

There were no room for fishing; trees assembled

brave as watriors ready to do battle with tractors

but soon they too were uprooted and in their place

stood Hedonism II, Sanders Resort and Nudist colonies--

idols permeated the sand, our food harvested to feed Bacchus ritual.

One night an expedition I sought to undertake was foiled.

My ancestral boat, Nanny of the Sea, was by strangers taken

and ravished like a maiden in the company of perverted solders.

Nowhere in sight was she, “Nanny” I begged the night,

I cursed the moon, and for the first time blasphemed against the sea.

I was going to kill and do evil things to the enemy that raped my Nanny.

Soon I learned the merchants’ hired hands were to blame.

I took my cutlass and off to their pavilion I marched

demanding justice or the price of their heads.

To the owners of Hedonism II, the corporate robber barons

in their doubled breasted suits in the heat of our yellow sun

did I carry the righteous speech in my heart and mind.

They rejected my claims and offered me conversion by money.

It came to blows—I severed an arm and ten toes.

They beat me out of town naked as Adam.

I ran for cover in the bush of Salem.

In the dire streets your parent roamed, disheveled

and induced with sorrow and dread. Unrecognized by shipmates

and land bound folks—to see the disgust upon their faces

making dyer boldfaced accusations.

I meant to flee and never again return to the scene.

At first I took the homebound path, and the sight of your mother weeping
