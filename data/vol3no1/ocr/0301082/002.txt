A CONVERSATION WITH MY GRANDMOTHER

My father, your great grandfather,
no, he was not an Irish man
Like you say he told you. Rather ---

He was an Englishman from somewhere in Hanover.

I don’t know, I don’t know,

all these questions that you keep asking,

all these questions you are forever asking ---
I never knew my father’s parents,

When my father married my mother,

a dark-skinned woman,

They were none too pleased about this.
My father met my mother

On a visit to his sister in Nonsuch.

See --- you had it the other way around,
his sister coming to visit him.

You must have known his sister as a child,

she who married a black man, and,
like her brother, was never welcomed back
to the family fold. These things happened

along time ago. Jamaica was very different then.
