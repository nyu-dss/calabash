“This year going to be a bumper year, I have several thousand in orders already.

“Whew.” She whistled.

Silence.

“About the cleaning for Christmas.”

“What about it?”

“T miss the children.”

“And?”

“T sneak out everyday when he gone out on business till the day before Christmas
Eve. I fix up the house for you.”

“The catch?”

“You bring up the children for Christmas. Your parents too. If they wish to
come.”

“You coming?”

“You know I can’t do that. I have to stay home to entertain he friends.”

She let out a shrill laugh after her statement. It was a laugh of understanding, of
being relegated from lover, to lady of the house, to servant.

“Yeah, I have to entertain he friends.” She said it ruefully.

He wanted to say no to her request, to hurt her, to hate, but he couldn’t. The most
he could mutter was neutrality.

“O.K.”

“T starting now.”

She leaped off the barrel and passed her hand over her bottom to dust it.

He pretended not to notice.

Over the days the layers of Christmas that he had once recalled from memory
returned. The smell of cleanliness and paint, the heady scent of cask wine and the earthy
smell of the dirt oven being built, the sweet smell of flowers and the crisp newness of
curtains.

On the day before Christmas Eve, the grand finale, the scent of freshly baked cake
and sweetbread.

After she had removed them from the oven she went outside to sit on the front

steps.
