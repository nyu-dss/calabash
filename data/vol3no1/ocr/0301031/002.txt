SURROUNDED BY FIREFLIES

Manuel sat on the steps of his house and looked out into the cocoa fields that
stretched far down into the valley. Christmas was not far away, and in the past the scent
and feeling of Christmas would have pervaded the old house in which he lived before
moving up into the hills.

It was five years since Rachel had left, and since the scents of Christmas were
linked to her preparations, when she left, she took her Christmas activities with her and
so the aura of Christmas had faded away.

He felt Rachel’s presence before he saw her.

“T hear thinking about Christmas, and thought that it was because of that my mind
was playing tricks on me.” He said to her, explaining his initial belief that his
reminiscence of Christmas had somehow included her in the scenario.

She sat down on the first step, so that her back was to him. Looking down at her
he realized that her attractiveness was still there and it brought back to him his hurt.

“What you want?” he asked gruffly.

“Good morning. You see I haven’t lost my manners yet.”

“You lose more than what that when you leave.”

“T didn’t come here to quarrel.”

“Who quarreling? You hear me raise my voice?”

“How the children?

Skillfully she deflected the tone and direction of their conversation.
