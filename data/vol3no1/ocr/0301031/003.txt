“They adjust well to my parents, they doing all right. Why you stop visiting
them?”

“They cry too much when I leaving and I don’t like to give them that hurt. You
know I can’t take them with me, he don’t want no other man children round he.”

“He don’t know is yours too?”

She stayed silent for a while.

“He only tell me that after.”

She got up and walked over to an empty overturned water barrel that lay just
beyond the steps. Using one hand to lever herself onto the barrel so that she was sitting,
facing him. Her face was different. Sad almost, although her forced gaiety attempted to
hide it.

“T thought you had another woman by now.” She said to him.

“T done with that for a while. Too much stress.”

“T know what you mean.”

“So,” he muttered to himself, “trouble in paradise.”

He did not ask any questions, not wishing to give her the idea that he was in any
way interested in what was taking place in her life.

They were both silent.

The silence was taut, like a spider’s web with a struggling insect, and then she
broke it.

“You not cleaning for Christmas?”

“No,” he stretched out the ‘o’ so that it became a long drawn out syllable.

“Ts just me, what I cleaning up for, not even my friends does come up so high in
the woods. I does have to go down by them when I need company. Besides, you know,
business.”

“Yeah.” She laughed.

He had a thriving bush rum trade here on the estate, and business boomed during
the Christmas season. He had a reputation for producing high quality bush rum, and
wishing to maintain his good reputation, he always remained close to his stills, tending

his product continuously.
