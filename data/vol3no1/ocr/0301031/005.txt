He leaned over the bottom half of the door to look down upon her, opening the
conversation.

“You still not coming? The children and my parents decide you know. They
coming. My parents old, they say they would like the quiet. The children, they always
like it here. They looking forward to it.”

Silence.

“Why then?” he asked.

“What?”

“The cleaning, you know, everything.”

“You don’t get it yet?” she replied.

She paused, and then continued.

“So they will know.”

“Know what?”

His confusion was genuine.

“That I here, I spending the Christmas with them.”

They both remained silent for a while.

“Look,” she said, pointing down into the cocoa fields, “the fireflies are coming
out. I have to go.”

“So long,” he said, “thanks and Merry Christmas.”

“Merry Christmas.” Came her reply as she walked off down the dirt track, flanked

by the cocoa trees, and surrounded by fireflies.
