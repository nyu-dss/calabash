sun blown faces of the homeless; a little girl transports sand
in two hour-glass fists spilt by wind;

a father's white blouse ripples after her.

A yellow-green shell, a slim radiant,

flashes and I almost lose it in the infinite

shades of beige and I remember my first memory:

two years old, Justin and I holler and chase down waves

and turn from the pelted tide towards our parents

with their fire and pan-fried fish. Mom and Dad are surrounded
by a half circle of dark blue and purple oysters,

shells the shape of tongues pressed into the sand bar

and I say, God, I don't care if I believe in you,

just hold me tonight, no strings attached;

sing me my dead love songs,
then hush me, the moon's child, asleep on a morning bird.
