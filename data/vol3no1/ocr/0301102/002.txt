MORNING BIRD

I'm flying through cloud cradles on the red-eye.

A stewardess finally clicks off the overheads.

I pretend I'm a character in a book - - everything suddenly curious:
week-old crackers in my pocket; crackers from the funeral home,

where my brother, Justin, and I stopped for split pea

remembering how alive Dad looked, a damn smile even - -

turbulence persuades me to open my eyes.

The wing stretches from my shoulder, wing-lights streak

gray marblings across its span into the indigo atmosphere.

I don't know what to call my life - - sailing

from evening to dawn in four short hours.

Earlier, I met new people in a glass-pipe head-shop:

we drank Chai tea and remembered our separate childhood
family vacations under clear stars; I ate a pancake, warm as a face

and we tried to name the moons of the solar system: Europa, Callistro, Miranda,

Triton, Charon. I left to watch the sunset on the beach
and had the feeling I could forget everything: the urgent

train ride home, relatives from Canada, their hands on my shoulders,

his cold forehead, five feet of snow and falling.
I am on the beach, I told myself, swarmed by painters and incense:

Chronic, Mango, Jungle Love; Surreal nude angles; palm trees dabbed on a spoon;
