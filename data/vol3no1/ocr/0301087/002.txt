CITY BLACKOUT

No streetlights,

a few candle-muted windows,
without electronic amusements
night comes closer

in New York;

stores shutter early;

neighbors cluster on stoops;
sudden firecracker bursts

and little-boy cheers

dare the dark;

the airâ€™s a thick tent-
camels munching desert shrubs,
Bedouins around the fire.

I look out;
tell time with the stars.
