STILL IN THE CHICKEN COOP:
A CONVERSATION WITH VISUAL ARTIST
DEBORAH GRANT

I met Deborah Grant at her debut exhibition at The Scene Gallery back in 2003 the
show’s curator was Koan Jeff Beysa. Deborah’s medium is oil on canvas. Her paintings
are usually massive in scale 6 by 14 feet, displayed on hanging canvases, birch panels
and chalk boards measuring 24 by 18 inches. Her brush is the Swedish black or red oil
pen. She uses it to create caricatures similar to comic strip characters, which are
representative of the expressive nature of her paintings. There is a conversation between
the audience and the artwork, ranging from conspiracies to actual events transmitted
through the medium of comic strips, iconography and of course the esthetics of figurative
drawings in oil on canvas. Deborah’s canvases, usually ornately decorated and highly
textured, with pieces of props come alive like news flash imparted through thought
bubbles which unconsciously suggest ties between each other a technique reminiscence
of conspiracy artist Mark Lombardy. Her style possesses the intensity of an obsessive-
compulsive genius, a thinker in the tradition of Basquiat. If Deborah’s artwork were
indicative of her state of mind, any sane psychiatrist should diagnose her with a neurosis
that went undiagnosed because it cannot be diagnosed because what the artist portrays is
so “American”—we see us in our daily routines. However, I would add that Deborah’s
canvases are a palimpsest of thought processes that have found resolution and demands

attention.
