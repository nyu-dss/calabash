the journal that you are working on; any of these things are source. There are so many
variations on the truth that is out there. We have to define what is the truth and what is
not the truth. I mean you may be reading something in the Washington Post and it says
one thing then in a tabloid newspaper it says another thing. I mean where is the truth? So
it becomes like that. So for me that’s the reason for doing this all over stuff and doing the
all over icons and doing my own invented images and combining it and turning it into

everyone ‘s been turning it into an

Deborah Grant! (Says commentator), our guide to the 21rst Century....

Does your cultural perspective or background affects the way you make art?

Brought up a Catholic? ...The father, the son and the Holy Spirit—you know the Trinity
the threes...

But these are three guys! How can you reproduce with three guys?

My concept on the whole idea of the Trinity is that it’s from the center to the right to the
left back to the middle again...

But as a young woman didn’t you ever feel excluded from the Trinity? Like why is there

not a female presence in the Trinity?

Of course, well yeah absolutely, and why all these images that I saw of all those white
Jesuses.... [mean yeah, I felt very excluded. But at the same time, my teachers were nuns
and priests who were from Indian descent, who were from Korean descent ...you know
they were all from different ... and what was great about it was that they believed in
Hinduism and they believed in Catholicism so we had that conversation ... we had
Catechism classes... So it was always this conversation ... It’s a translation into your
confirmation into the Church, which allows you to take the host (you have to have a first
communion to take the host) ... and anyway I look beyond the figurehead or the figure

image so for me looking at a white Jesus it was just a figurehead...
