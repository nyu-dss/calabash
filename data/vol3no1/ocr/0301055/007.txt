dissecting what I’m seeing within the world within my own eye—what I see—but what’s

interesting I’ve seen is that some people seem to come with the same eye.

I feel like we’re all laden with things. Again it goes back to me seeing the graffiti laden
walls as a kid. You have to understand leaving Canada, which was very clean very
barren. Graffiti wasn’t any where in Canada. Even as a kid at six years old I knew this,
but coming to New York which was this buzz at you at you at you-- this constant thing
like you’re coming up through 42nd street. My dad would take us on drives and we’d go
into different areas and neighborhoods. So it’s like that so I don’t know if ’ve answered

your question.

DM: You’ ve answered my question and one of the things you kept talking about without

using the word is “palimpsest.” You know the word?

(laughs) That’s the name of my new book actually.

I mean that’s a tricky thing. I mean its just coming out of you like you have been created

to do this. You yourself are like a palimpsest.

(laughs) I don’t want to take on that kind of thing; I am just doing pictures here.

...but for me the interpreter.

I am not curing cancer or doing any sort of brain surgery here or changing anyone’s life
for the better. I’m just sort of looking at thing and illustrating them I am choosing to
illustrate, Pollack choose not to illustrate, I’m choosing to illustrate in the 21" Century.
Choosing to illustrate my version of the 21-century. I don’t see myself as defining

history per say... I just try to do what I like.

Thank you very much for that answer. Bell Hooks in Ain’t I a Woman described or

explored the question of the black woman as a victim of white America’s racist
