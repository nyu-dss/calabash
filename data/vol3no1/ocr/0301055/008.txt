attitudes—the black woman is seen as a Diva in some arenas and in others as a single
mother. With this said, how do you view the position or role of the black female artist in

America (which is a privileged position in the world)?

I guess in the first world now, I guess in the 21 Century we have many black women
artists out there now have position themselves and have placed themselves on the map in
regards to the art world and usually the art world is telling of the world. I think that if
anything, I can’t really define that for all black women. I was so glad to be part of
Thelma Golding’s “Post Black” which was freestyle and I think that what Thelma was
trying to do and definitely what Glenda Gone and Thelma were talking about was the
idea that it’s the changing of the guards, it’s the changing and there’s always going to be
removal when there is changing, so for most black women artist I think they just want to
be considered artists in general. Why is there always the association to the schooling that
they had, or their background or something to give them legitimacy to what they are as an
artist. I think many artists come from many different vernaculars. You may have come
from a basic blue-collar background or you may have come from an affluent background
depending on whatever access you have. But I think the act of art making itself is the act

you want to express.

So when you are dealing with people who are viewing your work if you are in a gallery at

the time or in a museum, do they have question for you because you’re a black woman?

Some people can see beyond and some people can’t but I think that’s visible for any
artist. For me to assume what people are saying out there I can’t I don’t know what
people are saying whatever a person deals with they are going to deal with. I can only
speak from my own point of view that the people that the people I’ve dealt with so far
have been connective; connected to what they see and have pushed me out of the way to
allow them to look at the work. To me that is brilliant then; that’s important; that’s
good... they are not interested in the conversation about me whether I’m black, whether
I’m female whatever the conversation is about me, they are interested in the conversation

in the work therefore I have pushed out the parameter of everyone’s conversation on the
