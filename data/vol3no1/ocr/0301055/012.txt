from the map of Iraq it’s the middle section of the map of Iraq where its in green text and
in green iconography for the stars and then / decided to make in silver on the blackboard
as the permanency of the truth. Fredrick Douglas saying we need to look into thing we
need to really study and understand and get clarity and to look into it and not to become
evasive and not just to make an assumption. To make an assumption about any body is
ridiculous and that sort of where I am thinking about combining Fredrick Douglas’s name

next to the mapping section area of Iraq.

T love it.

So it’s like translating that idea. That’s what I’m thinking about... It peers down,
eventually it does peer down, eventually the all-over piece be it the 14 foot piece or be it
the small 48 by 48 panel shaped pieces eventually it all encompasses, eventually it mutes
itself, so I think I am editing at the time the act of adding is editing so the act of me
putting things on top of each text and working and reworking, and working in different
directions with the thing, and drawing different ways and moving the canvas around and
rolling it up and doing sort of an exquisite corps conversation in regards to working on
the canvas; I mean all of that for me allows me to mute things, quite them down, it brings
it to a quite point—especially when I think about (again I go back to Pollack) Blue Poles.
If you look at Blue Poles very carefully it mutes. It allows you to sit and see it in regards
to being maybe falling over trees that’s what I always think of when I think of Blue Poles

and see it in regards to being maybe falling over trees.

That’s what I always think of when I think of Blue Poles, it’s the falling over trees.... in a
forest and what you come upon in that density when you’re in a space, and what it feels
like to be in that space, especially when you’re in nature, it’s like everything is quieted
down, no matter what you’re hearing.... it’s still a different kind of sound, it’s a different
kind of feeling when you’re in nature as when you’re in the city, so, I think about that
idea of the icons and television and all of the different media sources... pixilation which
is television or computers, early artist like Sorat and any of the earlier artists who work in

pointillism, that conversation. I look at media sources: paper, newspapers, magazines,
