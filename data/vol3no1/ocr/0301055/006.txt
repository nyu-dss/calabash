I always think back to and I have always had an affinity to Pollack’s conversation on the
fact that he felt that he did not want to illustrate what was happening in the world, for him
it was the act of allowing nature to happen and how nature was the true benefactor as
well as the true strength of the act of art making. You’re looking within a world you see
from the tiniest plant that shows you the smallest minutia you see the very vein of the
plant which has its own kind of conversation, that’s nature. I think that’s sort of what
Pollack was talking about as much as he didn’t translate as much, he did it in relation to
his work and that’s why people was able to get it—whether it was Clemet Greenburg
having long conversations and going on about Pollack or not whatever his positioning
was whether he was champing him or whatever his positioning was in regards to the art
world, I think Clemet Greenburg saw exactly what everyone saw. This power that was
happening from Pollack’s work, and what Pollack was doing in relation to this drip

action, it translated into something that was very connected to nature.

When we are connected to something that we recognize or something that we are familiar
with, we have a tendency to have an affinity to it rather than to dismiss it or not
understand it. Pollack obviously wasn’t being an artist for art sake; he was influenced by
everything that he was trying to do in regards to the act of emotion. We can go into the
history books in regards to Pollack but for me I choose now to illustrate what’s
happening in the 21 century, because the 21 century has become a huge editorial and its
become dense, we have the Internet, we have everything that’s happen translated into so
many different versions, so its laden, so for me its like how can I combine everything
which is the concepts what I’m seeing in the world be it conspiracy theory, be it history,
be it religion be it politics, be it anything that deals with human nature or nature within
itself. ’m choosing now not to abstract it in away from the world so that it has a read for
me, but a read or all of us only because of the fact that I understand that there is a
leadenness so that’s the idea of having the concept that ’'m thinking about—which is
random select, which is the randomness of putting stuff together so that it has its own sort
conversation. Me unlocking my version of Pandora’s Box and trying to get something
about what I see in the world and putting it all over but its like the small parts where ?m

really working in the drawing area of it and working with the paint pens its like ?’m
