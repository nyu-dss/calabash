So when you close your eyes to pray, you did not see that image? Did you pray?

When I prayed, I prayed in the Hindu sense, like this Hindu priest would teach me the art
of sitting down, relaxing a meditating and this was when I was a kid and this is what Iam
saying that at Our lady of Solace, they were those teachers coming from different
backgrounds but they brought their backgrounds with them into the conversation of
Catholicism and it wasn’t so rigid. They didn’t abandoned their background, they
brought them to the discussion, so when I hear people saying how bad their situation
were in Catholic school, I always felt like I had a better instance with it--this
multicultural experience that was constantly happening into my life. So for me, there was
an openness, and when I work, I usually start from the center, go to the right, back to the
left and back to the center again and so that ‘s how I am doing it...and then let it go...
Ritual is something that we all do...whether unconsciously or consciously...we do a ritual
before we go to bed at night...we do it before we wake up in the morning, we do rituals,

and those are things that we constantly do...

What is the selling points of your. Why is your work for sale besides for the obvious

reasons?

To put food on the table and eventually buy a bigger studio than the one I have now.

Or maybe buy a house!

Actually all I need is a small 2 bedrooms house, okay, but I want a BIG studio!! (Laughs)
I want to build a big studio!—give me a little old truck, that’s what I need. I want to go
upstate New York. The people that have been purchasing my work have been connecting
to the work right away...usually I think that somebody that is going to buy it is a little

more liberal, it’s usually people who are Republicans and very conservative who end up

buying the pieces. It’s an interesting mix...I kind of like that it opens it a little bit and
