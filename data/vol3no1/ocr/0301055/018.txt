about during the sixties and early seventies. So within this conversation you’re going to
have these artists who are going to paint and talk about these particular issues they
learned at Berkeley or Princeton or any of these institutions where black esthetic and
black ideas were discussed. And here you move into the nineteen nineties where
everyone have became more Afro-centric wearing big medallions and big afros and dread
locks and our white counterparts joining in and claiming their own blackness. And so of
course the conversation on blackness is still happening and for students such as myself
the conversation on painting and art making itself had had to be the next realm it had to

come full circle.

The introduction of Picasso to African masks at the Armory Show is an introduction to
something so he’s going to come and bring it full circle. So of course I think of the
relationship to blackness or the act of blackness or post black... post black is for me, that

about their blackness we know we’re black! How the hell we don’t know we are black!
This is what bothers me the most was being confronted constantly about the idea of this
idea about who or what do I think of post black? I couldn’t quite understand where

people were coming from in regards to this.

It became a big dinner table discussion.

I think it became a big dinner table discussion, whether or not it was talked about at Cal
Arts, talked about at Yale or Tower Arts or any number of the institutions out there on
Post Black. What I was trying to say about Post Post black is that its like a cock that has
its tail down in the chicken yard, so, I’m assuming that’s the black existence of Kara
that’s the black existence of Kerry James Marshall that’s the black existence of Jacob
Lawrence and any of the number of artists from the Harlem Renaissance or anything
before. Then there is the younger cock which is the post black sitting and listening while
the older one proclaims that there is not enough cents or the sense that we made little
money or we didn’t get the same notoriety as our white counterparts. There is always

someone to blame in regards to what is the next level. Do you understand what I’m
