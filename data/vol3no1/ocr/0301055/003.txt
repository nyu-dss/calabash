Who is Deborah Grant ?

Born to immigrant parents of Bajan origins, Deborah Grant grew up in Canada before her
family immigrated to the United States back in 1972 where they resided in a New Jersey
hotel while searching for a NY apartment. Deborah described her childhood in Canada
as a mundane experience but one filled with fond memories of her father and brother.
The Grants moved to Coney Island, on West 36" Street, which was close to the Seagate
region of Brooklyn, NY. Deborah was eleven years old and it was there in Brooklyn that
her artistic endeavors began to take shape. Deborah’s parents were particularly interested
in raising their children in an integrated neighborhood similar to the neighborhoods they
experienced in Montréal and Toronto in such areas as Bromley. They were somewhat
apprehensive about living in a hustling and bustling NY, a stark contrast to the “bland,
safe” lifestyle they lead in Canada. As a young African Canadian living in a cultural
masala of various ethnicities such as Vietnamese, Russians, Polish, Africans and Puerto
Ricans neighbors, Deborah and her brother find themselves in a world of abandon
buildings and lots—a true enigmatic wasteland. She observed the scenery from their fire
escape, as she read and traced Mad Comics that belonged to her brother, using store
bought wax paper, an influence seen even to this day in Deborah’s style of painting,
though more intensified and plastered over the entire scope of the canvas they are as
daring as Basquiat. It was among these allies, abandon lots and abandon buildings,
which Deborah described as “sort of like a bombed out bomb shelter, specially during the
seventies which I always associated with the Robert Moses era: house rubble, house
rubble that kind of thing, like where hip hop was born in the Bronx. It’s transforming an
idea or thought processes of going into these abandon lots and what they meant. And in
these abandon lots you find everything: you’d find dead animals; dead cats and I
remember in one instance we found a dead prostitute. I remember when we found her, I
always associate it with “Stand By Me” the movie in a weird way I associate it with that
because I remember as kids making a shine around her. And finally when the police
found her there was this yellow tape everywhere. I remember it was like this thing of
seeing that image and I always knew that those eyes reoccurred in my paintings. I see

them happening over and over. What her eyes looked like, I think of the glossiness of her
