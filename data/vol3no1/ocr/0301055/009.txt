white male artist in a weird way there is a translation with some of my friends: Julie
Marutu, Mickey Thomas, Adia Malett, or Isa Dean, any of the artist I know who work
with a particular issue they see themselves as artists first and the concept of blackness
was always going to be there, is not that blackness is second is that its always going to be
there regardless we’re still in America and America is still a racist society. But it’s the
idea that we recognize that we have validity just as anybody else would, whether we are
black, whether we are female, and whatever sexuality, you understand, it pushes beyond
that. And I think that’s sort of why I was so happy to be apart of the Freestyle group. It’s

because as much as there has been flack about it—it’s been exciting.

There’s always politics.

I understand those who came before us who will lay down... say listen say you have no
concept about what it was like. They had to deal with their own type of politics. And we
are dealing with a new kind of politics with a huge conversation about knowledge and
business. No one talks to the artist about the relationship of what they have to do as a
businessperson. Artist is constantly business, the artist, and the psychiatrist, the
everything for themselves; they have to be every aspect and to wear every hat in order to
project what they want to do in regards to their work. No one talks about what artists has
to go to if someone has a studio visit with them. You know what it feels like to get

prepared for a studio visit?

(Laughs) No, tell me.

A studio visit can be hell for some artists. And I know from my own experience you’ re
removing things you’re putting things away. Almost like you’re protecting yourself, your
protecting your sources—how you use your source material, putting way your mediums
whatever it is you’re doing and then creating the environment that you feel safe enough
to communicate about your work depending whose coming to buy, interview you, take
pictures of your work curate you in regards to a show where they like your work or not.

That’s this thing that is a constant. That’s a huge thing, that’s the business side, if only
