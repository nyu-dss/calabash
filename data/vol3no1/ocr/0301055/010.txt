because that stops your whole entire day. At least for me it does. You’re not able to
work because you’re preparing for it. I had a hard time working today because I wasn’t
sure: “What is he going to say? What is he going to ask me? How I’m going to sound

like; its part of the process and again protecting.

Your work to me represents a sort of tying together a mélange if you will of events

around you and in your own life. It is my interpretation that there is a border or rather a
thin line between what is sanity and what is insanity. Your paintings remind me of how
very close our society is to the brink of being almost like Looney Toons, whirling out of

control. Would you say that this is a correct interpretation?

If you want it to be, if that’s you interpretation then it has to be. You’re an individual
coming to the work. I may have a completely different conversation but each person is
coming to the work differently. And I think that’s sort of why I peer down to the
chalkboards. The chalkboards being very craft oriented, the earliest chalkboard coming
out of the late 1800s, which was the act of teaching—a teaching tool. So if you have
your piece of chalk and you have your cloth and your doing your mathematics and you’re
erasing and then next thing you do is you’re going to move into biology and next thing
you ’re going to talk about English. There are always those remnant of something that’s
have been left over and it’s the removal of the chalkboard and its using it as a tool. The
conversation for me in terms of using the chalkboards is the idea that the peering down
from all of these static the all the all-over-ness the denseness I’m trying to achieve in the
bigger paintings are in the panel pieces the cutout panel birch panel pieces the invented
icon and the non invented icons for the birch panel pieces it being all over I then am able
to take from that and am able to scour down to the chalkboards where by I am beginning
to look at these solid image which is an icon that I am either inventing or borrowing from
a copy free right book or I’m using and using the labeling to sort of make a text to go
along with it that translates it...right now I’m thinking of the Fredrick Douglas piece. [ll
