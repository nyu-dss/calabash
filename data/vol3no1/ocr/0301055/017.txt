have to deal with my maker? I kind of open things up and deal with different sort of

ideas.

You were represented in the widely discussed "Freestyle" show in Spring 2001 at the
Studio Museum of Harlem, a survey of contemporary African-American art. During the
discussion evolving around the exhibition, the term "Post-Black" was coined. In 2003 you
did a blackboard drawing titled "Post-post Black" showing two roosters, one of them
with a speech bubble and a Cent-sign in it. Could you elaborate on both terms, "post-
black" and "post-post black"?

I don’t want to elaborate on Post Black. I can elaborate for Post Post black.

What does Post Black mean any way? Does it mean you stop being black or after being
black?

The dinner conversation was between Thelma Golding and Glenn Laglun conversing
about a title for a show and the ideas was how do we talk about things past Jacob
Lawrence or Romier Bearden or past Kerry James Marshall how do we talk about things
after Carol Walker. How do we converse about all this? I think the basis was what do
we call this show; it’s after everything that has been defined as blackness. I think they

were just coming up with a title for the show.

Are you saying they used the title purely esthetically?

That’s what I understood from it. You would have to ask Thelma or Glenn Laglun. They
know the history in regards to blackness. We know the artist they brought to this table be
in Fred Wilson or... who was the one who protested against Carol Walker getting the
Macarthur grant? Her work or any of the individual who work on blackness that theme
has a lot to do with the seventies. In the seventies we had the biggest influx of black
students going to some of the major institutions around the country. So its almost clear

and it almost evident that their senses of blackness needed to be proclaimed and talked
