when I was in grad school, I had it in the background of my mind like every grad student

whether they vocalize it or not.

I feel like I give birth in the studio and it’s like the people that have purchased my work, I
stay in touch with them and I feel like we become friends in a way. I feel like I get a
connection when people call me and say Deborah I just saw something in your piece and
they give me their history on it...that’s when it’s power... for me that’s right on...And I
always had an assumption on things and I am learning now don’t assume anything...
Don’t assume a thing in life...cause once you’re assuming, you’ve made the biggest
mistake of your entire life. That’s what I am really beginning to soak into my brain every
single day of my life. We all have a sense of conservatism, liberalism whatever ...there
are those aspects in all of us and I agree with certain Republicans...I do, and there are
some liberals I don’t agree with ...to be honest with you I wasn’t always quite connected
with everything that Clinton said or did... I think certain reason of why the war happened
had to do with certain bombing approved by Clinton.

So you don’t really take a side?

I can’t really take a side. As an artist, I don’t want to pick a side. And that’s why I don’t
vote either...for that reason... because I don’t want to take a side in this. As far as ’'m
concerned...there are certain things that happen to my work that are side taking but I kind
of want to say look at it all and everybody is doing it...and I kind a look at it like when
Andy Warhol said: I don’t know Bruno? Do you like this Bruno? I don’t know Bruno...
It seems that in comparison to your early work, you are using the color grey more and
more...It is apparent in your large work as well as in the choice of silver for your
blackboard drawing...Why did you choose this particular color?

Cause gray is the gray areas that we all sit in.

Didn’t want to go any further with that... Thank you very much.
