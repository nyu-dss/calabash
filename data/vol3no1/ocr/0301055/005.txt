Interview:

The interview with Deborah Grant took place in her studio, which is in a Columbia
University building located on 128" Street between Broadway and Riverside Drive.
Deborah’s studio is about 14 x 14 ft in dimension. It is located on the second floor
parallel to 125" street a block away from the Cotton Club and the one and nine elevated

trains.

DM: It would appear that in the 21°" Century art and the role of artists are up in the air
and widely interpreted by the public—Lichtenstein, Duchamp and Warhol to coin a few
artists created new views and insights about the role of art in the 21° Century: Duchamp
and his claims to readymade art and Andy Warhol and his claims to silk screening and its
reproductive quality. Duchamp’s and Warhol’s intent behind this was that each
preferred to show ordinary things in a new light. In away, to showcase things that no
one else gave a second thought. Lichtenstein use of the comic strip is another example of
how art is constantly reinvented or redefined by artists. I believe that your medium and
the product you produce is exemplary of art as a constantly evolving medium that is not
Static as for example when discussing surrealism or Dadaism. How then would you

define yourself as an artist in post-modern America?

DG: That’s huge, that’s a lot to take on that would show that I assume I have some sort of
big ego or something. I don’t know, I don’t know how to define that. I don’t know if I
am conscious of working towards being a part of history per say that’s not where I’m at
with it. The act of being able to do this everyday or having the access to be able to come
to the studio to work is massive. I don’t believe per say to what these men were thinking
in their minds in regards to what they were doing as artist. I don’t think any artist comes
with the idea that they are changing history, I think that sometimes artists come and talk
about history and sort of act like a reporter in regards to history but not necessarily doing
an editorial per say over from the written word but transcribing what they are feeling or

what they feel about their relationship of being in the world.
