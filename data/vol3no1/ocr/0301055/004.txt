eyes. The fact that she had the bluest eyes but there was this weird glossy film that had
gone over the eyes and one was closed and the other wide open. But what I remembered

99

most of all was her false eyelashes.” Deborah also reminisced about Catholic shrines she

made with her brother in those abandon lots; including one for the fallen streetwalker.

“T noticed that certain eyes that I put in the paintings sort of come back to me. Like this
guy here you see him walking with his eyes sort of glossed over but there is that faded
sense the same thing that keep reoccurring are the eyes and I think that has a lot to do
with finding that dead prostitute at such a young age.” Everyone dumped in the abandon
lots. And out of the garbage she created shrines. Deborah’s favorite book is called JT
because of its association with photographer, Gordon Park Junior. The story of JT is he
finding a cat and he being harassed by other children in the neighborhood. Deborah
described her childhood in Brooklyn as living a dual life. One life consist of her
ritualistic and disciplined Catholic school trained, Caribbean upbringing, which was,

influenced by archaic British customs and on the other hand her survival in the hood.

Deborah’s artwork transcends race, gender, politics and even religion it exemplifies the
relocation of her family in over fifteen different locations in the US alone. Importantly,
Deborah’s work does not point fingers nor is it didactic or polemical. The work is
certainly an embodiment of our time. And as is befitting to coin this artist’s hard work: a
chronicle of our collective struggles to maintain balance in a highly hierarchical society,
plagued by multiple systems and schisms detrimental to our “health”. Deborah is able to
tie together the psychological effects of slavery and mercantilism exacted on the
American populace and illustrates the connection between that and the social effects of
corporate greed, which then influences the political and to a degree affects the historical.
She demonstrates how these ideas are part and parcel of the choices we make and even
the drugs we take in the 21" century. The depth of her work is ontological, holistic and

exclamatory.
