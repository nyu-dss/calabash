Coast Guard boat and divers were there. People were talking over loud speakers
and police were telling everyone to keep away from the edge.

The sea at the hour looked to be as black as ink. And a strange mood came over
the crowd. All of us stood there silent and looking, but all of us were scared. The cloud
of death was in the air. A man was drowned under that water and they hadn’t found his
body. We had no idea what else could be down there. All kinds of phantom monstrous
creatures, I suppose. Even the Coast Guard people looked like they were ready to give it
up. One death was bad enough, nobody wanted two.

Then Mr. Rhumbay came on the scene, pushing his way through. “Wha going
on?” he asked.

“A man drown down hey,” he was told.

“Who? Who? Wha man drown?”

“A man name George, Georgie Lanclos.”

“But that a mi friend,” Rhumbay said. “That a me fucking friend.” And with
that, fully clothed as he was, he dived into that mysterious and frightening looking water.
He was under there so long people thought that he, too, had drowned. The he surfaced,
took a deep breath and went back down again. This time when he came up, he had
Georgie’ body with him.

The Coast Guard launch took them both aboard. Georgie was dead, there was no
question about it. But nobody could believe Rhumbay had done such a thing. Dived into
hell without fear or hesitation and came out victorious with a dead friend in his arms.

Since that time, I have seen lots of courageous thins done in movies, but I have
never seen anything to match what Rhumbay did that night. And after that night, people
stopped calling him “Caveman” or even “Rhumbay.” After that he became “Mister

Rhumbay,” man of distinction.
