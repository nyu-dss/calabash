Rhumbay never went to school. I have no idea if he could read or write.
Rhumbay was a caveman. And everybody knows cavemen didn’t need any education.

So that was that.

What Rhumbay did for a living was also a mystery. Sometimes he farmed a piece
of property he had up in the hills. Other times he would work for the West India
Company packing freight. P ve seen him in town posing for tourists who would take his
picture and then give him money . .. . One other thing he would do from time to time is
swim way outside the harbor to the big ocean liner tourist ships, with a bag tied around
his waist. Him and three other Buckhole fellows would do this. When they got there,
they would call out and tease the crew on the ship. “Hey! Hey! You up there. Ugly ape
man. Your mother musta been a ape before you,” and things like that. The crew would
take potatoes and throw at them, trying to hit them in the head. It was kind of a game
with real live targets. Rhumbay and his friends would dive, get the potatoes and put them
in the bag. When the bags were full they would swim, cook some of the potatoes, sell the
rest and make some money out of the deal. Now you have to realize the length they had
to swim to get to the ship. It was perhaps six or seven miles. And the depth of the water
when they got there. This was enough water to displace a monster ocean liner and keep it
afloat. The bottom must be miles and miles below. But Rhumbay and his friends didn’t
care. So long as they could get the crew to throw potatoes, everything was fine.

Rhumbay loved movies, and Saturday night was his night. He used to sit in the
pit with his friends and talk in a loud voice all through the pictures and nobody would tell
him a word.

One night after the movies there was some excitement going on at the pier close
by. The hour was close to midnight but there was lots of flashlights and spotlights and
police cars and stuff. Something was definitely going on. So all of us went to see what
the commotion was about.

There was a good crowd of people. And the word was somebody fell off the pier
and drowned. At the time there was a whole lot of dredging going on because they were
getting ready to make a waterfront out of the whole area. People were warned not ot go
on the docks because the boards were rotten. And with the dredging, the bottom was dep

and sticky.
