MISTER RHUMBAY

Now, I need to tell you about mister Rhumbay ... Rhumbay was a local fellow
who lived in a place called Buckhole. Buckhole was a swamp area where only the
poorest people lived. It wasn’t only a ghetto. It was a disgrace and a tragedy. It doesn’t
exist any more. The year just before I left the island government sent in bulldozers, razed
the whole area, filled in the swamp and built low court housing for everybody. But in
those days, Buckhole was a world unto itself. As kids in high school, we would often
walk through Buckhole because they said Buckhole girls were easier and wore less
clothes. It wasn’t necessarily true, but we believed the fantasy right into adulthood.

Rhumbay came out of Buckhole and Rhumbay had more muscles than any human
has a right ot have. Rhumbay had so many muscles that we used to say that Rhumbay
had strongman muscles even in his eyeballs. He wasn’t tall but he was strapping. And
his skin was black. Not brown or dark, but black. Jet black. Word had it that Rhumbay
hadn’t worn a shirt in maybe fifteen years. That’s the reason they say his skin was so
black. Because of the sun beating down on it so much. And Rhumbay didn’t do
anything special to get those muscles. He was just born that way, that’s all. Short,
strapping and strong. Rhumbay was so strong that everybody use dot leave him alone.
Even when he would get drunk and start acting disorderly, police wouldn’t try to arrest
him. They were afraid he would break something on one of them. Or maybe pick them
up and throw them into a tree or something. So they would just let him do what he had to

do until he got tired and fell to sleep.
