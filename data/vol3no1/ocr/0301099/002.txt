THE BLUE HOLE
(Lighthouse Reef, Belize)

It’s coral lip diced with mid-night parrot-fish,
a mostly naked Belizean boy guides me
down, 60 feet, my breath

deepens, raspy, searches for rhythm.

Blue, beyond the eyes’ capacity for blue.
His brown arm hugs me, 90 feet, slow

tumble of SCUBA gear, a quick fluid chill.
I scale, I green, a soul-bird, a harpie, calls

shifting notes, Come with me, I turn

to the Blue Rapture, twilight suspended, I sink
into a toothy cave, my kick

weakens, with me, hair coils

one fin gently lashes, lungs blue dented,

the black blue bruise, a swallowing sapphire,
a chorus of aquatic sirens, breath bubbles,
shimmers, a stream of spinning universes

the boy waves, Come, waves, with us, waves.
