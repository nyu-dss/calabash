BLIND SWIMMERS

As you explore, dream a little.
Dazzle yourself.

Compose your own individual medley of strokes:

free back breast _ butterfly.

Your breath streaks in nests of bubbles.

Mind the splash lanes,
secure your opaque goggles.
I imagine a stripe of bananas along the lip,
where they shimmer best.

You may compete with the sighted;
vision balms their eyes, gets messy, aquatic.
Donâ€™t forget, they are porous when
body waters urge forward.

Go ahead, you say, close your eyes.
Scoop yourself out, your liquid self
breath to breath.

For a moment, all ions repel
and you are a mystic
at birth with yourself.
