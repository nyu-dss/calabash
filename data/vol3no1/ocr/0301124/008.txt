dozen [she has] on hand, [and] the end portion of a bread which she always discarded”
(Marshall 249) to children that appeared to her as undernourished. Furthermore, she gets
very annoyed with the children innocently wandering on her private strip of the beach.

Her interactions with men in the novel further underscores her colonial racism.
On Harriet’s first night on the island Lyle Hutson (a successful Black lawyer and senator
on the island) touches her in a strongly sexual manner. At this touch, Harriet has the
feeling that it is not Lyle’s hands, which made contact with her “but rather some dark and
unknown part of herself which had suddenly, for the first time ever, surfaced, appearing
like stigmata or an ugly black-and-blue mark at the place he had touched” (Marshall 97).
Here, Harriet’s feelings illustrate a mixture of arousal and repulsion, a paradox that she
cannot resolve. The word in the novel is stigmata, which when converted to its noun
form, is stigma, and refers to “the shame and disgrace attached to something”
(Soukhanov 1416). Although, Harriet’s entertaining of Bournehills women and taking
care of the children’s cuts and bruises necessitates her touching their black skins, it is
only Lyle’s touch that repulses and haunts her throughout the novel. She directs much of
her conscious antipathy towards him because she feels somehow contaminated by his
suggestion of social and sexual miscegenation in a situation where she considers herself
superior to him.

Lyle repulses Harriet because “the coexistence of [his] success, power, and
darkness unnerves Harriet especially because they are so alike in their smugness and
snobbery and in their manipulation of others” (Olmstead 8). The poor women and
children do not repulse Harriet because she clearly sees that they are not on the same
economic or educational level with her. The women and children of Bournehills are not a
threat to the established social order that posits Harriet and her “blue-blooded” (Marshall
452) white counterparts at the top of that order.

Much the same way Harriet dislikes Lyle, she develops a dislike for Vereson
Walkes a young man of Bournehills who underwent a positive transformation in his
demeanor and outlook on life. When Harriet notices that Vereson obtained a job, a
girlfriend and had a car that was clearly the envy of others in the village, the novel’s

narrator described her reaction thus:
