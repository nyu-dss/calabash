[Harriet] recalled the times she had glimpsed [Vereson] working alongside
Leesy in the latter’s small cane piece adjoining the house or
accompanying her somewhere on the donkey cart. Seeing them crawling
along the road at a snail’s pace behind the plodding animal, with
[Vereson] seated beside the straight-backed Leesy like some sleepy-eyed
young primitive...and would have preferred tohave them remain
just that way. (Marshall 349).

Harriet’s need to control is evident in her relationship with her husband Saul. She
loses control however, when Merle and her contradictions contaminate her sense of social
order and racial purity by sleeping with Saul. Ironically, the affair takes place on the
night of the Carnival parade when Merle and the Bournehills gang re-enact the Cuffee
Ned story and Harriet gets caught up in the crazy swirl of Black bodies that bear her
along in its frenzy. During the melee, Harriet fears for her personal safety and tries to
regain composure by giving orders to one of the revelers. In reaction to the reveler
ignoring her, Harriet is enraged and feels as if she “could have struck her .... Not angrily,
but the way one strikes an impertinent child to remind it of its status” (Marshall 295).

It is this need to remind (Black) others of their status that leads to Harriet’s
demise in a Caribbean space that is inherently filled with contradictions and resistant to
colonial ordering. Harriet’s inherent need to harness the situations around her lends itself
to reinscription of a colonial mentality to coerce behavior. This leads her to offer Merle
money to leave the Island and Saul behind. When that ploy fails, Harriet convinces the
foundation responsible for funding Saul’s research to remove him from the project and
place the project on hold. As a result, Saul leaves Harriet and in the wake of her second
failed marriage Harriet is forced to recognize all the other failures in her personal history:
her ancestor who dealt in “flour and human flesh” (Marshall 457); her mother the
“hopeless, un-constructed southern Belle” (Marshall 458); and the hands of her first
husband and hers “on the lever and together the two of them, perversely, as if driven by
an excess of power, committing the monstrous act that could only bring about their own
end” (Marshall 458).

Remembering her past helps Harriet to realize an “essential truth” (Marshall 459)
about herself, which stated simply is how deeply she in her pervasive need for control

was involved in the colonialist agenda. Ultimately, when Saul leaves her, he strips away
