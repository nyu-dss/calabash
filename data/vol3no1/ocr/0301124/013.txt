of this process. This discussion is particularly important in literary works because the
ideas put forth in literature are often “transposed into politics” (Mack 2143).

The characters of The Chosen Place are heirs to and descendants from a shared
history bound up with colonialism. Through the characters’ relations with each other, it is
evident that each one emerges from a specific worldview that views a shared colonial
history differently. As characters differ in their view of history, they differ in the value

they place on the past and its possibility to transform the future.
