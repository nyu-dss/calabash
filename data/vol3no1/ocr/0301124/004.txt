The third group of people is the white visitors to the Island. This group includes
expatriates, who are representing British economic interest on the island, and two main
characters, Saul and Harriet Amron, who are Americans on the Island to establish an
economic development project in Bournehills. An important feature of this group is that
it is comprised of individuals whose families amassed wealth from the business of
enslaved Africans that occurred on Bourne Island. In a patronizing attempt to uplift the
residents of Bournehills, the white visitors work in tandem with New Bristol neo-
colonials and ignore the specific history and cultural claims of the villagers.

The collusion between the former colonials and the neo-colonials, actively
resisted by the proud villagers, is a fulcrum around which the characters relate to one
another and compete to re-present the history of an island that is ostensibly independent
of its colonial overlords. The figure of the rebel slave leader, Cuffee Ned, is crucial to
this historical re-presentation and each group comes with an ancestral background that
determines its response to Cuffee Ned. The story of Cuffee Ned acts as a prism that
reflects the individual charactersâ€™ political positioning with respect to the historical
trajectory and the socio-political reality that should govern the island and its peoples. His
rebellion haunts the social paradigm represented by the three groups and makes him a
link between the past and the present, and the consummate embodiment of the
revolutionary struggle against colonialism and slavery. It is this political positioning vis-
a-vis Cuffee Ned that shapes character development in the novel and establishes the
different ways that descendants with various legacies relate to each other to support or

subvert the neocolonial paradigm.

Women in the Novel

The women in the novel present the opposite extremes of the social and
ideological spectrum as it pertains to colonialism. They are characters that represent
competing viewpoints on their colonial inheritances and ancestry. Merle is a Black
Caribbean woman and Harriet is a white American married to Saul Amron, one of the
economic developers sent to the Island by an American charitable foundation. The two
women are at odds with each other in much the same way that colonialism and the

revolutionary fight for freedom are inherently at odds with each other. Specifically,
