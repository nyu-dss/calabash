Harriet as a descendant of colonialists adheres to the ideals of colonialism and seeks to
re-inscribe colonial politics in every space that she encounters. Merle on the other hand,
is an adamant protester of colonialism and centralizes her energy to inject in Bourne
Islanders the revolutionary fervor needed to liberate them from the holds of the post-

colonialist machinery.

Merle Kinbona

Merle, the novel’s protagonist, is a descendant of both the African slaves and their
colonial masters; however, she is more at one with her African heritage and demonstrates
this in her compassionate love and interest for the African descendants and heirs of
poverty around her. Her compassion serves as her means of countering the lingering
effects of the “great wrongs” perpetuated by colonialism. So intense is her compassion
that she often falls into a depressed state (this sometimes because of her personal
problems) whenever chaos ensues in or for the Bournehills district. Nevertheless, Merle
disallows this from hindering her resistance and reaches out to the people of Bournehills
in various ways. She reads to the poor children of the Almshouse, showing them that they
in their poverty have not been forgotten. She is an outspoken critic who condemns the
Governments’ devouring of public resources for private gain. Moreover, and more
symbolically, Merle as a part time teacher introduces the Cuffee Ned legacy into her
classroom to teach an alternate history of the Island to her students.

Apart from her compassionate rebellion, Merle’s other prominent attribute is that
she is a noisy person. She speaks almost unceasingly and loudly as a way to mask her
personal problems and to constantly communicate her resistance. To this effect, in
regards to her communicating resistance, Merle seems to move always within the
ambiance of the noise made by an armful of bracelets that she wears always. These
bracelets are similar to the bracelets worn by the women of Bournehills when they
perform an annual re-enactment of the Cuffee Ned rebellion. In the re-enactment, the
women use the bracelets to create a loud clanging noise, a symbolic show of resistance
against oppression and oneness with the human qualities that Cuffee Ned represents.

Thus, by wearing her bracelets Merle makes a symbolic show of resistance at all times.
