“THE GREAT WRONG”:
THE COLLUSION OF FORMER COLONIALS AND
THE NEO-COLONIALS IN PAULE MARSHALL’S
A CHOSEN PLACE, A TIMELESS PEOPLE

“Once a great wrong has been done, it never dies. People speak the words of peace, but
their hearts do not forgive. Generations perform ceremonies of reconciliation but there is
no end.”

Epigraph, The Chosen Place, The Timeless People

In her novel The Chosen Place, the Timeless People, Paule Marshall deals with
the “great wrong” of imperial atrocities perpetrated against formerly colonized nations.
Published in 1969, The Chosen Place is set on Bourne Island, a fictitious Caribbean
island that was once a British colony. On Bourne Island there are three groups of people
in particular around whom the story revolves: the rural villagers of Bournehills, the
urbane, neocolonial power brokers of New Bristol and the Euro-American economic
development specialists who represent the economic interests of the former colonists. In
presenting members of these three groups, the novel examines the residual effects of
colonialism within the Caribbean and the struggle to define a self-empowered Caribbean
future.

The first section of the novel is entitled “Heirs and Descendants” and throughout
the novel, Marshall presents the descendants of the colonial system who have inherited

“many of the basic problems and conflicts which beset oppressed peoples everywhere"
