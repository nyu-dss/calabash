control of her life Harriet ultimately commits suicide.

Men in the Novel

While the women are at opposite ends of the spectrum as foils for each other, the
two main men, Lyle and Saul, serve a similar inverse function. Saul is the white man who
can empathize with the struggle and contradictions represented by Merle. Lyle is the
Black man who bears an uncanny resemblance to the colonial oppressor represented by

Harriet.

Saul Amron

As Harriet’s husband, Saul is an heir of wealth accumulated by slave labor on
Bourne Island. However, he is also heir to a Jewish tradition. Like his ancestor the
apostle Paul, who was struck on the road to Damascus by a vision from God[5], Saul
“was struck...there on the road to Spiretown, by a double memory that had about it the
quality of a vision” (Marshall 163), which brought back memories of his family and then
of the atrocities that his ancestors faced, which was “the means by which he understood
the suffering of others” (Marshall 164).

With this frame of reference, Saul seeks and achieves a clear understanding of the
socio-economic problems of the village by becoming close friends with the people of
Bournehills, and taking an active and genuinely caring role in Bournehills’ life. In fact,
Saul became so involved in the life there that Merle commented that he was becoming “a
rumhead just like those others down at the shop” (Marshall 262) with whom he socialized
with on a nightly basis. Saul percieves Bournehills a “troubled region within himself to
which he had unwittingly returned” (Marshall 100) and this leads him to deal with his
troubled past. Saul deals with the death of his first wife and child and starts the healing
process that puts him on the road to choose between Harriet (the imperialist-colonialist
that was responsible for the “great wrong” done to the African slaves) and Merle (the

symbol of resistance against the imperialist-colonialist). When Saul leaves Harriet, he
