(Shaping 111). The heirs and descendants of Bourne Island suffer from the effects of the
“great wrong” that shapes character and influences the social and political relationships
that obtain on the island. In order to understand the colonial tensions that drive the novel
one has to understand the social groupings and the individual characters that the social
groupings produce. As the characters emerge, they have to deal with the legacy of
slavery and colonialism that contribute to their position in the social hierarchy of the
Island.

The first group of people is the Bournehills villagers who are rural-dwellers.
They are, for the most part, poor working class people who have a strong economic
reliance on their former colonial source of income -- farming sugarcane. Life in
Bournehills has an unsettling sense about it, which derives from the place’s long history
of oppression that provokes those living there to confront their past or suffer destruction.
The Bournehills residents are mostly descendants of African slaves, who hold on strongly
to their legacy of resistance against enslavement. In particular, they are most proud of
the fact that Bournehills was once home to Cuffee Ned, a powerful figure who led the
most successful slave revolt in the Caribbean islands. After careful planning, Cuffee Ned
managed to usurp his colonial master’s power over much of the island for up to three
years. Although the British captured and then beheaded him, Cuffee Ned became a
symbolic figure to the residents of Bournehills. As a symbolic figure, he instilled in the
Bournehills residents the qualities of hope, unity, “peace, freedom, and the refusal to
allow [themselves] to be violated” (Harris 66).

The second group of people is the New Bristol residents who are mostly
politicians and other higher-level professionals that control the island’s politics and
economy. These professionals are descendants of African slaves and the former colonial
rulers or sometimes descendants of both. Like the former colonial masters who built
their economy on slave labor, these professionals strive to amass wealth at the expense of
the lower classes of Bourne Island, while catering in particular to the needs of foreign
business interest. As the urbane, neo-colonial elite of the island they eschew the past and
envision a future for the island based on “poor planning, [a] condescending attitude
...[and a] failure to include the villagers directly in the process” that can lead to

meaningful social and economic reform for the island. (Marshall 157)
