harmonization of the contradictory forces within her when she is finally “unburdened
restored to herself” (Marshall 463). The talcum powder that “seemed to mute her
darkness” is gone, and like the sea that bemoaned the slaves who died in it found

restoration and ceased its moaning, so Merle becomes a quieter woman.

Harriet Amron

While Merle finds her peace by reconciling the contradictory parts of herself,
Harriet suppresses contradiction altogether. As an American woman who grew up in the
South with a Black nanny, Harriet is steeped in absolute racial values that she cannot
articulate. As a child Harriet thought that her nanny, Alberta, was turned black as a
punishment for some wrong that Alberta had committed. With such an upbringing,
Harriet finds the contradictory principles that Merle represents are equivalent to an
unwanted contamination of the social ideologies to which she adheres. Harriet is an heir
to wealth accumulated in the business of enslaved Africans that specifically took place on
Bourne Island. She has trouble remembering, deliberately suppresses her history, and
constantly worries through out the novel that others will know of her past.

It is axiomatic that those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.
Harriet suppresses her colonial past because any acknowledgement of past would include
resistance to colonialism in the form of legends like Cuffee Ned. The power of Cuffee
Ned is not just that he fought against slavery, but that he bequeathed the memory of
rebellion that challenges any projections of whiteness and colonial politics as all-
powerful. Since Harriet Amron is not going to participate in a reflection on the past that
questions whiteness, she lives only in the present where she can assert a social order in
which she is at the top.

Harriet’s social ordering is really a racial ordering as well and her racism
manifests itself in the interactions she has with the women and children of the
Bournehills village. She takes great effort to socialize with the women of Bournehills,
care for their children’s bruises and cuts, and does other charitable work for the children
of the island. But as the novel progresses, she undermines her own charity with an
attitude that regards the residents as inferior and she interacts with then “in a vague,

detached manner” only (Marshall 392). She gives “five eggs out of the more than two
