chooses Bournehills and validates the vision of triumph and rise of the world’s darker
peoples over the imperialist-colonialist.

Saul’s choice in a way demonstrates his own connection with Cuffee Ned and the
spirit of rebellion that infects Bournehills. In fact, Saul confesses to Merle that seeing the
Cuffee Ned revolt re-enacted made him “to think of [his ancestors]” (Marshall 314).
Cuffee Ned represents historical victory for a people, Black and Jewish, over oppressive

forces, as well as personal victory, from a personal painful past for Saul.

Lyle Hutson

Lyle Hutson is completely colonized. Lyle, though a descendant of African
slaves is the opposite of Merle Kinbona. In fact, he is referred to as “Harriet’s Black-
racist counterpart” (Olmsted 18). Lyle therefore has adopted the consciousness and

the cane field... Things are no different. The chains [of slavery] are still on” (Marshall
210). Ultimately, Lyle’s true colonial colors emerge at the point in the novel where he

abdicates his political responsibility to the people by going on vacation when the
