Merle is a descendant of one of the more prominent white, planter families on the
Island, and is also an heir to her own contradictory and complicated personal history; a
common phenomenon for life in the Caribbean. She is a dark-skinned woman with strong
African-features, and very light brown eyes that are a throwback to her European roots.
She wears talcum powder almost as a paint to mute her color. Her mother was murdered
in her presence but she is unable to identify the killer for the authorities, a fact that haunts
the woman who believes in the power of remembering. Her father’s money gives her
access but not acceptance at a posh boarding school where she grapples with the abuses
she receives from half-white pupils. In a search of a mother figure she has a lesbian affair
as the kept woman of a wealthy, white patroness while she is a student in London. This
relationship leads to a repeat of maternal loss when later her husband, unaware of her
previous lifestyle, leaves her and takes their daughter to Africa.

Having to deal with her problems, however, Merle becomes a reflection of the

(Marshall 5). Interestingly enough, the “hills” in question are those utilized to plant
Bournehills’ main source of income—sugarcane, the king of crops during slavery.

The persistence of the suffering of slavery means that Bournehills residents are
the inheritors of continued domination by the colonial system even in the historical
moment after colonialism. In using Merle as the transitory medium to equate colonial
legacies with contemporary problems, the novel suggests that Merle is also the
contemporary form of resistance for the Island as was Cuffee Ned in his time. The
personal issues that Merle grapples with takes a toll on her ability to function as an
integral unit of her social surroundings. By the end of the novel she regains her
confidence, hope, and resolve and sets out for Africa to reestablish contact with her lost
family. Additionally, she resolves to enter politics on her return to Bourne Island as a
means to continue her revolutionary campaign to dissolve the “great wrongs” of
colonialism and afford Bourne Island a greater degree of independence from its former

colonial master. The novel’s narrator articulates Merle’s transformation as a
