sugarcane industry is nearly toppled to the economic detriment of the villagers of
Bournehills.

Lyle sees and refers to Merle’s and the Bournehills resident’s belief that another
Cuffee Ned would come to deliver them from their socio-economic problems as a hope
for an “impossible revolution” (Marshall 208). Lyle Hutson, therefore, does not place
Cuffee Ned in the same context as Merle and others of Bournehills. Since, he has
internalized and accepted white racism. Cuffee Ned, therefore, represents a part of him
(his color and history) that he seeks to erase through marriage, much like his female
counterpart, Harriet. More damning however, is that Cuffee Ned represents ideals, and

values onto which he ascribes no special significance.

Colonial Challenges

What Cuffee Ned represents to the individual characters does not remain on the
individual level; it is transferable from the specific of the individual, to the larger group
of people the individual characters in question represent. It follows then that the historical
legacy of Cuffee Ned represents the future to Saul and Merle who want to alleviate the
colonial legacy of Bourne Island and the formerly colonized world. To understand this
concept one must first know the political statement that Marshall sought to make with the
novel. Marshall wrote of The Chosen Place:

In it there is a conscious attempt to project the view of the future to which
Iam personally committed. Stated simply it is a view, a vision if you will,
which sees the rise through revolutionary struggle of the darker peoples of

the world and, as a necessary corollary, the decline and eclipse of America
and the West (Marshall 108).

Despite Marshall’s “conscious attempt” to thoroughly undermine the colonial
legacy of the Caribbean through the figure of Cuffe Ned, the novel is still an incomplete
examination of the “rise...of the darker peoples...” Two aspects of the debate that remain
unexamined deal with which system should replace the Western system of colonial
oppression; and how can that replacement system avoid reinscribing colonial politics.
These are important considerations because historically the oppressed becomes the next

generations of oppressors and Lyle Hutson and Harriet Amron represent the continuation
