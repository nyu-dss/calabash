Her lipstick is fresh.
She waits on a white paint dock.
His boat cuts down waves.

The puma is shy —
sleeping on her long cold branch.
She won’t be fooled twice.

Punta breaks our hips,
sweat shines from an open palm,
I am his rhythm.

Birds whittle in dawn.
I can’t remember how much
I forgot to love.

Boat winds lash my hair.

My face stings from the sharp spray.

Go faster, I say.

His black coral eyes,
his fire coral fingers;
between us, oceans.

No words for the sky.
The ocean bleeds its dark ink.
My fingers stained blue.

Palm leaf shadows shake
like his shoulders when we danced.
He’s not coming back.
