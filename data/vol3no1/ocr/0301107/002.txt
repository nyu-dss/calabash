ISLAND HAIKUS

The cocoanut groves
haunt the hot island breezes:
a song of dropped fruit.

Night clouds shroud the moon.
A black-green sea flutters wild.
Dark rum sand shivers.

Yellow and orange
butterflies rest in the palms.
His hands blaze my skin.

Sting-rays chase a girl.
Her mouth, full of mango, screams.
She clings to the dock.

Vermillion pink blooms

and orchids sprout through mangroves.

Your voice is so clear.

Sailboats slip by slow.
The moon lights their wings. The reef
steers the captainâ€™s aim.
