how a former slave became the powerful First Consul of the prosperous “pearl of the
Antilles.”

In this novel Bell personalizes the two historically decisive battles at Ravine a
Couleuvre and La Créte a Pierrot that eventually led to the surrender of the Haitian
armies. Bell skillfully details the violence of the bloody battles waged in the plains and
the mountain regions throughout the country. The French generals, Leclerc and
Rochambeau, are depicted in their full arrogance of beliefs that they can easily put down
a “nigger insurrection” and return the prized colony to French rule. Equally compelling
are the portrayals of the brave Haitian generals in Toussaint’s army, cowardly
Christophe, the wily Sans Souci and the relentless Dessalines, as they wage a determined
struggle against the French using soldiers and laborers .

In this novel Dessalines emerges as the Toussaint’s rival and successor general for
control of the military and eventually Haiti itself. Although Dessalines is not fleshed out
as a character, any good history of the Haitian revolution reveals that he was totally
resistant to any capitulation to the French and as such preferred an all out fight for
freedom or death. Toussaint, on the other hand, wanted to negotiate with the French to
rid Haiti of Leclerc and stem the devastating losses suffered by both sides. With an
intelligent regard for the duplicitous behavior of the French, Bell spends only a few pages
to deal with their ignoble rejection of peace by arresting Toussaint and his family. The
rest of the novel really is history as Bell recreates scenes of Toussaint’s final humiliating
days in exile in his French prison.

The portentous nature of French refusal that leads to a truly independent Haiti is
mirrored in the title of the book. The title of the novel, The Stone that the Builder

Refused, is attributed to a line from Bob Marley, a quote that is Biblical in its origins and

 

refers to Christ as the rejected stone that becomes the bedrock of a revolutionary new
faith. Indeed, this seems to be the trajectory of the story where Toussaint takes on mythic
proportions as a revolutionary savior of the Haitian people and the avatar of freedom for
enslaved people everywhere. His arrest and deportation, far from ending the revolt in
Haiti, fostered stronger ties between warring Black and mulatto factions and crystallized

their mutual goals for an independent nation.
