This scene is one of the strongest moments in the book where finally readers get a
sense of shy Toussaint, who always covers his mouth when he laughs, as a man capable
of great love and gentleness. A few pages later, Toussaint presents his sons with the
agonizing choice of joining him in the war against the reinstatement of slavery or
supporting France. Ironically, Placide (whose name in English means tranquil) chooses
to fight by his father’s side while morose and scholarly Isaac (whose name means
laughter) chooses not to bear arms against a land of which he has grown very fond.* In
ensuing scenes the enigmatic Toussaint share with Placide his military secrets and his
hopes for the outcome of the war, secrets and hopes otherwise a mystery to even his
trusted advisers.”

Besides Toussaint’s sons, there is a plethora of children who run the gambit of
racial admixtures that were recognized by the slave system, who freely live, play and

what was one of the greatest aspects of Toussaint’s rule: a determined attempt to
eradicate the prevalent race prejudice of colonial slavery. The presence of the children
who do not recognize race among themselves is a powerful statement against the illogic

Toussaint understood that a successful Haiti could only be a society of equals and
sought to create a Haiti where racial prejudice was checked by intimate contacts among
Black people, whites and mulattoes. The word “intimate” is not without a double

relations among members of the three groups. In fact, if Bell’s fictionalizing points to
some truth, Toussaint himself performed a sexualized kind of politics thorough multiple
liaisons with white women, moved by “curiosity rather than passion,” and aware that in
the end such encounters were merely “political.” °

Papa Toussaint’s dalliances aside, his politics of inclusion shows his astuteness in
recognizing that racial harmony was the only way to redeem the revolutionary enterprise.

Indeed the French insistence racial stratification through force proves to be the ultimate
