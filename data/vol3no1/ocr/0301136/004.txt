To polish off the trilogy Bell brings back the usual cast of characters with a few
new members thrown in to heighten the dramatic tension of the novel. Readers meet
some soldiers and random white persons who moved in creole French circles. There are
still the holdout members of the white planters and aristocrats such as the coquettish
Isabelle Cigny, the rogue trader Tocquet, the voudou priestess Claudine Arnaud and the
military chameleon Captain Maillart. The mulatress, Nanon, who figures prominently in
the storylines of the first and second books, All Souls Rising and Master of the
Crossroads, recedes in the background as the faithful and loving wife of the ever-in-war,
but gentle and indestructible doctor Antoine Hébert. Dr. Hébért is one of the few figures
who makes it out alive in all three novels despite many a brush with death. The doctor is
remembered fondly by Toussaint for his loyalty, and even Dessalines, who has an
avowed hatred of whites, treats the doctor as “Li nég”, a true citizen and therefore an
honorary Black, and spares the doctor the massacre that he visits on the remaining French
in the colony at the novel’s end.

Adding dimension and depth to the cast of adults and children, however, are two
re-appearing characters that make the story of the life of the revolutionary leader
complete. They are Toussaint’s sons, Placide and Isaac, who are escorted back to the
island on the orders of Napoleon Bonaparte. Bell does an incredible job of finally
humanizing the military strategist and statesman when he presents the tender and
powerful reunion scene between Papa Toussaint and his sons.

Placide snapped upright in the bed, realizing that what he heard was
the beat of shod hooves in the drive outside. He jumped into his
trousers and in a flash was out the front door — his mother a pace or
two behind him. A squadron of cavalry had pulled up in the oval drive
below the gallery, and the men were just beginning to get down from
their horses.... There was his father, his silhouette plainly
recognizable, between the two banners hanging slack against their
poles.... When they wrapped their arms around each other, Placide
realized he was much the taller. How could that have been so? Then
Isaac rushed to join them with an impact that rocked them on their
feet. Awkwardly they climbed the stairs, loath [sic] to let each other
go.”
