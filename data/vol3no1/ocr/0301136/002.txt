A REVIEW OF MADISON SMARTT BELL’S

THE STONE THAT THE BUILDER REFUSED
(Pantheon Books 2004.)

Haiti is definitely in need of more literary histories that celebrate the grandeur of
its illustrious achievement of being the first free Black republic in the western
hemisphere. It is only fitting then, that Madison Smartt Bell chooses to release the final
part of a trilogy that glorifies this daring accomplishment during the bicentennial
celebration of Haiti’s successful revolution against slavery and freedom from French
colonial rule.

The Stone that the Builder Refused is truly a masterpiece of literary history that
draws its readers into the world of complex social and familial relationships against the
detailed backdrop of military strategies and battles between the Haitians and the French
for the old colony of Saint Domingue. In 1801 Toussaint, the “gilded African” as he was
called by Napoleon, presented a new Constitution that abolished slavery in the colony
and made him Governor-General for life. He also sent former slaves back to the
plantations for better hours with remuneration and established a leadership that was
backed by a powerful army.’ These historical facts are the central ideas upon which Bell

builds his grand narrative that blends reality, fiction and myth to flesh out the history of

"C.L.R. James. The Black Jacobins. (Vintage, 1989). P. 243.
