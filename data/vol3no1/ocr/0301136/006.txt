undoing of its possession and control of the colony. Later, history teaches that Dessalines
as emperor repeats the same costly mistake when he kills all the remaining whites after
independence is declared. Two years after independence Dessalines was murdered by
political rivals.

For all the fascinating intrigue, personal histories and historical drama that the
book presents, occasionally it falls shy of its promised thoroughness. There are some
unfinished plot lines and weak narrative techniques that tend to leave the reader feeling
somewhat cheated and even alienated from certain character. For example, Elise
Tocquet, one of the holdover white women, has an exchange with her daughter Sophie
who has a dramatic outburst during a trip with some soldiers to Toussaint’s mansion.
Nowhere is an explanation given for the girl’s behavior, though it interrupts the narrative
with a force that promises some revealing resolution, possibly involving a lecherous
soldier named Cyprien. That promise is never fulfilled and readers are left wondering at
the reason for its placement at that point in the story, indeed in the novel at all.

Additionally, there is a definitely unsatisfying moment when a central figure and
personal aide to Toussaint, Guiaou, is inauspiciously killed by one of the young French
soldiers who accompanied Placide and Isaac to Haiti. Readers might feel a little cheated
at the easy death of such a strong character who single-handedly overpowered his captors
when imprisoned in the hull of a ship, who fought hardily and bravely in the first years of
the civil war, and who was always able to resist capture or harm. It is this same Guiaou
who fought with Riau in Master of the Crossroads for the honor of a woman that they
eventually shared. Riau narrates the circumstances of Guiaou’s death in a first person
narrative that is one of the stylistic features of the novel. While Bell’s experimentation
with voice is commendable, the first-person strategy renders Riau’s character as
unreflective and distances the reader from the speaker in those parts of the book where
we hear his narration.

However, overall the book is a fascinating read, if for no other reason than that
Bell bears out the theme that his title suggests. The stone that the builders refused can
refer to Toussaint and his ideas for a free Haiti. In their rejection of Toussaint, the
French rejected the dream of a nation that could balance racial factions, could maintain a

successful plantation economy that rewarded its workers, and could produce successive
