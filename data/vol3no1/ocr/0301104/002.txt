FOREST

I Night Through Branches

The deepest mother.

In many ways, unforgiving.

You imply claws, fur —

that which is long lost to me.

And the sorrow that craves me forward.
An owl looks down at me;

I beg for a single stroke of her secrets.

IT Nocturnal

Eyes glint like new copper pennies.

A bird song tingles its vein through tree tops.
A slim red fox thirsts for the lake’s cool mist.
A bear lays her head on moss, sniffs the air
for hidden honeys; flower’s night-nectars.

III This is the Experience — I don’t know what it Means

We found a patch of wild blackberries.

I said, Taste the veins of God.

You said, Hurry back to me — your eyes have ferned.
Black butterflies darken the sky,

their hearts, humming garnets,

the roots who spoke our names.
