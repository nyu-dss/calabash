IV Your Appetite Will Make You Aim

She trusts her hunger and faces

jaws poised to snap her in half.

Her arrow whistles down the guarded darkness,
Sinks deep and bright blood lights the way.

steps into the carcass mouth, which is her mouth;
nestles into her tongue’s bed.

rocks; unexpected pockets —
the frog knows them all.

You have no choice but to spread your legs,

blossom for the birds.
