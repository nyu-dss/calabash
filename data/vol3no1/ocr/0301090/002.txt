OCEAN

I’m riding the D train to Brooklyn (PC skills in just 2 weeks, pay
per view, Claritin-D, Decision VI contra la SIDA) on my way to
teach poetry in Brighton Beach. It’s about 8:30; I haven’t eaten
yet.
(I'm on a diet that”ll go belly up at 4pm).
Walking to the subway
I was thinking about great writers--
Mahfouz and Tolstoy, Edith Wharton, Balzac--
I was also thinking about the ocean (a chord effect),
thinking that when a writer gets really immersed it’s like bathing in
the ocean, a baptism from which she/he returns renewed. I picture
the black book of Rukeyser poems on the barstool next to my bed,
think about her intense phrase flow; sky, sun on brick houses--my
train’s going

elevated now--sometimes
I feel spirits

buoying me up.
