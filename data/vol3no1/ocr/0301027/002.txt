HAMILTON DANIEL

One those islands, people lived close to the land. Which is to say close to nature.
Right up close against life and death, birth and helplessness. My mother told me this
story about her father, Hamilton Daniel, my grandfather, a man I met only once when I
was about six. My only impression is that of a tall man with light brown skina nd a sharp
nose whose general features resembled those of my mother. I remember he picked me
up, called me by a nickname and bounced me around for a bit. The house he lived in was
a shack close to a rapidly moving stream. I recall going into that stream to catch tadpoles
and being warned not to wander into the middle or strong current would take me away.

My mother didn’t like her father, she told me many years later. “He was a hard
man who didn’t understand that girls are different to boys.” She was the only girl among
four brothers and Hamilton apparently treated her with the same brusque indifference he
treated his sons. “Thing is, they could stand up to him. They were men. But me, I didn’t
know what to do so I used to hide and cry.”

Relationship with her brothers was different. “My brothers were brothers but they
also were protectors, too. With Garfield because he was younger I used to fight. Wilmot
was always serious so I used to listen whenever he told me anything. And Bob, the one I
named you after ws more like a father than my father. He used to look out for me and
every so often ask for no reason, “Marie, how you getting on?”

“But Papa had no softness. He didn’t have time for weakness. And anybody who

wasn’t tough in the way some mountain people can be tough, in his mind was weak.
