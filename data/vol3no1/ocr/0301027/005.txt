“Ben, was married once but his wife ran away with another man. After that, Ben
never bothered much with anybody. Only Papa.

One Sunday, for no reason that anybody could explain, while we all was at
church, Ben dressed himself in his best white suit, sat out in yard, then took a razor and
cut his throat. People passing by screamed. Nobody know what to do. He was just
sitting there fluttering, covered all over with blood. Somebody said, “Send for Hamilton
Daniel,” so they did. Papa call out, “Murie, come with me.” I was just back from church
so I had to go in my good church clothes.

When we got there, all I could see was blood. Nobody wanted to go near Ben or
touch him. But Papa walk up like there was nothing there. He turn Benny’s head this
way and that. Brush the blood away with his hand and said, “This man ain’t gon die.
Clean him up and take him to the hospital.” I told you the hospital was 30 miles away.
But they did and do you know, Papa was right. Ben had cut his throat but he didn’t cut
his jugular vein. So even with all that loss of blood, he loss of blood, he lived. In fact,
he lived longer than Papa who saved him.

“How did Gramp know the cut wasn’t fatal?” I asked. My mother shrugged, “He
used to butcher animals for us to eat. Pigs, goats, sheep. When you do that often, you
learn the various parts of the body. That’s all I could figure.

“T have no nice memories of your Grandfather,” she said once again. “He was too

rough. And sometimes people need to be a little soft in life.”
