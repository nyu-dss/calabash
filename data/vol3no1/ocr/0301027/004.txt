“When I told your Grandfather, he hit me and called me a dirty no-good. Some
women who lived close by helped me through the confinement and I had a boy I named
Garfield. Papa said, “He’ll come to no good naming him after that scamp.” But Papa
then liked the baby and used to take him everywhere he went to show off what was then
his first grandson. But Gar wasn’t well. Midwife said he was born with a sickness. Papa
though he could cure him with boiled bush water and other kinds of herbs, but he was
only getting worse. And since we didn’t have no doctor in town, Papa had to take him 30
miles to the hospital. Bob, my brother, say if he was there, we woulda take him to
Bigtown. But this was 1935 and we didn’t have things like telephones. In our whole
village, there was only two cars.

“Gar stopped breathing about three hours after we got him to the hospital. We
coulda buried him there, but Papa said, “No. Family get buried on family land.” So we
took him back and buried him behind the house. After that I couldn’t stay home no more.
There was nothing to hold me. So six months later when Bob came to visit I asked him
to take me to Bigtown. Papa got mad and told me if I leave I would never amounts to
anything. I would just be a whore all my life. Bob told him to “Shut up!” and told me to
follow him. I worked in Bigtown for eight months and then I left for St. Kietts. That’s
how I left the island.”

“Your grandfather was a tough man. When he was young, he dig for gold in
Brazil. When he was a little older, they say he was in with a very bad set of men.
Something happened. Ramor it that he or one of his fellows he was with killed a man
and he came back home. But he bought land, married my mother and had all of us. She

died when I was three and Garfield was just a baby. After Papa brought us up.

:-’T remember an incident,” she said. “Maybe this will give you and idea about
your grandfather.”

“He had a friend named Ben that he used to drink with. Ben was the opposite of
Papa. Quiet, nice, soft. He used to give us children pennies sometimes. We all liked

him.
