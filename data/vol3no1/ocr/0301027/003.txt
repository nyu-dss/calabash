“T used to wash the clothes, cook the food, clean the house and when that was
finished, help Papa in the bakery. [ll say this for him. He was a man who knowed how
to make good bread.

“Wilmot used to fight with him because Wilmot said we should expand the
business. But Papa say the place was his and any change Motty make would be over his
dead body. When he couldn’t take it no longer your Uncle Wilmot left and went to
England.

“Bob was intelligent so he went to school in Bigtown. People say he coulda been
a lawyer but he didn’t have the money to pay for the schooling. So he became a
policeman.

Motty in England sent word that he had go married. People told Papa the wife
was ten years older than Motty and ugly. Papa laughed, “See, I told you that boy
wouldn’t amount to much. He wouldn’t listen to me. How look what he stuck with.”

Garfield was so bad all along that nobody expected much from him. One day we
got word that he shot a man in a gambling game, then went to sea with some cutthroats.
All Papa could say is “Lord, I hope that boy don’t die before I get to talk to him once
more.”

None of us die. All of us survive. Wilmot is back home now running the bakery
with his wife and six children. Bob, as you know, is Chief of Police. And Gar settled
down with Sylvanie and those 5 children although they say he got 36 more spread out all

over those islands.”

I had always thought I was my mother’s first born. She told me that wasn’t so.
There had been another before me, born while she still lived at home.

“T was seventeen and didn’t know what I was doing. The fellow used to come in
the bakery and smile to me. He use dot talk soft and I was happy to be round somebody
who was just nice. So we used to meet after everybody was asleep. I think he really
cared for me. But when I told him I was pregnant, he got scared. Said my father was a
mean man who would try to beat or maybe kill him. So he left to I have no idea where. I

just remember one day people say he was gone. And that was it.
