“Yes, tis. But wha you ain’ say is deh’s mo’. You tink people judgin’ you.
Because you took up wid dat high falutin’, wicked boy everybody buh you could see was
evil, an’ he went an make you look like a fool, jus’ wha’ any bad man woulda do wid you
actin like such a fool. An’ den cause you next go an get youself in de family way by any
ol’ wormy apple wha’ fall off de tree. An’ den you went an’ quit school even doh dey
was gon lea’ you stay and try make something a youself, an’ now you heh widout chit nor
chile and you tink we judgin’ you.” Mrs. Milligan took another deep breath, “an’ you
right.”

Lorraine’s head snapped up, “I thought you was gon’ try an make her feel better,”
she said.

“Of course we judgin’ you. So wha? You hear me? So what? You ain’ spread
off dere judging de rest a we? You calling me nosy. So wha’ now? You ‘speck me ta
run go hide from you? Not ta share me coconut candy wid you no more? Not to ask you
to come take me curtains down when dey need to wash? No. Don’ run from people,
chile. Come out in de living room. We mournin’ Jakiel, we need to be togedda.”

“Shit, Millie, you’s a two hundred fifty pound waste a time,” said Lorraine.

Mrs. Milligan didn’t bother to respond. She’d known Lorraine when she was still
drowning the death of Gerald’s father in other men’s tears. Had seen her go from needful
of arms that held to distrustful of arms that trapped, burdened and beat. Thank God for
Leon, though, he was starting to help. Lorraine she’d deal wid later.

“Bring you bottle wid you, if you have ta. Ah gon’ wait right heh.”

Derecia didn’t want to look up. Didn’t want to see Miss Millie’s stonelike face.
She couldn’t escape it though, her image was there in her dead babies’ crib sheet. Pastel
sheep, flowers and fish formed the pattern between Miss Millie’s broad brown forehead
and jaw. Fishy eyes of still bright reddish brown, sheepish nose and flower teeth. Miss
Millie had out waited her before.

She got up, eyes on the ever swaying worn linoleum tiles. She stumbled once and
heard Miss Millie’s rumbling “das all right, chile,” as she followed Miss Millie’s leather
soled flats down the hall. You could tell Miss Millie had good legs when she was young
she thought.
