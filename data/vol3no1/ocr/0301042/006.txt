Derecia jumped up on the middle of the bed. Her black crepe dress hiked up
around firm hips and still soft belly. She waved the bottle widely in front of her and
jumped from bed to bed.

“Stop! Mommy, stop! Ah warnin’ you! Somebody gon’ gea hurt! Stop!”

“You?! You warnin’ me?! Well, wha’ kinda day dis is, no? Ah gon’ tear your
butt up, and de more mess you make in dis room, de worse it gon’ be!”

The door opened and faces of all ages and degrees of concern appeared. Mrs.
Milligan’s lilac bulk took up most of the doorway, but she was framed by Gerald, whose
flared nostrils and bitten lips signaled that he was ready to mash Mrs. Milligan through
the plasterboard wall if he had to, and Ameka, who burst out with the high pitched giggle
she was calling a laugh this week, and Pookie, who peeked through fingers covered in
barbeque sauce, and Leon, who looked bewildered, not sure if he had the right to yell, or
who to yell at.

“Wha goin’ on in heh?” Mrs. Milligan’s melodic bass, which always seemed to
come from her massive breasts, penetrated the other ruckus easily, even though she was
not the loudest.

“Mommy!” Lorraine noticed that her title exploded from Gerald with the tone of
command he used on his so-called friends.

“Derri getting beat! Derri getting beat!” Ameka chanted.

“Ah thought you say we s’ posed ta be nice ta Derri today,” Pookie said.

“Get out!” shouted Lorraine. “Get out, alla you!”

Derecia threw her legs out from under her and bounced butt first on the bed,
capping the bottle of rum with her thumb.

Mrs. Milligan sidestepped the others and closed the door in their faces.

“Millie, you too. ’'m handlin’ her.”

“Ah ain’ no horse,” mumbled Derecia.

“You doin’ a piss poor job of it, Lorraine. Now, Derecia, what all dis roogadoo
about?”

“Eh-Eh, Miss Millie.” Derecia turned the bottle of Cruzan up to her mouth and
drank while Mrs. Milligan clasped her hands under her ballooning stomach and waited.

Lorraine collapsed on the nearest bed.
