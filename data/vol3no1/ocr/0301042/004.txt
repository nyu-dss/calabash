put dem on the tray, no? What you standing round for? There’s reasons there’s so much
work for a family to do after a buryin’, you know.”

“No, Mommy, leave her alone.”

“And see if she got me bottle of Cruzan Gold in there with she. De liddle tief.”

Gerald balanced the tray of glasses in one hand and the bowl of ice in the other.
He kicked open the kitchen door, hoping Ameka wasn’t on the other side with a platter
full of chicken or something. “I ain’t going, Mommy.”

Lorraine sighed. It had been a long time since she’d been able to tell Gerald what
to do.

She passed Ameka in the hall carrying a pan of potato stuffing with Pookie behind
her struggling with a pot of rice and beans.

“Who all there?” she asked, regretting for the zillionth time that she’d have to go
through the living room to get to the bedrooms.

“A bunch a people. Miss Potter and Miss Soto and dat funny lookin’ lady wha’
always smell so stink, and Leon and Ray—*

But Lorraine was already there. She put on a grief-stricken dazed expression and
weaved through the crowd unstopped.

“Now Derecia, I know how you feel,” Lorraine began as soon as she closed the
door behind her, the room that housed the crib, the crib the baby barely slept in, so up in
arms was he, “but you gotta get up.”

Derecia lay on her back on the twin bed closest to the door. The bottle of rum
dangled from one hand while Jakiel’s crib sheet was pressed into service as part blanket
and part tissue by the other.

“How you gon’ know how I feel?” Derecia tried to root herself deeper into the
cushiness of the soft mattress.

At least she can still talk, thought Lorraine.

“Because everybody knows pain. Everybody knows sorrow. That’s why all these
people here today. Trying to....trying to... say they’re sorry too. Trying to share the
load of grief with you. Come on, get up and show some respect for the consideration

they’re showing you.”
