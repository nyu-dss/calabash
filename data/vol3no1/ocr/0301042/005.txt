“Dat’s bullshit, Mommy. Dey here for the party. For the food and some a dis
rum. Buh, dat’s whey dey lose out.” Derecia tipped the bottle to her lips, like an
experienced drunk, Lorraine thought, “becharse...because Ah ain’t sharing. And Ah
ain’t goin’ out dere neida.”

“You gotta get up. I need you to help me. Derri, there’s food to set out and
glasses to fill, and yes, I tell you, condolences to accept. They can’t give you your son
back, but you gon’ have to take what they can give. Get up, baby.”

“Well, if day can’ gea me wha Ah wan’, wha Ah mus do wid dem? Ah don’ need
look dere ugly faces jus to hear dem say wha dey s’ pose to say, is all poppyshow,
anyhow.”

She shifted her gaze to the ceiling. “No, I ain’ goin’ out dey. Ah wish everybody
jus’ drop dead. Jus’ drop dead...lak...like Jakiel. Jus’ wake up dead.”

Lorraine looked at her eighteen year old daughter, the most confused of her four
children. Half the tears she’d cried in the last five days had been for Derecia. Derecia,
with her smile as powerful as high noon thundershowers and her far flung ambitions, now
forgotten. Derecia, who was so smart in so many ways, and so astonishingly dumb in
others. The girl really didn’t seem to know what had happened to her life during the past
year and a half. And she didn’t have a clue as to how to go on either, how to piece
together the semblance of a functional woman from the shattered leftovers of a child.

“You get up and go out in the living room right now, ‘fore I give you wha’ Polly
gea’ de drum!” Lorraine found herself yanking open the closet door, almost as if her
body moved instinctively, “Ah ain’ axin’ you! Ah tellin’ you! Do it now, else Ah whip
you ass and den you s#i// goin’ out.”

She wrestled a wide red plastic belt off a hanger as Derecia watched, ready to
spring to the other side of the bed, not sure how far her mother would really go.

Lorraine started showering the air with blows as soon as she had a good grip on
the belt. The third swing caught Derecia on the toes. She curled up and rolled over, the
open bottle of rum going with her, sloshing onto her clothes and soaking the bed.

“Get up, you fool! Look what you doin! You gon’ have de place stinkin’ like de drunk

you tryna play! Stop dis silliness and act like you got good sense
