Calabash

A JOURNAL OF CARIBBEAN ARTS AND LETTERS

(A MOROCCAN SONG)

Casablanca

at night

phosphorescent city

orange building rectangles
through Zouhra’s apartment
windows

by day

the gray Atlantic

from 9 stories high

(her mountain windows)

afternoon wind
conversation on her
worn couch and chairs—
sweet tea

gold-trim tea glasses
a few biscuits—
Zouhra’ s—

family way-station
stopover

en route to

en route from

from our Marrakesh
honeymoon

we bring her cookies
shaped like pebbles,

a polished wood egg—
from the Rabat zoo

my imitation of a giraffe
