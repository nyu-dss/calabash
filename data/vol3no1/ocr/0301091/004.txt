Zouhra, the well’s pail—
down

9 flights of stairs—
up

9 flights of stone—
empty

full

empty—

empty

full

empty—her day’s
rhythm

38 3

night—

one weak bulb

lights the iron-grille
ascenseur

the long-dead ascenseur
metamorphosed

into a huge wastebasket

after the day’s
journey

our bags stuffed
with petites contes
we climb the dark
stairway

climb

climb

climb

climb
the dark

dark
stairway
‘til the high windows

‘til the shining orange buildings
