microscopic life episodes
make Zouhra

and her daughters
laugh—

goats, the hammam’s vapors

a farmer’s hand-ploughed field
move through

her living room—

a conversation museum

38 3

late afternoon—

the magazine kiosk

in front of

the tall white building—
pharmacy in shadows
across the street—

the view from

Zouhra’ roof—
blowing swatches of
colored laundry—

pale lemon sun
cream-color buildings—
nostalgia twisting

my chest—

nostalgia

slanting

and pulling

38 3

Zouhra the tree—
her dark beautiful
daughters

the ornaments—

chubby in her pale green djellaba—

brackish-pool eyes
(so many mouths

to feed)
Zouhra breeding schemes
