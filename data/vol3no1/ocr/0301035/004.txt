“How much for that one?” she asked, pointing.

“That one is no good, this one better.”

He held up a plant for her viewing.

“But it look so bad.”

“Unlike you, but it have good potential.”

She ignored his amateur attempt at a compliment.

“Will it flower for Easter?”

“T sure about that. But let me keep it and take care of it so I could make sure.
Collect it when you come by again.”

“Before Easter?”

“By Easter.”

She walked off to join her friend, making sure that her path contained no
intervening stall that would block his view of her retreating body.

Martha had deliberately moved off when Joanna made her way over to Michael’s
stall.

Several times Martha had started to signal to Joanna of what her body had done to
her during the final weeks of her abuse, responding of her father’s embrace despite her
revulsions of him and his touch, as if her body had a will of its own, so that beside her
silent screams and tears, she would dig her nails into her own flesh to short circuit her
body’s betrayal. Her aborted signals had started to ask Martha if she had ever had those
feelings. What if they were coupled with love? How would it feel?

When next Michael saw Joanna in the village, he asked, in a continuation of their
last conversation.

“When you going to pick it up?”

A query he had to almost hurl at her, so quickly was she walking by.

She stopped.

“When you going to give it?”

He was startled by the manner of her answer. She had stopped and stared into his
face, passing her hand over her hair as she did so.

“When are you going to give it?”
