A GIFT OF EASTER LILIES

The market place way typical of those found throughout the island. A long open
shed covered by galvanized iron, the ground wet from the water leaking from vegetables
sprinkled continuously to keep them fresh looking, the smell of sweat, noise and an all
pervading smell of rot.

Michaelâ€™s presence was notable among the other vendors in that he was always
neat in appearance. Considered handsome by the female vendors, he was of indeterminate
race, always carrying a small towel on his shoulder, which he continuously used to wipe
sweat from his face.

It was there that Joanna, the young attractive red woman, whose features and
penchant for colorful clothing spoke of her Spanish background, first noticed him.

That was three years ago, and although their eyes always made four, they had
never spoken to each other. However, it was dutifully observed by the other vendors, that
although she had never bought
anything from him, she would always walk past his stall, her gait becoming almost
imperceptibly slower as she did so.

Two weeks before Easter, she paid her usual visit to the market, walking through
it hand in hand with Martha, a young lady who mimicked her in resemblance, clothes and
mannerisms and who was her constant companion. Among the vendors, rumours had
circulated, beginning from their first visit to the market. It was said that they were lovers

by gossips, while those with a more generous spirit credited their closeness to friendship.
