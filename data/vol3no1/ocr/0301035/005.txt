An uncertain query, a subtleness almost lost in the myriad of sounds enveloping
them, an offer, a request, a plea, all at the same time.

“How?” His voice was just as questioning. Unconsciously imitating hers.

“You know where I live, let me know when you ready.”

This time her voice was a whisper of wind in the coconut trees, the sound of
waves weeping on the shore after a night of being frayed by the wind, a dry coconut
falling with a thud on the sandy beach.

“Look for shadows in the moonlight.” He replied, walking away with effort.

The full moon cut huge swathes of light across the beach. The coconut trees, long,
slim sentinels of the night, cast irregular shadows, creating a patchwork of darkness and
light, a crazy checkerboard in the night.

Michael listened to the breeze outside. It was as strong as it always was, blowing
offshore and cold. It forced a sighing sound from the tree branches, giving a soundtrack
to the light quilted night. He came off his bed and walked outside, making his way over
to her house. When he reached his destination he stood in the moonlight so that he cast a
long shadow that climbed up her wall and over her window.

She saw the shadow cross her window and came off her bed. Naked to the waist
she walked over to her window. Denied the sun, her breasts were white. He could not see
her face, only those two breasts, framed in the window.

Michael turned and walked slowly toward the mattress factory. He did not turn to
look, but he knew that Joanna was behind him.

In her hand she carried two blankets. She had hurriedly pulled on a tee shirt that
reached to her knees.

In the mattress factory she spread the blankets on a long abandoned mattress and

holding his hand she pulled him to her.

They spent the night in its dark embrace, embracing, his only reason to relieve
himself of a ponderous tumescence, she to answer questions for her friend.
She awoke before him. It was still cold outside, the sun just beginning to shed

light on the morning as she walked home.
