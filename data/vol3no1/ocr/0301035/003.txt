They lived together in a house in the village close to the market. It was commonly
known as the Mattress Village because of the fact that it once had a thriving mattress
factory that was a primary source of employment for the villagers. It utilized the fiber
from the coconut estates that ringed the village. With the advent of synthetic foam for the
making of the mattresses, the demand for the fiber-based mattresses came to an end and
the factory was forced to close. The owner simply did not open the doors one morning
and the factory had stood there ever since, the corpse of a by-gone era, the lock having
long since broken off, the mattresses inside, in various stages of production, still stacked
against the wall.

Joanna and Martha lived in the village, not far from Michael, the mattress factory
lying between both houses. They had moved into the village about five years previously,
in a house willed to Joanna by a father she hardly knew, a belated apology for neglect.
Despite the proximity of both their houses, their deliberate disregard for each other
continued, even within the village.

Of Martha, the villagers knew little. The truth being that she was a neighbor of
Joanna in the village in which they had previously lived. She was a deaf mute. Growing
up together as children, they had worked out a system of hand signals and face
movements, which allowed them to communicate with each other.

Martha was however embarrassed to do this in public, so it was never done in the
presence of others.

Martha was about thirteen when the signals that spoke of the horror began, thus
Joanna, over the next three years, came to know of the abuse Martha endured at the hands
of her father. He never knew of signals, and never suspected that Joanna knew of his
incest.

They were both sixteen when Joanna inherited the house and a monthly stipend,
from her father. It was a timely occurrence. Using the Carnival season as an excuse, they
fled the village, never to return. Martha’s father, fearing police investigation, claimed that
they were both adults who had left home and frustrated all efforts to trace their
whereabouts.

On that pre-Easter visit, Joanna saw Easter lilies being sold at Michael’s stall.

Together they made their way over. Martha attracted by goods at another stall drifted off.
