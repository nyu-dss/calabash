CASTING SPELLS
(for Nazirah and Nehessaiu)

ActI SceneI: At the crossroads in Squaw Valley, California

[Enter the three witches]

When shall we three meet again,
in thunder lightening or in rain?
When the hurly burly’s done,
When the battle’s lost and won.
Then the magic will be on.
Where the place?

New York, Rhode Island, or DC,
There to stir up creativity.

Witch 1: I must awaken the people
Witch 2: Pll give them hope
Witch 3: Pll use my sixth finger....
[Exeunt]

ActI Scene III: An airport somewhere on the East Coast of the USA
[Enter the three witches]

Where hast thou been sistah?

Killing swine.

Sistah, where thou?

A brother thought he had a serious rap,

And talked, and talked, and talked: “Silence,” qouth L-
“Later for you, witch!” the trifling negro cries,

He on a business trip is gone, to close a deal.

But on a metaphor I'll thither sail

And with my art Pll make him fail;
