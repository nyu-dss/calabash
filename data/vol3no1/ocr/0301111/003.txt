I'll do, I'll do, I'll do.

Witch 1: I'll give thee a sharp word

Th’art kind.

Witch 3: Pll lend you my sixth finger

I myself have all the other.
[Voices fade. Dim lights to black]

ActIV Scene I: Gasparee Caves, Trinidad. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.

[Enter the three witches]

Round about the cauldron go;

In the poison’d entrails throw.

Eye of molester, liar’s tongue,
Sappho hater, lovers gone;

Thigh and wishbone, neckbone too,
Stir them in there, fix a stew;
Absent father’s old gold tooth,
Secretive mother’s vow of truth,
Nappy hair strand coiled and strong,
Black girl’s genetics hidden long.
Double, double toil and trouble:
Fire burn; and, cauldron, bubble.
Cool it with agouti’s blood;

Then the spell is firm and good.
