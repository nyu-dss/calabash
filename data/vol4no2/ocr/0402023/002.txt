bolster their fledging ego or assuage their own
feelings of being unloved.

i didnâ€™t know
what need was
until i met him

I seek the wick that burns clean the din that says
every woman should love herself secondary to the one
who loves her.

i would gladly
forego who iam
to his custody

and yet it is said
there is no joy

in the cup of life
if there is no love
