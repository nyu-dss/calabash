Fiah fi di man who build di firs fence

An im fren who sign paypa as evidence

Spin doctors assuring innocence

We might as well swallow; you think that we should
With a name like democracy it’s got to be good

Fiah fi di man who build di secan fence

Trick poor people wid im innocence

Only think about im own existence

Imparting what god said cause he understood
With a name like democracy it’s got to be good

Fiah fi di man who build di tird fence

Fatten im belly from violence

Rule power an glory an consequence

Cain destroyed Abel because he could

With a name like democracy it’s got to be good

Fiah fi di man who build di fourt fence

Sell poison wid indifference

Entrepreneur minus conscience

Who seize the free market in my neighborhood
With a name like democracy it’s got to be good
