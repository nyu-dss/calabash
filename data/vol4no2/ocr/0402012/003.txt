Zewa held her own,
a quiet mourning,
did not baw] down
her young belly,
did not then know
how very much

she would need you
to teach her

how to manage

the canepiece

and husband,

and the flock,

as well how

to get blood

from a stone.

She honored you
with anthems

at morning

and with vespers
at the dusk,

and made it so
that no man
could speak

your name
except with

an inclination

to worship,

her mother,
Annie, our queen
in Frederiksted
with her face
against the sun,
still remembering
the Mountain
called Misery
and all those

she left to its care.
