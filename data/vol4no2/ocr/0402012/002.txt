the water.

Maybe then,

with fear and
with knowing,
taken together,
you might perhaps
have chosen

to make

this island place

a lasting home,
and to wait

with the land

so you could keep
our company
when it was

our time

to come down
from heaven.

But no doubt
that other things
were meant to be
and that not even
our lion king,

the man called
Freeman Garvey
with strong loins
blazing fire, loins
which took you
to deathâ€™s door
six times over,
that he neither
could inspire you
to condemn the sea.

Then on that day,

all the sinners

who could stand

to suffer more,

they gathered

and watched you sail,
watched you work
the cruel wind

to make of us

a tribe bereaved.
