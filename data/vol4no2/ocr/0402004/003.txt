is not over. Perhaps it is now part of what it means to be Caribbean. Brooklyn or Miami
might vie just as convincingly for “Capital of the Caribbean” as Kingston or Port-of-
Spain. There are two poems in this gathering entitled “Exile” one by Basil Warner, the
other by Raymond Mair.

Contemporary Caribbean poets, like good surgeons, study under the more
experienced: George Lamming, Louise Bennett, Derek Walcott, Aimé Césaire and even
Joseph Brodsky are paid respect in these poems. Walcott is mentioned in more than one
poem and Mark McMorris offers an essay on “Encountering Walcott after the 1970s.” In
this collection there are teachers present alongside students. Many of the younger poets
can count Eddie Baugh, Mervyn Morris or Kwame Dawes among their mentors. Baugh
and Morris both appear in the collection. This means something: That not only is there
an audience, a community, of Caribbean poetry, but there might also be something of a
family.

Here is the quiet fearful truth.

In the community fire everything gets blazed: “straw dolls, Hey Mon/T-shirts,
African statues made in Japan...the cries or Prettygirl/and Walcott poems.” This is
Christian Campbell’s “A Dream of Fire.” A dream where poetry is hawked on the street
besides “knock-off Louis Vitton bags.” There is something very beautiful and very
radical about this. Dear E.M. Roach, this is the thing that was so soft you couldn’t hear.

This is the thing that is saving us.
