like learning to be a surgeon—it should be taken seriously as a practice. Yes. You have to
observe first. You have to study under the more experienced. You have to practice on
dead things. You have to be blessed with good hands. Go even further: You have to be
very careful—you can kill people or you can save people. Opal Palmer Adisa’s “Both
Sides” says that “Only a woman bent on suicide would fall in love. The/ very
description—fall in—signals a fatal act.” We have to be willing to face the fatality to be

time Tregenza. The musician is present as poet: rapso with Paula Obe, dub poetry with

through a rhythmic reverberation. To be heard at Rock Lounge in the Virgin Islands or
Izahvibe in Trinidad or Calabash in Jamaica. The West Indian is constantly building
more communities by being living in various world communities: England, the US,
Canada, Africa and the West Indies, publishing and reading in even more places.

The Caribbean is still a space of transience and change, a place that is still the
amazing thing of a culture being born, right here in modern times (gem for
anthropologists and writers). We are a region of migrants and immigrants. Puerto Ricans
live in the air, goes one saying. We move. From Barbados to St. Maartin. From St. Kitts

to Santo Domingo. And the most radical move both in body and spirit has always been

the move to the cold, colonial countries. This period of Caribbean history, the migration,
