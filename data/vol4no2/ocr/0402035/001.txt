IN MIAMI IMMIGRATION

I wanted to say to the Immigration Officer,

as my mother would say to me,

‘If you give a cup of water to even the least of these’ --
at our kitchen door she’d always give

a cup of water -- but I was from a kick-stool country
at the end of the almighty boot,

and corralled with a friend into a pen

where fathers with stripped eyes gave sons quick tips
in how-not-to-be-a-man-though-you’re-not-yet-a-man,
and mothers, zipped up in body-bags of silence,
stuffed babies’ mouths shut with milk.

Beside me, my friend had fallen silent too,

worrying a red-on-brown bead on his hand,

and I should have laid my hands

on his and said, “With a friend here, it’s not so bad.’
But I was pretending the wait was only

like back home at some civil service office.

Three tired hours from the plane, where he’d eaten salt,
my friend, without a sip of water,

popped his heart pills. And I kept begging,

Please, God, no strip search, remembering stories
about knives poking Mama’s Christmas pudding.

T have come to a still, but not a deep center,
A point outside the glittering current...

‘This isn’t the place,’ he said, ‘to read Roethke.’
For we’d crossed over river to black water.

Hours downstream and two mock questions later
