they let me go. I waited outside for him like
one of those women watchers who,

with the patience of cattle under a sodden tree,
line our Penitentiary’s sullen walls,

each hoping prisoners will appear by day’s end
so she can go home knowing he is safe.

Every time the door opened, once every minute
for three hours, and his silver hair and yellow T-shirt
did not appear, another chance slipped

into a pit emptied of everything

but waiting, like a defeat unspoken because,

as my mother said, ‘With the mouth you make confession.’
So it was best to avert the eyes,

but look for a room for the night and eat

ashes. (It was eight hours and he hadn’t eaten, no water,
and the ticketing agent had said,

‘If they don’t come out after five hours, that’s it!”)

Returning to my watch, I found

everything flipped

over, a revolving billboard. The air clanged shut.

The young guard who could have been my son

was gentle, but “You can’t go back’;

he must keep to the rules. I was grateful

for the dew-pond in his voice, like a sip of water

after fever, the first rain on the skellion beds

of a St. Elizabeth farmer, or the wine and wafer,

grief-bread on a parched tongue, after nights without tears —

And I took it all
into my body.
