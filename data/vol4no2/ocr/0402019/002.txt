they shake their gray-heads at the howl
of fire. A bird, a sea-swift, might think
it Soufriere. But it’s just a burning market.

Yes, the arsonist was inspired by “A City’s Death by Fire”:
After that hot gospeller had levelled all but the churched sky. . .

Il.

Walcott is safe, thank God, no longer
limps. Poems gone, poems gone.

But he knows them all by heart,

like the braiders. Poems gone,

he sucks his teeth and grumbles:
History. First time in Nassau,

last stop on the schooner Flight,

he paints the market skanking down

in flames, cigarette painting smoke, too,
from his mouth.

He paints one of the braiders

knitting my hair, diamond style,
chanting me a poem:

Open the map. More islands there, man,
than peas on a tin plate, all different size,
one thousand in the Bahamas alone. . .

A big-belly man is making conch

fritters to sell, so I don’t smell

poems burning. Only oil, batter,
bubbling conch.

Smoke barrels up like music.
The singed straw dolls lip-synch
Arrow: Olé Olé, Olé Olé. . .

and ya room-boom-boom-boom
(and for once the old man dance).

Bay Street burns like the sixties, like 1942.
Funky Nassau. There is no place like this.
Armagiddeon or obeah, only us.

Everyone knows what we like:

we like pretty. So what matters in the dream,
the scrap gangs running to catch ashes

of Walcott poems for new costumes

and how beautiful Bay Street will look

with a whole other mouth.
