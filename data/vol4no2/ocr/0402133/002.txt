Years ago my wife and I were having breakfast with Derek Walcott in the coffee
shop at Bloomingdales in New York when he announced that he was going to give up
poetry for painting. "Painting is more immediate. I am tired of the toil of poetry". I was
stunned and tried to record the incident in a poem entitled "In Contemplation of a Poet’s

Head” which ends:

Rapture is a risk all poets take.

You alone with pen or pallet will compose

the balance of your days.

For the bronze armory of bone give praise.
The words compose and balance can be read two ways. Compose can mean to tranquilize
agitation and it can mean to design harmonies; balance can mean getting proportions
right or it can mean what is yet to happen. Both senses work in recording Walcott’s
decision which, fortunately, he did not honour.

What is more transient, fragile and beautiful than the light of the world and where
is light more refulgent than in the Caribbean and my Jamaica? . Although transient, Light
is also a palpable presence in the tropics, a presence I have tried to capture in paintings
like PORT ANTONIO and SAN SAN BAY. But in painting the landscape of the West
Indies one has to be careful not to sentimentalize scenery just as one has to shun
romanticizing poverty in poetry.

In PORT ANTONIO the village shacks at the water’s edge could have been
painted as social propaganda. Instead I chose to simplify (purify?) the shapes and make a
pattern of their repetition. The slash of light across the harbor serves to define its
curvature and at the same time to undercut mere realistic perspective. SAN SAN BAY is
suffused with light but is another example of creating distance without traditional
perspective. The stylized angle of the jetty and the line of bathers forms an arrowhead
which points to the horizon and pulls the viewers eyes into the picture.

My obsession with light overflows into my poetry. In the prologue to "View from

Mount Diablo" the opening lines report the dialectic of light and dark.

The light that I have so long loved turns

Its gaze grudgingly from the old, romantic view

Of islands, from the stubbled silver sheen of mountains
Guarding villages waking from their sleep, dew
