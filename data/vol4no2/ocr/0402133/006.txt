feeling the animation of its steel

between my legs, pedal elevated,

head hanging over handle bars,

rocking from side to side.

Then the glide down South Camp road

spokes spinning in refracted light.
In this case the poem came considerably earlier than the painting and was the direct
inspiration for it.

Cityscapes are a subtext of landscapes. My painting KINGSTON NORTH is an
attempt to explore the odd combination of ramshackle and the modern which is
characteristic of our capital city. Kingston is also unique in the amount of trees and
greenery that punctuate its buildings. But the most significant feature of the city is the
mountains standing guard over it.

I have painted them boldly so that their monumentality overwhelms the concrete

and steel of the modern buildings scattered throughout the composition. There is a

slightly different perspective in my poem "Third World" in which:

High rise hotels, concrete shoulders thrown back
stand like soldiers self-consciously at attention
while round their boots the third world city sprawls.

I started painting long before I tried my hand at poetry but have long since put
away my easel and my pallet. The challenges for a third world poet are formidable. The
anxiety of influence must not be allowed to bloom so abundantly that our gaze remains
fixed on our navels. On the other hand we need to free ourselves from the influence of
anxiety, the lack of self-esteem, which is the inheritance of slavery.

As Caribbean poets we must cherish the particularities that sparkle in our culture

while at the same time not hesitating to grapple with the universal verities which mark all

great poetry. It has been my privilege to be on the fringe of this great adventure.
