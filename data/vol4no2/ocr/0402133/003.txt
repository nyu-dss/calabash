Overflowing the green uplifted chalice of a leaf

Rhyme helps to discipline the emotion and the imperative to undercut sentimentality

seceeeeee now the dream

Is draining from the valley shadows, edges hardening

As the light changes to a harsh, uncompromising glare.
This day’s sun is turning cynical, taking

Its early morning tally in the tarnished air, a complacent
Prison warder twisting a thumb print into Kingston’s face -
At high noon a hawk circling a laden

Feeding tree, pure scrutiny without a trace

Of insight

Painters and poets share this in common - they must have ‘outsight’ as well as
‘insight’. The genesis of my painting LEDA was a look over my shoulder at Yeats’
"Leda" which equates the swan with the universal power of Eros. My insight was to
substitute lizard for swan, which in the Jamaican context records the ambivalent attitude
of Jamaican women who believe that if a lizard jumps on them they will get pregnant.
My painting exaggerates the size of the lizard in relation to the head of the bemused
woman, her body elongated between the red uprights of the chair on which she sits. I
have tried to capture a certain nobleness in the lizard’s pose and another important aspect
of the composition is that the planes of the painting, the carpet, the floor, the garden, the
sky, are all of the same tone to preserve the integrity of the surface of the canvas. This
eschews old-fashioned perspective and recognizes the reality of the medium we painters
and poets are forced to use to convey the message and the emotion.

Unconsciously connected I suppose, I wrote a poem entitled "Leda" which, as far
as the emotional reaction of a viewer or a reader is concerned, would instantly conjoin
Yeats’ swan and Thompson’s lizard, a type of instant communication and rapport
common to painting and poetry. The poem is more light-hearted than the painting. It
begins:

Why are we

black daughters of Jamaica
so afraid of lizards?
Confronted by such a wall
of prejudice I think
