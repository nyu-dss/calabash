commentary is easier in poetry than in painting. I have written a novel in verse, "View
from Mount Diablo", which traces and castigates political corruption in Jamaica since
Independence.

Jamaica is a fragmented society, socially, racially and economically. There are
those whose aesthetic in painting see abstract art as appropriate to reflect these
discontinuities. Walcott disagrees. Denizens of New York and Chicago who only know
concrete and skyscrapers may need to retreat into Expressionism but we who are
fortunate to live in the lush generosity of the tropics have a moral obligation to celebrate
it faithfully in our art. I take a middle ground. BROTHERS is an ironic abstract
composition which lives somewhere between realism, surrealism and the abstract. The
clich√© phrase "Brothers at Arms" cannot apply because two of the figures have no arms
yet there seems to be an embracing, one monolithic whole approaching sculpture. The
stylized arms of the middle figure of the trinity seem to be raised in prayer and the three
bowed heads convey an overall sacramental atmosphere.

There may be nothing specifically Jamaican about this painting but I feel it
reflects a universal humanity, strong and vibrant (check the colour harmonies) but
desperately locked into the need for solidarity. Oh, for this combination of humility and
strength in the Jamaican society.

Another non-realistic painting of mine is entitled CYCLING which was used on
the cover of my second poetry collection, aptly named "Moving On", cover and content
symbolic of the connectedness of the two disciplines. It is usually easier to capture speed
and movement in painting than in poetry but in a poem of mine with the title "My God" I

have tried to define space and time as follows:

Time is space unravelling and space
is the time it takes to trace the limits
which the pen has shaped.

CYCLING records my fascination as a youth with the bicycle. Back then the cycle was
the method of transportation for school boys and the working class. Only the rich had

automobiles. The poem counterpart to CYCLING contains these lines:

The leap upon the bike -
