ON WRITING & PAINTING

All art is an attempt to encode in a more permanent form the transientness of the
world-whether its beauty or its sorrow, its epiphanies or its tragedies but always with the
compulsion to share with others the joy of the creative process. All artists are
exhibitionists which is why painters exhibit and poets publish. As primarily a figurative
painter and primarily a narrative poet, the stuff of my work is plot (not pot). In painting I
get my highs with my eyes; in poetry imagination generates the greatest satisfaction. In
painting I strive to capture what I cannot see; in poetry I strive to lose what is no longer
needed.

TONY is a genre painting about a motorcycle accident, the victim immobilized in
a cast, dependent on a crutch. Subconscious symbols of submission? Perhaps. But there is
no mistaking the head as being that of a proud black man. I have a poem entitled "Death
of a Honda Rider", not connected with the painting in time, in which the victim is a
Rastafarian whose truth is hidden under his locks. The poem ends

.... amillion
revelations, spliff certified,
flared to a faith you could not face
unless you dared to ride the pillion
Notice the pun in the word face i.e. the physical act of looking forward or to confront.

Puns and ambiguity are possible and desirable in poetry. I do not think you can pun in

paint.
