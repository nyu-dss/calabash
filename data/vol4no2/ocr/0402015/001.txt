On the day

I forced you

from my womb,
precious daughter
I saw his face
your father,

and so believed
the loud chorus
of old women
who proclaimed
that with his features
you were born
for good fortune.

And in this way

I lived your life,
taking for granted
this blessing
which was yours,
while I gave

to the others

of my body

all I could spare
to mitigate

the suffering
which seemed
their part and parcel
to carry, to bear.
