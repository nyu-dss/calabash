are not safe

in the land

that did birth you
and night wind
sounds the call
that you must go.

I have made

my own peace

with the water

for each time

that I cursed it

to its core

for each wave

I disdained

which gave support
to that vessel

so it could dash forth
and carry me

from the only
world I knew.

I kept you

as I washed away
and though my eyes
grew old and weary,
until no single thing
no thing remained
to interrupt the sky.
Then to gaze
instead before me
so to discover

a world anew,
prepared to pay

the price of dreaming
in this raw life

so long as

breath sustains.

And know that

this old heart

did never once
forsake you
although beloved
you might recall best
the angry welts
