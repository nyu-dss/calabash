which I crafted.
onto your back
that childhood day
when in play

you set fire

to a canfield
before the harvest,
and I poor woman
was bereft

at the thought

of owing them

all of our lives

for such damage.

It pleases me

that you are woman
with a flock

to call your own
that in your eyes
you see me still,
but not martyr

not the sainted,
just as warrior
riding high

atop these lands
until we are called
into the fire.
