REVOLUTION AND REGGAE
(LIBERIAN COUP 1985)

Daylight is changing guard with night
and the radio blares “Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights”

No national anthem.

Suspicion is soon confirmed

a monotone voice interrupts

the laid back reggae tract

“The people’s Revolutionary Party
has taken over the government
stay calm, stay indoors.”

“Get up, stand up

stand up for your rights.”

Bob Marley doesn’t know
His song has been hijacked
And drummed into heads
Knees weak from fear

Do not allow us to stand up.

We gather round a kitchen table

uneasy because of the rat-tat-tat of gun fire
and the singing of drunk “patriots”
prematurely celebrating the coup d'état
celebrating the climb of tribesmen to power
counting on nepotism to rise in stature

to climb the social ladder.

We pray to ride out the storm
