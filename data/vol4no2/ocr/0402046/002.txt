‘cause a revolution like a hurricane can
change direction, leave death and destruction
in its path as it fights to stay alive.

We switch the radio off

some standing up for their rights

are taking men away

to unknown destinations

despite the pleas of wives and children.

The change brings death for some

Slaughtered by men putting them in their places
Showing who is the boss, exercising their rights
In the name of destiny and “Get up stand up,
Stand up for your rights,’ newfound anthem
Hostage of a nebulous cause.
