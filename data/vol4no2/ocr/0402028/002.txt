refused to split from the piercing of the sharpened nails of other tops, and his box trucks
that mirrored Lennox’s busses. Then there were the wood-knot balls he’d used against
the cypress-wood cricket bats. The bats with the bicycle-tube cushioned handles. I
remember the gummier sailing boats that voyaged across Meldrum Pond, Big Pond and
Dover Bay. In between him pointing to the one marked passage of his book to visitors, I
said these things to him and he shook his head and his eyes welled with tears.

But as adults we had grown apart. Like most creative people, he didn’t always
tow the line. This landed him in trouble mostly at home but sometimes at school and
resulted in some straps from our mom, which changed him little. I was, conversely, as
straight as a pin: I did—not!—tow the line, the line towed me! It was these differences
that served as a catalyst for our conflict over inheritance, which soon drove us apart. It
was stupid though: who should inherit what property is so very small in the overall
scheme of things.

I envied him. Now that I am looking back through the clairvoyant mirror that is
time I see it plainly. You see, I recall meeting a man from mainland, Grenada, who on
hearing that I was his brother proceeded to fete me to the limit of his means. The reason

dream about. Perhaps it was these things, since I’d had acquired much property on my
own, which had filled my sails in fussing over inheritance. I said this to him and he
shook his head as our eyes welled. It was inevitable: I suppose; that his illness had re-
cemented our bond.

The same man, who’d feted me years before on the mainland, came just before he
passed. It was for this man he’d last opened his book. It was for this man he’d last
pointed with a feeble finger the marked passage. The man, who understood the gravity of

a dying man teaching what might be his last lesson, tearfully read the passage out loud:
