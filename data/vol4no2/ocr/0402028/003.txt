Remember now thy creator in the days
of thy youth, while the evil days come not,
nor the years draw nigh when thou shall say,

I have no pleasures in them

The reading completed, a serene smile marked my brother’s face and he exhaled his final
breath.

Now that time had passed, I see that in dying he thought me how to live. His
exodus gave me unwritten scrolls in the shortness of life and the fullness of living. I
know now that next to love the most positive thing that happens to a person is death.
That death is not to be feared but embrace it with a might; that I should equate life and
death for if held the same there are no existential questions. It would be easier from now,
quite easier in fact, for my troubles will be lessened as I trod through this life I’m living.
And whenever I remember him hammering on the roof tops, sailing boats, making tops,
or bowling his left-handed medium pace his life’s lessons will forever hold fast in my
heart as the unmovable residential homes he built.

Still, I wish my enlightenment had come by other ways; that our story had
happened otherwise—but, it had not.
