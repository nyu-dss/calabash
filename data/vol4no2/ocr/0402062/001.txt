PROSPERO’S EDUATION

(on hearing George Lamming)

Stull,

We eat

their realities

like tasty food;
Pepperpot

Festival and jerk
Saltfish cakes.

We breathe it

in

like fresh

alr,

and don’t think

to question

the foul smell of

money on our hands;
stilted realities,
fork-tongued politicians,
and generic BET bling bling
beats

ingested with complacency.
We tap our

feet

to this tuneless rhythm
and eat

and sleep.

The enslaved

is not pitiable,

not nearly as pitiable,
as the oblivious slave.
