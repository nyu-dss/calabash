so tuned
they quiver
in sympathetic syncopated time.

Yeah,
Black sure can dance.

Middle Story (blues)

In the stairwell

blackantbodies

run spirals

round white busybodies

with microscopic eyes

neither making head nor tail of
souls sprinting

under science

like we don’t know what we doing
like we don’t know where we going,
like we don’t do nothing but round and round and raound and

Yeah,
Black sure can fly.

Top Story (jazz)
So it goes like this

Her basement blues souls up stairs

Kundalini snaking up the twisting heartache to ejaculate
seeds

exploding from the blackbackbeat of bottombasementbodies
bursting up

and out through one black man on a hot zinc roof

blowing redblackgreen out his

metal mouth

spraying spit libations

to the sky.

don’t think rain.
don’t carry no umbrella...

Yeah
Blacks sure can Blue.
