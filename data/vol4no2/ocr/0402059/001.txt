THE BLACKS AND THE BLUES

Bottom Story (reggae bass line)

It goes like this.
There is the bass, the base, the bass.
There is the basement.

There is a woman

prone

stripped to the bone.

Her fist ball hands

Flay the concrete floor in tune
with her feet.

She is locked inside

her self.

Drowning in give up words
she feels compelled to say
but does not want to hear.

They ricochet,

these dum-dum bullet words,
shattering the one nerve
so tightly strung

inside her

reverberating

harmonic chords

all around

other bodies

so black

they blue
