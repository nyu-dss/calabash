EXILE

Who goes there,
You ask.

I.

With hands glued on

Face sawed off.

Expression painted

So when my ship comes in

I could get

Through the door

Even on borrowed feet

Which should instead

Be wings,

Or a way to cross deep waters.
Done enough of this.

Told myself

To let go

Let go

Let go

The going, then, should be easy now,
But isn’t.

My ill-fitting skin,

Once thick

Now’s too loose

From all the jumping in and out
And living too long under other guises
And too often missing the boat
And forcing myself

To wave

As it sails past.
