Transformation Series, while Earl McKenzie’s muse speaks to him in a Coconut
Alphabet that moves beyond words to find its expression on canvas. And, still, Ralph
Thompson realizes that all art, visual or written, is a transient, fragile and beautiful light
contained within a creative energy that chooses each writer/artist as a medium of
expression.

There in is a moment in the artist statement of Ralph Thompson when he shares
the secret behind the creative impulses of the writer and the artist: an attempt to make
permanent the transience of the world. Thompson is correct because writing, like art, is a
creative act that seeks, as Bishop says, to leave in what is essential to the creation of a
poem or painting, and take out what is not. Through the process of shaping images into
art, or putting words into writing, the three authors/artists listen to images and paint with

Kitts roots. In a personal essay and three poems, Tregenza traces the many middle

wonderful complement to another Kittian writer, Caryl Phillps, who was gracious enough
to share the inner workings of his writing process with the Journal. A prolific writer who
has won numerous awards for his fiction and plays, Caryl Phillips produces work that
interrogates the meaning of grand concepts such as identity, memory, and home.

Finally, all our contributors are people of considerable talents who hear words, or
look at objects, and make it possible for others to see with those words and to hear those
visions. As the words and visions emerge from within the crucible of the experience of
each author/artist, the readers/viewers share in the process, visual and verbal, that makes
artistic creation possible in the first place. As our contributors heed the sights and sounds

of the experiences that shape their art, the Journal looks forward to sharing in the
