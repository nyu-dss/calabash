LITTLE RICHARD’S SECOND COMING

In the Dust Bow] street-lights
Hope rendered us in off-white
Sepia lines of starchy linens sprout
a forest of feathered hats

And, “Jesus-Jesus” hand-fans
Laced and lacy, converts wait
Despite the burning shoes

Across from Hamilton Court

where St. Nicholas snakes like a river

and snips at Seventh Ave at ‘Hund’er’d

N’ Sis-teenth Street: comes Li’] Richard
“Halleujah, Bless His Name!”

‘Lived long enough to see it! -

from Hollywood to Harlem, ‘s-right!

Up the ramped stairs, outside
The platform ‘bout-to-take-your-breath
These women been here, done took-off
from White Women’s Long Island homes
“He Won’t Forsake Us, Nor....”
All around the 25" Precinct, blue sedans wailing
Niggers’ knives cutting every lottery-winner

Crowded like the Hindenberg, the fans rotate
The perfume’s choking like a gas chamber
‘Bout to ask God’s children for their prayers,
- and one tithing-tenth - for the off‘ring
“Sinner! — Saved by Grace!”
Sweet Daddy - Bishop McCullough’s nearby
