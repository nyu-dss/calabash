trombones, blaring: draped in white, the ratings game

But, the Faithful wait for the King of Pommade, Tuti
The Monarch of Mascara, pre-Pink Floyd, Tuti-Fruti
He’s tured his back on Hollywood — protesting!

He’s the King of Rock-and-Roll — will take it back —

“This Little Light of Mine — Say What?”

The tired Daughters of the Carolinas toss their curls
Little Richard’s seen the fork in the road — and took it

Praise his name!
