WALCOTT READS TO BRODSKY’S
GOD-MOTHER

Over on Fifty-Third Street, across from The Modern

an airy building named Donnell, a city-library branch

and friendly sanitarium of plate-glass window inmates

Old city-dreamers, ignored by Monet-watchers,

snooze in safety, avenged from a silver-badge guard

who sits on a stool by a lectern, guarding an elevator-door
You’d need a pass to go upstairs and read the “Foreigns”

“You never quite leave the Soviet Union,” an old man mutters
Besides, the City must protect the very young, the guard says
The toddlers’ reading room — a giant padded cell — is also there
Melted snow, lost pratfalls on the sidewalk claimed by Spring
Pigeons mimic pedestrians’ hurried walk: strut and canter
Street-peddlers selling poster art from Gaughin’s Martinique
perch their wares on subway grids that send up ticker-tape
Walcott arrives surreptitiously, his tweed Welsh coalminer’s hat
pulled down over his Ben Franklins, the signature moustache

A library-aide hurries him to the auditorium, expecting an audience
Instead, the room’s empty; blue wall-paper traces a single person
Walcott shows no surprise, traveling from Brooklyn

He reaches for his poems, curled in a coat-pocket — and begins to read
The lady shifts her weight, and clamps her feet about her bags
Walcott’s caught his breath and leapfrogs to another page

He’s accustomed to this silence, pigeons caught in eaves

Some Simile, once winged, and now fretting for the rhyme
Walcott, litany-voiced, free-verses about sea-grapes

The subway rattles beneath the stage; he stands, looks down

and pauses, and in this rail-screeching minute his audience
grows: two aspiring souls — younger, with more earnest baggage
He’s on to something troubling, something about “half a Nigger”
