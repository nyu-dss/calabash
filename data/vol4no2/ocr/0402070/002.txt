The bag lady fidgets, just as Saint Patrick’s bell-tower tolls
Remembering it is time for evening prayers, fishes for her rosary
She falls asleep again, between Walcott’s chanting of Another Life
Dreaming with her head bowed on her chest, her opening palm
accepts the wafer of his poem about his Brooklyn Aunt

When he finishes, there is no applause; no questions from the seats
The library-aide whispers something kindly, grips his arm, hurrying
past the library’s shrinking liability insurance

Across the street, a distant roar escapes: Ivan the Terrible has fallen
The “RR” local pulls The Modern’s soundtrack into Walcott’s room
Brodsky’s God-mother stirs, a smile wafts over her thawing lips
Walcott’s line trails off: An Inner Life, her Autumn in Norenskaia
