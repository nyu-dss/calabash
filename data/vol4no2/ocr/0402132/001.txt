SEASONS

After a hard winter

Spring wafts in the window

smelling of thawed soil and cut grass.

Thus languor begins,

(J am studying French in a land quartered by seasons)
mope and nope stalling the affairs of men.

Caught up in new metaphors,

I imagine a young girl skipping rope,

levitating at the apogee of jump,

floating off into a Chagall painting.

A conquistador parks his pike in a corner,

mumbling manana and Vivaldi,

after a night’s adventure, knows the score

but will not lift a fist to note a minim or a quaver...later...later.

Born in a pause of hummingbird wings,

cradled under a coconut tree,

I look through this open window

and even in the torpor of this interregnum

I can see in my village the bougainvillea bursting into bloom,
the frank tumescence of anthurium lilies,

the whole seething, teeming, heaving,

jig, jiggle, jerk and jolt of year round germination,
a pregnant girl sashaying confidently by,

a summer in her step, a belly full of hope,

the French language has no single word

for what I mean by home. J’ai le mal du pays!
Lord, how I miss my island.
