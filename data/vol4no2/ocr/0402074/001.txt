LATE NIGHT RHAPSODY

pre-carnival

fete-tripping scene

trying to fit sleep

inside a midnight dream

melody too fast...

tenor-pan sweetness drifting past
my ear to where

my feet just can't stop moving
under my blanket

this can't go on

panorama prelims later today
bass-man dripping sweat

i bet the players are all wet
drenched in nervousness
pan-energy filling my head

sleep running scared

melody tired of re-plays
sounding sweeter as night smokes on
wings & chips for sale
spectators running hunger

as i snack on a bass line
sweetened with a guitar pan’s sugar.
