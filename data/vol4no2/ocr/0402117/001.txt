IN CONVERSATION:
WRITING & PAINTING

I was astonished several months ago when my first collection of poems was
published and over and over again various individuals remarked about the preoccupation

in the collection with the visual arts. I wrote about individual artists ---

... van Gogh and Gaugin must have struggled

in the yellow house at Auvers,

how Vincent always wanted community,

this, before he cut his ear off in desperation when Gaugin moved on:
before the black crows started circling in and over Vincent,

mixing the memories, before the enduring

myth overtook both artists and they started to spin

slowly away from each other and out into the world.

I wrote about individual paintings:

The figure of the young girl is lovely,
And it is almost an exception to the great master’s work!

The studies that have survived
Shows a dying or exhausted mother, a meditative father

And a nude child, his dark hair
Blowing in the wind.

The boat is crowded. Everyone is in rags.
There is not much space --

' Said of Géricault’s painting “a Pareleytic Woman” by his first biographer, Charles Clément.
