together; of trying to make something whole out of pieces; of something old taking on
new life; of one thing becoming another; of making so much beauty out of the scraps of
life. These 5 large quilts of my Great Grandmother’s became The Conversation Series.

By the time I finished working on my Great Grandmother’s quilts I was hooked.
This was at a time when I was looking for a way to pay homage to my Great
Grandmother and to my troubled but beautiful homeland of Jamaica. And what did I
miss more than the flora and fauna of Jamaica---the legendary mountains. Those dark
blue mountains. Those purple-blue mountains. Those emerald green mountains.
Because I am first and foremost a poet, I wanted to pay tribute to the mountains in the
form of poems. Praise poems. Odes. A form that elevates the person, the object, the
occasion.

The celebrated poet Eavan Boland states that odes are “full of flatteries,
exaggerations and claims for the excellence and high standing of the subject....” This is
exactly how I feel and talk about the mountains of my native land. As a child I remember
gazing up and taking strength in the mountains of Jamaica. I remember feeling as though
the mountains would always and always be there. I remember thinking that I could
always turn to the mountains in moments of crisis. Those purple-blue mountains. After
her death my Great Grandmother merged and eventually became one with those
mountains; buried as she is in the district of Nonsuch, surrounded by the dark blue
mountains of Portland. The purple-blue mountains around the district like a protective
womb. The many shades of green mountains. These ode/quilts that I have made are, for
me, a perfect marriage of the visual and written art form.

Several years ago when I had to write a statement about my art I wrote that you
travel, but you take yourself with you. That is what I think I express in my creative
works. My experiences as a Jamaican woman and an exile/immigrant are always at the
center of what I do whether that is my written or visual works that are always in

conversation.
