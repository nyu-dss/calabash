Only a few can survive.
Study after study Géricault makes decisions,

Leaving in what is essential, taking out what
is not, much the same way that I am doing now.

In the final painting, the woman is gone, replaced
by a heroic couplet: a father and a son.

In other poems I wrote about the act of painting and I had somehow merged the
painter and the writer in still other poems. In so many ways I feel that my writing feeds
my visual arts and my visual arts gives me subjects for my writing. For example, there is
a whole section of my first collection of poems devoted to flowers that, “speak in female

’

voices.” Unconsciously, I was also working a series of drawings called, Flower Still
Life: Blue-on-Blue, in which there is an obvious sensuousness to the paintings; an
exploration of femininity; the “givingness” of nature in the form of the flowers.

The shapes, curves, and “organic” forms of the drawings in Flower Sill Life:
Blue-on-Blue makes a statement about female power and beauty; yet at the core of the
work there is something sad, the flowers are drooping, so the drawings are almost a
contradiction. These works then are an exploration of fragility, of the nature of the
“ephemeral” right alongside a meditation on femininity; femaleness, “roundness” and
womanhood. In these drawings I am exploring how flowers are often transplanted and
expected to grow in many and various parts of the world that they are not “native” to. I
am astonished how much these drawings capture so many of the “tropes” of my writing
life.

In fact, what I have come to realize is that there is a deep communication between
my paintings and my writings, that they cross-fertilize each other. In a series of
photographs I did entitled Childhood Memories characters in the photographs are located
in a particular geographical space--either the Caribbean or the USA--while there are

allusions to the other geographical “space”--and here is one of the many poems from my

collection that deals with this very issue:
