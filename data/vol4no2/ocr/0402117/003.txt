You will find them everywhere,

numbered bands on their legs

tracing the route of their migratory flight.

I know a family of Jamaican birds,

the mother bird and four of her five baby birds
are in the United States;

the father has remained in Jamaica.

There is a brother bird in Toronto

along with an aunt bird, and two niece birds.
One of the birds in the family is skittish,

she is forever flying off somewhere,

for a while she lived in Paris

and one night, watching television,

saw birds from her island being interviewed
from their nests in Holland!

Large colonies of Jamaican birds

are dispersed all over the Caribbean,

many went to build the Panama Canal,

and some have even retraced the flight across the Atlantic.
In North America three or four species

have been identified for the peculiar way they sing.

Exile is a major feature of my work as is indicated in a collection of oral histories
I published last year, My Mother Who Is Me: Life Stories from Jamaican Women in New
York. My first novel, The Riverâ€™s Song, looks at some of the reasons why a young
woman would leave the island of Jamaica; while my current writing preoccupations looks
at why someone would return. Exile is also represented in a series of quilts I recently
completed: Odes to the Mountains of Jamaica. These quilts were inspired by a trip to the
island several years ago. A trip that would be the last time I would see my great
grandmother alive. My great grandmother was a great maker of quilts and, after she died
I ended up with these quilts that no one else wanted. Spectacular quilts. Bold in color,
composition and design. A strong indication of who this woman was and what she
thought of and how she lived life; what she thought was beautiful. But here and there
some of the quilts were in need of repair; and one or two of them unfinished: I was only
too happy to complete the quilts that were uncompleted and to repair the ones in need of
repair. In so doing I had a strong sense that, again, I was having a conversation with my
Great Grandmother; trying as best I could to stick to her aesthetic sense, even as I sought

to insist on some of her/our quilts, my own aesthetic sense. I loved the piecing of things
