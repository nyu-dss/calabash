DOCTORBIRD

A resonance of woodland green

and black, he swept past

at shimmering speed and paused
midair

in the winged parenthesis

of what kept him hovering:

his red beak probing the throat

of the ripe banana shoot

in the corner of my father’s garden.

A rush of hummingbird grace,

climbing up and down upon an empty space
too busy to perch, to be pinned to one spot,
he’s the only bird to fly sideways

and backward

like thought,

yet I’ve never heard him sing;

just the cautious humming of his wings
brushing against the breeze.

Scarcely bigger than a thumb,

the leaves stirred in his wake

like a fluttering heart,

proof of how little it takes

to make a child resume playing.
