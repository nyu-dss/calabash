The story, also titled “Graffiti”, was published in the special Commonwealth issue of The
Malhahat Review (Summer 1994),

In the 1980s, after a journey through the Junction Road in Jamaica, I returned to
Mandeville with images of the place very vivid in my mind. It was close to the place
where I was born and raised, and seeing them again, after an absence in Canada, had a
profound influence on me. I began putting the images down on canvas. I took the
painting with me when I moved to teach at the University of the West Indies, Mona.
There I wrote a poem about the painting which I called “Untitled Painting” (The Sunday
Gleaner. January 14, 2007). I completed the painting before the poem appeared in the
newspaper, and titled it “Country View”. I found it interesting that it was bought by a
poet who knew nothing of the poem.

Since then, I have continued the practice of doing paintings with unseen
protagonists, in which the paintings are ways of characterizing them. I think this type of
characterization is very literary, and very similar to what I do in my fiction. I shall
mention two. “The Re-Writer” is about an unseen writer of very modest circumstances,
which we deduce by seeing his notebook and pencil on a tablecloth in the light of a
kitchen-bitch, a kerosene lamp used mainly by the rural poor. “Artefact” is about an
unseen handcart man who writes things on his cart. I have noticed that these paintings
seem to be popular with literary people.

This exercise is mostly about writing and painting, but it is important to add that

these interests also inform my philosophical work, as is evident in the following titles:

“C.L.R. James on Cricket as Art” Caribbean Quarterly Vol. 41,
Nos. 3 & 4, September — December 1995.

“The Cultural Importance of Edna Manley’s Art.” Caribbean
Quarterly. Vol. 52, No. 14, December 2006.

“Spirituality in Contemporary Caribbean Literature.” The
Supplement. 1994/81.

“Philosophy in the West Indian Novel.” (unpublished book).

I think at least two conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing. The first is that,
in my case, writing is mainly a way of completing the artistic process that begins with

painting (although I am _ now thinking, of reversing this process). The second is that
