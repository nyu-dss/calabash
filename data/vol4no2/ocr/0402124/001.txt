A PHILOSOPHER
WHO ALSO WRITES AND PAINTS

As a schoolboy I once climbed a coconut tree at night with a flashlight to see if
the blossoms corresponded with the drawing of them I had just done in my biology exam.
I was gratified that I was not too far off the mark, and slept well that night. I also passed
the exam! Some ten years later, while contemplating a dry coconut I had placed in a still-
life composition, it occurred to me that there was so much I did not know about this
plant. I was seeing so many shapes and patterns I had not observed before. I resolved to
do an artistic study of the plant to learn more about it. To put it in philosophical
terminology: my motivation was part epistemological and part aesthetic.

At the time, I was also reading Hermann Hesse’s book on the life of the Buddha —
he was also a great philosopher — and my painting project soon became a spiritual
exercise,

This was deepened when I found myself writing poems about the coconut plant as
well. I had written poetry and drawn and painted since childhood, but this was the first
time the two had come together. I realize now, for the first time, that philosophy, in a
Buddhist form, was also there, but I was only vaguely aware of the subject then.
Sometimes poems began where paintings ended, and vice versa. Some poems were
versions of paintings. Others were reflections on the painting process. The following

lines from one of the poems is an indication of what was going on:

Then with a brush I tried to find
What with a machete I did not discover
