And soon coconut shapes began to say

Uncoconut things to me
And I found innumerable letters
locked within a coconut alphabet.

The paintings and poems were exhibited together at the Manchester Parish
Library in Mandeville, Jamaica, in 1970. The poems were later condensed into a single
long poem titled “A Coconut Alphabet’, and it is in my first collection of poems,
Against Linearity (Peepal Tree Press, 1992).

One of these paintings, titled “Interior”, was selected for the cover of my second
collection of poems, A Poet’s House (Mango Publishing, 2005). It was the final painting
in the series, and I saw it as a summation of what went before. I introduced this book in
my address at my 2006 art show, and told the audience that many years ago a friend of
mine, an American philosopher, had prophesied that one day my philosophy, writing and
painting would come together in a single praxis. With my painting on the cover of my
often philosophical Book of poems, this I felt, was the nearest I had come to the
fulfillment of his prophecy. In a later newspaper interview, I told the reporter, who
pressed me for a comment on the relation between the three, that I regarded philosophy
as the hub and writing, painting and teaching as spokes that radiated from it. Shortly
after, in the biodata to accompany an article in an edited book, I described myself as a
philosopher who regards writing and painting as ways of philosophizing. My evolution
from being an art teacher, to being an English teacher and then a philosophy teacher, is a
story of self-discovery which led me to philosophy — my intellectual home.

Between “A Coconut Alphabet” and A Poet’s House are two stories: one about a
painting that became a short story, and the other about a painting that became a poem.

As a painter I am interested in Jamaican visual culture, and in the 1970s I did a
painting inspired by my memory of bamboo wattling, a form of building construction
used in rural Jamaica. This painting, which is titled “Graffiti”, portrays the graffiti:
proverbs, song lyrics, exclamations, drawings, etc., - which an unseen protagonist scrawls
on the wall of a building made of bamboo wattling. Many years later, I decided to write

a short story about this character, by constructing a narrative out of the graffiti items.
