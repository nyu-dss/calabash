THE POINCIANA BOUGH

On this side of death
is everything I know.

Like this Poinciana bough,
an outstretched arm
shedding its benediction
of red blossoms

on a parked car.

The irritated motorist
brushes the flowers away,
casting them

to the pollinating wind
and drives out.

There is purpose

even in this

seemingly indiscriminate
squandering of beauty.

Trees, too,
long for immortality.
