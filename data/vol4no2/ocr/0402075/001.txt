IN THE HOUSE OF MEMORY
(April 9, 2005)

Saba...

did we not clean up Saba once
once long ago

claiming

environment

cleaning

where others left

their picnic crumbs

juice boxes, paper, rags?

was the sea then so rough
pitching and tossing

not this same boat

MacLean I

(those days McLean still lived
and rode his motor-bike
fearless and helmetted

up slopes he thought he owned
grandson of Drake, godson of Hawkins
seeking other gold

and other goals

textbooks and science labs)?

No change in seascape
undulating mountains
part to islands still
sailboats and small skiffs

glide along the blue
