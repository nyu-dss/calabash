smooth now

and almost ripple free
like clean sheets on
Saturday eveningâ€™s bed

we ride at anchor

gazing out to sea

or swim and snorkel

near the boat

(one seasick lassie cant enjoy this gig)

this older woman

watch her

walking she takes a cane

but in the water puts her goggles on
kicks out into the ten or fifteen feet
and makes it look like home

The birds will come

the tour-guide pilot says
laughing-gulls and terns

and tropic birds

to hang out here till mid-December
( when the tourists come?)

one solo frigate bird

efficient glider

( did he inspire the metal frigate flying further yonder?)
wings in and out our view

so high

so very high

the guide reports one angel fish
big fish and beautiful

and sea-turtles

staying here

more here than anywhere...

What do you want to do?
what else?

the rest must stay
another time

another ride

someone is very sick
and needs the shore.
