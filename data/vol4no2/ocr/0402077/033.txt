reformulate tradition. I imagine that he is pressed to make this move because, having criticized
the aesthetic of recrimination, he must now evade the bayonet that would immobilize him as a
conservative, or neo-colonialist, wishing to retain the pre-Independence status quo of
anglophilia—that is to say, to preserve the hegemony and privilege of the (white) literary

tradition into which he has been welcomed. He writes:

I do not know if one poet is indebted to the other, but whatever the bibliographical truth
is, one acknowledges not an exchange of influences, but the tidal advance of the
metropolitan language, of its empire, if you like, which carries simultaneously, fed by
such strong colonial tributaries, poets of such different beliefs as Rimbaud, Char,
Claudel, Perse, and Césaire. It is the language which is the empire, and great poets are not
its vassals but its princes. We continue to categorize these poets by the wrong process,

that is, by history. (50-51)

Notice the misleading and defiant gesture in the throw-away phrase, “of its empire, if you like.”
The phrase is defiant in that it implies: I’m not afraid to identify poetry with the expansion of an
empire. The phrase misleads by appearing to concede a point. Though I would not have put it so
myself, I can still accept your word “empire.” You'll say that I meant empire in any case. But
then, having disowned the word, or owned up to it in order to defy his adversaries, Walcott goes
on to elaborate upon the metaphor, and in the end it becomes integral to his critical description of
the relationship between poet and language, poetry and power. The great poet, whatever his race,
feeds the ocean of metropolitan language in its tidal advance. This language flows as an
empire—it is “the empire,” he declares.

As if in dialogue with the essay, the poem “North and South” takes up this topic of
empire again. But here, the “colonial upstart” spells out a distinction between empire and
language on moral grounds. Empires, in their “presumption,” bring death into the world: the
Roman annihilation of Carthage, or later in the poem, the Nazi Reich’s extermination of the
Jews. Therefore, he says, “It’s good that everything’s gone, except their language, / which is
everything” (405). The poem re-states the position that the English language is what matters, but
without saying that “language, which is everything” “is the empire.”

The governor, police inspector, schoolmaster—they have returned home. Now is the

time, presumably, to displace the colonial ideology—that is, to dismantle the hierarchy of master

and slave, and to reject the cultivation of mimicry—and also to rethink the social function of the
