My mother and I spoke recently about this attachment. She recalled that her teachers had
been from England, that they were English nuns; the pupils knew and daily sang “Rule
Britannia” and “God Save the King”; they read, exclusively, books by English writers, studied
Latin—“the lovely Latin lost to all our schools,” Walcott calls it (‘Hotel Normandie,” 442).
They learnt English history, in detail, starting from 1066. My mother was raised to be English: to
speak English properly, to have the social manners and tastes of the English: empire bounded the
horizon of her identity. My mother, my aunts, they love the English—all things English. It would
be churlish to accuse such a love, formed in their early schooldays, as being a mistaken location
of their proper (postcolonial) identities. A false consciousness of their social position. A
misplaced allegiance to masters. Theirs is not an ignorant love. They know that their education,
the promise of being English, belongs to another time, almost to another life. They understand
the crime that was the English plantation system in the West Indies. They know all about deadly
color prejudice, much more than I do since they suffered under it—the contempt of colonial
officials, the insults from the nuns at school, the belief that figures of authority (church ministers,
for example) should not be “too black.” None of it makes a difference because the radiance of
England shines from childhood memory, ready to become active at the taste of a madeleine.

What should have been obvious to me is that you cannot endure an educational program
designed to raise subjects of the empire and to possess your allegiance so long as the empire
shall last, and remain indifferent, in the alert text of your affections, to England and the English
people. “I still have a subliminal fear of Europe,” Walcott says in 1977. Some colonials, like
Michael Ondaatje’s character Kip in The English Patient, must even experience England as a
kind of erotic grasp, and the struggle that follows upon disillusionment must be violent indeed.
What Walcott’s generation called “mimicry,” so much discussed in the 1960s, one might
characterize as the result of a seduction that accompanies the press of power and that makes it

tolerable for a while.

VI.
Put in this way—that empire garrisons the borders of identity—I can read with new eyes an
extraordinarily dramatic passage from the essay “The Muse of History,” first published in 1974. I
would like to close by drawing your attention to it. Out of the polemic against the obsession with

manacles and with black power motifs, suddenly Walcott pivots and grapples with a way to
