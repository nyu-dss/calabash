Africa, Europe, and the ground one stands on, the page where hieroglyphs are written or are
erased. This triplex pattern repeats across the archipelago (supplemented by arrivals from other
continents), occurs in St. Lucia, Cuba, Haiti, Trinidad, Martinique, and Jamaica, and can be
stated briefly as the three origins or sources of culture and sensibility.

The indigenous is a complex of elementary vectors, some from overseas. The language
that the colonial masters, the planters, overseers, and tavern keepers, brought with them to the
West Indies goes through a process of change—creolization—under pressure from the West
African languages brought by the kidnapped labor. The slave masks his speech; he adopts the
camouflage of noise to thwart surveillance. To Edouard Glissant, student of Caribbean discourse,
the archipelago presents “most vividly” an image of the concept of “Relation.” In fact, as a
rendezvous prepared from the “linked histories of peoples,” creolization “approximates” the
poetics of Relation: “It is not merely an encounter, a shock... , a métissage, but a new and
original dimension allowing each person to be there and elsewhere, rooted and open, lost in the
mountains and free beneath the sea, in harmony and errantry” (33-34).’ Active in the mouth of
disunity, Creolization spans and harmonizes the archipelago. Walcott probes the spidery

depths—rooted and open, free and oceanic—of this creole formation. Of the Spanish settlers:

Being men, they could not live
except they first presumed

the right of every thing to be a noun.
The African acquiesced,

repeated, and changed them. (307)

Compressing centuries into a moment, the poem sums up a bitter and murderous history. “The
African acquiesced, / repeated, and changed” the European words—creolized the language and

thereby made the West Indies. That process continues, transmitted from generation to generation:

and children, look at these stars
over Valencia’s forest!

Not Orion,

not Betelgeuse,

tell me, what do they look like?
Answer, you damned little Arabs!
