The colonial encounter above all, however, lies at the origin of the modern West Indies,
and furnishes material for a founding myth. Resident from Guyana to Jamaica at the time of
Columbus’s voyages, the Amerindians left behind no written records. Where one might expect to
discover their stories, only “Blank pages turn in the wind” according to the poem “Origins” (11),
the title of which signals a thematic pre-occupation that continues through poems such as
“Crusoe’s Island,” “Crusoe’s Journal,’ “Names,” “The Schooner Flight,’ and Omeros. If the
West Indies does have a founding literary document, it is written not by an indigene or an
African, but by a metropolitan Englishman. Starting from this observation, the West Indian poet
builds into that story a point of view that represents the others of the encounter. In 1965, The
Castaway and Other Poems appears in print. This volume contains two poems anointing
Robinson Crusoe as the archetype of West Indian man, and Defoe’s novel as the creation story
and originary “timbers” later writers will build upon: “our first book, our profane Genesis” (92).
The poet’s relationship to Crusoe’s journals is one of intimacy. From their daily use—so one

might daily read the Bible—he learns how to make a new language:

So from this house
that faces nothing but the sea, his journals
assume a household use;
we learn to shape from them, where nothing was
the language of a race. (94)

In an older usage, “race” means a collection of people living over an extended span of time in the
same place. Crusoe’s journals furnish the means for the creation of a language for the West
Indian “race,” in this older sense. Was there no language before this? Were we dumb before
English settlers—missionary or castaway—taught us to speak? In the dream of colonial
discourse, the answer to these questions is well known: No, there was not; and, Yes, you were.
Indeed, Walcott’s poem not only confirms the debt owed to the English document but also
construes an attitude of intimacy towards this material. The journals are a cherished household
object, a familiar and daily companion. The poet admits into his inner circle a book that is
nothing if not a fantasy of imperial conquest. The Amerindian whom Crusoe rescues, it will be
recalled, right away prostrates himself and places his head beneath Crusoe’s foot; he has no

name we know of except the one Crusoe bestows upon him; and among the first English words
