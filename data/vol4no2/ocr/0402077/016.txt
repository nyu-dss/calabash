Samora Machel, fresh from the wars in Mozambique, visited Jamaica wearing battle fatigues,
and I went to hear him speak. Mozambique! In those years of the 1970s, Africa, not Europe,
Cuba not the United States, provided models for building the nation. The government, some say
despotism, of Grenada fell to socialists in 1979.

Among other critiques, Walcott reacted strongly to two aspects of this upheaval in
cultural identity: first, to what he denounced in a 1974 essay as the “literature of recrimination
and despair, a literature of revenge written by the descendants of slaves” (“Muse” 37); and
second, to a tutorial impulse seeking to rehabilitate the image of blackness—the slogan “black is
beautiful” can stand here for that project—grounding West Indian identity in blackness, and
blackness in turn in Africanity. Effectively, culture in the West Indies was to be grasped as

black, which meant that the complexities of the multi-ethnic societies in the region would be

elided.

Taking these points in reverse order, one can understand Walcott’s objections to the
discourse of blackness as a reaction against—and a refusal of—any reification of identity,
instead of as a denial of the predominant African share in West Indian origins. The poem
“Names” (1976) gestures towards this position. Myth locates racial origins in the cry of a terrible

vowel, in the sound of the first person singular.

A sea-eagle screams from the rock,
and my race began like the osprey

with that cry,
that terrible vowel,
that I!

The race begins with an act of individuation, in a vowel sound that echoes the final phoneme of
the osprey’s cry. Having signaled its beginnings, the race of myth is content to abandon the usual

preoccupations with identity associated with naming:

Behind us all the sky folded,
as history folds over a fishline,
and the foam foreclosed

with nothing in our hands

but this stick
to trace our names on the sand
