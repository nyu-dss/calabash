every neglected, self-pitying inlet
muttering in brackish dialect. . .

The self-pitying inlet mutters in “brackish dialect” (=Creole). The natural world appears to the
eye, which is sensitive to color, as a type of fugitive communication: the “ochre track” loses

itself in “‘an unfinished phrase.”

each ochre track seeking some hilltop and
losing itself in an unfinished phrase,

under sand shipyards where the burn-out palms
inverted the design of unrigged schooners,
entering forests, boiling with life,

goyave, corrosol, bois-canot, sapotille.

The forest teems with personal life. The reciprocity of call and response—dynamic, synthetic,
mutually reliant, spontaneous yet ceremonial—joins speech to a place, environment to speech, in
an oral poetics. The onset of words in italics indicates a change in focal point. Not the trees, but
rather the Creole words that name them, move into the foreground of awareness. If signs imitate
objects, then taxonomy articulates names as “content,” in Saussure’s thesis, and not only as a
table of differences. Goyave, corrosol, bois-canot, sapotille—these words at the conclusion of a
passage threaded with utterance appear, audibly, to emerge from the forest itself.

Towards the end of the linguistic spectrum where Creole is replaced by forms of
metropolitan speech, the situation of trees and men is rather bleak. The shift in linguistic register
corresponds to a movement from organicism to artifice. Colonial policy attempted what Eliot
deplored, when he said of the British in India: “No man is good enough to have the right to make
another over in his own image. The benefits of British rule will soon be lost, but the ill-effects of
the disturbance of a native culture by an alien one will remain” (139).* Not a name-giver, in the
colonial system of knowledge, the African is given a name; a laborer once more, he pursues a
goal—Eliot’s “image”; Walcott’s “what their given sounds resembled’”—established by others.

The language of geometry would say that trees and men approach the resemblance contained in

STs. Eliot, Christianity and Culture (San Diego, et al.: Harcourt Brace, 1968).
