Reflection upon the idea, creation, and collapse of the West Indies Federation confers the weight
of historical fact upon the poem’s undated contention: that the territory of the archipelago has
been “divided among the tribes” into fragments. An episode that took place within living
memory anchors this judgment. But the conditions under diagnosis pertain to an older history:
the stanzas suggest that disunity is intrinsic to the region. The foreground shifts from location to

’

location; the reader’s attention is summoned by the adverb “here,” only to be focused more

closely upon “leaves” and “edible roots,” which shift their morphology to “pages” containing a

’

“lesson,” and finally reveal an image of “Africa,” in the shape of a heart. The lines enact a
radical discontinuity in thought.

Co-ordinate with the main clause of the first stanza—given equivalent weight to it—the
second stanza changes the object of viewing once more. Hieroglyphs displace the image of
Africa. But a dislocation also takes place in time. This section of the poem narrates the young
poet’s quest to learn the details of St. Lucia’s countryside. The verb “was” of the first line (“here
was a life older than geography’) therefore refers to an encounter within the poet’s lifetime. But
in the succeeding stanza, the time-frame being cited is more ambiguous, seeming to encompass
the primordial and continuous past of an epoch that flourished long before the poet arrived to
view its signs. And yet the poet takes note of falling rain in the same verbal tense that he uses to
record the vegetation. In other words, the syntax of simultaneity conjoins disparate times and
places. An observation on nearby plant life (“here was”) gives way to a scenario of reading
simultaneous with it (“as the leaves .. . opened”), which through the coordinate conjunction and
verb tense (“and ... were razed”), gives way to a simultaneous erasure of ancient hieroglyphs,
and ones that in any case, paradoxically, had already been “lost.” The “broken root” of the
archipelago floats unmoored in time and space away from these events, in the syntax of mere
apposition, as if the archipelago were itself an event and not the site where events occur.

Nevertheless, one fact of history, or fact of power, that allows me to call the West Indies
a place is to be found in the child’s last lesson. Rain erases the hieroglyphs of the first dwellers
of the islands even as the book opens and reveals its lesson. The book has an image on its pages,
Africa in the shape of a heart. The edible roots belong to the natural surroundings. They
comprise a book. But this book, as a book, as a cultural object, cannot be indigenous. Books

come from the colonial library. The book is edible, a root that grows in the soil, but as a book,

the root teaches a lesson: that one has to coordinate three origins for the West Indies, as it were,
