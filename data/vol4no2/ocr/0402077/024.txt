volleys of blue-wing teal and mallard fly
from longbows of reeds bent by the wind,
arrows of yearning for our different sky.

The winter scene is then transposed to the mind. The migrating birds re-appear as a metaphor for
poetic images; and the arrows are abstracted into the violence with which these images break

into consciousness:

awoke this sunrise to a violence
of images migrating from the mind. (77)

Images are violent because they migrate from the mind without the poet’s intervention: they
overcome, or bypass, his will. Walcott’s metaphors are violent in another sense. They conjoin in
identity disparate objects that have almost no common attributes, except as bestowed by the
metaphor: “a plane smoothing down a piece of wood” and “speech”; things that occur at widely
disparate rates of speed: “intensifying cold in wintertime” and “gripping and firing a longbow”;
and things of vastly different sizes, “archipelago” and “root.”

Taking a wider view, one could say that the phrase “ciseau la mer,” as a metaphor,
emblematizes a metaphoric process in Walcott’s poetry that aims to conjoin in identity not only
disparate objects of perception such as “cigarette” and “trigger,” or “sea” and “book,” but to
conjoin disparate places, different parts of the world. In the phrase “ciseau la mer,” Europe and
Africa meet in St. Lucia. From this perspective, painting would limit Walcott’s reach—you paint
what’s in front of you—whereas metaphor expands the horizons of perception beyond the
immediate physical spaces available to the senses. Ironically, it was his failure—or so he puts
it—as a painter that revealed more patently his aptitude and appetite for metaphor. This aptitude

does not translate over to painting:

Where did I fail? I could draw,

I was disciplined, humble, I rendered
the visible world that I saw

exactly, yet it hindered me...

... 1 lived in a different gift,

its element metaphor

while Gregorias would draw
