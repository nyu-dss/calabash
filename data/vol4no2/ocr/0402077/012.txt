Sir, fireflies caught in molasses. (308)

Starting from particulars, combining them into new patterns, one gives names to other objects of
the visible world. Perception goes on record as a metaphor available only to a native of the place.
Lacking fireflies, or lacking molasses, the name-giver from a different milieu turns to his local
particulars—the armor, sheath, and sword of a warrior; a bull with pointed horns; a maid
carrying water—to map his vision of the heavens.

Dramatically and memorably according to Walcott, creole speech maps earthly
surroundings through a process that is inherently metaphoric. As in Plato’s Cratylus, the name in
creole resembles the essential being of the thing to be named. Put in terms of the Saussurean
structure of the linguistic sign, the bond between signifier and signified, or word and referent, is
not arbitrary but motivated through mimesis. Walcott comments:

The metaphors that one hears from peasants describing a tree, a flower, an insect,
anything, were not like the Latin names for those things. .. . Let’s say you’re looking up
at a bird in the sky over St. Lucia and someone says ‘ciseau la mer.’ Now ‘ciseau la mer’
means ‘scissor of the sea,’ and that’s much more startling, much more exciting than
saying ‘martin’ or ‘tern.’ The metaphor is almost calligraphic: when it is pronounced you
can almost see it. (Edward Hirsch interview, 1977; 58)

Bird and name-of-bird are joined in a synaesthesia where “ciseau la mer,” the bird that flies
above the sea, looks like the sound of its name. Set next to metropolitan language, Creole seems
to fail as speech: it neglects rules of syntax and pronunciation. Poor and uneducated, Creole
speakers mangle language. Set within a theatre of the environment, especially the natural world,
Creole intimately connects names and things. The name does not fix a label to the thing so much
as recall, or call out again, its visual presence.

Names emerge organically from verbalized perception. Walcott represents this organic
emergence as a vocal echo, as if the natural world could speak. The countryside of Another Life
teems with utterance. Crisscrossing St. Lucia, the young poet adopts the brief of conqueror and
botanist, intent on laying claim to the island as home and on recording its geography and natural

history. “[W]e swore,” he writes,

that we would never leave the island
until we had put down, in paint, in words,
as palmists learn the network of a hand,
all of its sunken, leaf-choked ravines,
