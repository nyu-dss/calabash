Now in that trivial ambiguous word “supposed”—“politically and culturally the British heritage
was supposed to be mine’”—I fancy to myself that I hear a note of disillusion. It was supposed to
be mine but things turned out quite the other way. It was not mine. Or, it was mine but in a

disturbing, complicated way. Early on in Another Life, we find a startling self-portrait:

The dream
of reason had produced its monster:
a prodigy of the wrong age and colour. (145)

The good library on the small island holds the heritage, the dream of reason: Europe’s dream,
Prospero’s dream, out of the dark backward and abysm of time, gone awry in the enslavement of
Caliban; Victor Frankenstein’s dream of reason fulfilled in the rage of his monster assembled
from corpses. In being a dream, in being able to dream itself, doesn’t reason already contain the
seed of its opposite: irrationality, monstrosity? The logic of the dream, of the library, plays out in
St. Lucia as an error: a prodigy—in the Latin, another name would be monstrum—of the wrong
age and color. Not the age of Enlightenment, and not the color of the men of the Enlightenment.
This error is not one that West Indians of my generation had the privilege of being victimized by.
Not having grown up inside the colonial embrace, we did not suppose that the British heritage
was ever ours—and more, insofar as we were concerned with things like heritage, it was the
heritage of resistance, struggle, revolt, the themes of so many popular reggae songs, that we
thought about: the heritage of black people.

Three points of reference: The poet Claude McKay, an anti-imperial communist, a
speaker at the Fourth Congress of the Comintern held in Moscow in 1922, once wrote in his
dialect verse that he had a longing in his heart “to view de homeland England.” I have already
mentioned James’s affirmation: “I was British.” A signal partisan of West Indian nationalism,
James makes this observation without qualification or irony. The Guyanese novelist George
Lamming notes that West Indians, in the period after World War I, would think of going to
England as going to the Mother Country. I find such statements alarming, completely baffling.
They speak of a lost world—and not a world recorded in academic criticism and critical theory—
a psychic world of individuals educated in a certain way, tutored through a host of messages—
traditions—to think of England as a motherland, as a “homeland” from which they have been

separated as from a cherished locale of their childhoods.
