say that West Indian poetry springs from anti-colonial disobedience. The bastard transgresses the
Law; the slave violates the sanctified border between the master and himself.

Noticing the adjective “Victorian,” however, one might turn to ask about the temporal
relationship between the library written by Walcott and the library of heirloom books from the
days of empire. Born in 1930, about three decades after the death of Victoria Regina—but let me
first quote another passage from “North and South” to fix in your mind the curious mixture of a

lingering imperial past joined to a bustling West Indian present. Like the word “dialect,” “patois”

gives another name for creole speech:

How far I am from those cacophonous seaports
built round the single exclamation of one statue
of Victoria Regina! There vultures shift on the roof

of the red iron market, whose patois

Where quiet reigns in the mansion and in the library, cacophony reigns at the seaport, and in the
midst of this noise, built perhaps on a pedestal within a round-a-bout, stands the statue of Queen
Victoria.

Existence as colonies of England had the effect of slowing down time in the West Indies.
Still in the 1960s, with each visit from a member of the royal family, on a tour of England’s
(former) dominions and territories, the pageantry of empire would revive and a lineage dating
within living memory back to the Victorian era would become conspicuous. I remember this.
The Governor General embodied this imperial lineage. An imposing spectacle, wearing a
princely uniform, bemedalled, sashed, and hatted, this Jamaican was essential to the ceremonial
parade of national affairs. Appointed by the queen to be her royal envoy (he was, in actuality, the
choice of the Jamaican government), the Governor General received the knighthood, and though
lacking in executive power was the one who on the radio formally declared Parliament in session
and delivered the “Throne Speech” each year. Photographs showed him receiving the newly-
elected prime minister, foreign envoys, and visiting heads of state at Vale Royal, his residential
manor fronted by white columns and acres of a manicured lawn. All cabinet ministers were
formally appointed by him. I remember this. The reach of imperial influence, confirmed in the

names of the streets, was not an abstraction. The monarchy was written onto the spaces of the
