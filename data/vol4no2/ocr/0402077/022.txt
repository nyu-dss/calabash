at the presumption of empires to hear the worm

gnawing their solemn columns into coral,

to snorkel over Atlantis, to see, through a mask,

Sidon up to its windows in sand, Tyre, Alexandria,

with their wavering seaweed spires through a glass-bottom boat,
and to but porous fragments of the Parthenon

from a fisherman in Tobago, but the fear exists,

Delenda est Carthago on the rose horizon . . . (405)

The imagination distorts and alchemizes world-historical cities so that they draw near to our
everyday experience in their ruin: the fisherman finds a fragment of Periclean Athens caught up
in his fishing net.

Later, the location of speech swerves abruptly from New York in winter (“this heart of
darkness’’) to the West Indies. The reader witnesses a scene, and a way of life, that I felt would

be recognizable to any West Indian:

I am thinking of an exile farther than any country.
And in this heart of darkness, I cannot believe
they are now talking over palings by the doddering
banana fences, or that seas can be warm. (406)

Memory displaces the present fact: people talk over palings with the warm sea nearby. Some
writers need only a line or two to sketch a way of life. It is an inimitable talent, flowering from
an aptitude for parsing the mesh of a culture. Attention can be trained, and language ability can
be cultivated, both up to a point. But how can you train someone to adjust words to stored
perceptions, to write down the verbal form of a visual and intellectual event? In these three lines,
I hear a voice whose accents infiltrate and coalesce in the collision of bumpy sounds, “doddering
banana fences,” and I see a way of life, both at a single moment and as it persists through time,
remote as it is from the poet’s own upstart cosmopolitanism.

These lines shocked me. They still shock me. That one should put “banana” into a poem
that meditates upon the “guttural death rattle of empires”—that is to mix the very high with the
very humble. Personal mobility, cheap modes of communication, mean that the world out there
is not so remote. (Even more so today: in coastal Jamaica, fishermen carry as many as three
cellphones when they go out to sea.) Empire has always had the means of building far-flung

networks to project power. With the nuclear bomb, however, everyone is implicated, and all at
