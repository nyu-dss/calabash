not only because that which is forgotten cannot be written as history, but because his own poetry
refutes this thesis, contains much that did not surrender to amnesia—everything that makes

creole culture vital. Indeed, forgetting is integral to generation. As Glissant says:

the Creole language has [an] internal obligation: to renew itself in every instance on the
basis of a series of forgettings. Forgetting, that is, integration, of what it starts from: the
multiplicity of African languages on the one hand and European ones on the other; the
nostalgia, finally, for the Caribbean remains of these. (69)

The women talking over palings by the doddering banana fences are replete with memory. Or, as
Walcott says of the forest, filled with a life “older than geography,” that is, older than the charts

of colonial territories prepared in London and summarized in the geography textbooks of the

New World.

IV.
As you can probably tell by now, I’ve been reading Walcott backwards, from The Fortunate
Traveller, to The Star-Apple Kingdom, Sea Grapes, Another Life, The Gulf, The Castaway, and
so on. If one adds to these the books published since 1981, Midsummer, The Arkansas
Testament, Omeros, The Odyssey, Tiepolo’s Hound, The Prodigal, and the collections of plays,
interviews, and essays, then Walcott’s oeuvre might be said to comprise a small library. Reading
the English library, he has written a West Indian library. Libraries run in the family. His father
owned a “small blue library / of reproductions” from the old masters that he studied assiduously
(202). The library dwells at the center of the house and the youth has free access to it. But
elsewhere, on other pages of the autobiography, it’s not so simple. Signs posted in the house of

literature say: do not touch:

I had entered the house of literature as a houseboy,
filched as the slum child stole,

as the young slave appropriated

those heirlooms temptingly left

with the Victorian homilies of Noli tangere. (219)

The house of literature barred to the slum-child, the heirlooms appropriated by the slave, who

ignores the Latin injunction Noli tangere—these make for attractive metaphors, politically. They
