their given sounds in the way that the curve of a graph approaches a limit asymptotically, getting

ever closer but never quite meeting up with it:

the archipelago like a broken root,
divided among the tribes, while trees and men
laboured assiduously, silently to become

whatever their given sounds resembled,
ironwood, logwood-heart, golden apples, cedars,
and were nearly

ironwood, logwood-heart, golden apples, cedars,
men... [sic].“ (196)

History throws a canopy of verisimilitude over these lines: the promise of unity through
Federation collapses into national factions. This is a dateable event. The remainder of the
passage acquires historical reality by association with the initial figure of division. And so a
reader says: in the history of the West Indies, trees and men perform such futile labor. Since not
yet logwood-heart, they labor to become logwood-heart. Since not yet, or not quite, men, they
labor to become men. Their silence attests to effort and sincerity. Until the artifice of labor gives
place to the organicism of identity, they remain without voice—dumb, struggling, unappeased,
insufficient, and trapped: simulacra. Colonialism presents colonized man with a terrible shadow.
In pursuit of the shadow, the West Indian is never self-same; in turning to face the given name,
he turns from the environment, and from organic reciprocity, towards artifice and mimicry.
Imposed as an external policy, the desire to make over the self turns inward. This is the point to
emphasize. West Indians—the middle class, the intellectuals—were complicit in their alienation.
They succumbed to the allure of English.

No doubt this is how it was. But after reading Fanon, one wishes for a different account
of history—one wishes for the story of anti-colonial resistance. That West Indians chased after
an English idea of what, or who, they ought to resemble—this offends progressive thought. A
West Indian intellectual of the 1960s and 1970s who had digested C.L.R. James’s history of the
Haitian revolution should not so calmly agree that men willfully adopted a colonial standard of
self-definition. Walcott, however, repeats himself. “The African,’ he writes elsewhere,

“acquiesced, / repeated, and changed” the European words. You can see from this passage why
