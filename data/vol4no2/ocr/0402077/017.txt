which the sea erased again, to our indifference.” (306)

Writing the name takes place idly, an ordinary act of self-definition, but the imprint is ephemeral,
and the sea erases it. The cycle of naming and oblivion follows the rhythms of the tides; upon the
palimpsest of the sand, no name escapes erosion, but the writer accepts this loss with
indifference. Erasure marks a return of self to elementary rhythms, without alphabet or race.

To denounce the literature of revenge is not to be ignorant of the horrors of the slave
trade, and to idealize nonchalance towards identity is not to sanitize the past. Walcott holds
intricately phrased, ambiguous views on the place of Africa in West Indian origins. Where the
historian, seduced by the muse of fact into telling of crimes, fails to hear into the past, the “child
without history” transcends the rupture of the middle passage and hears far more. The child is

superior to the adult scholar:

that child who puts the shell’s howl to his ear,

hears nothing, hears everything

that the historian cannot hear, the howls

of all the races that crossed the water

the howl of grandfathers drowned

in that intricately swivelled Babel,

hears the fellaheen, the Madrasi, the Mandingo, the Ashanti,
yes, and hears also the echoing green fissures of Canton,
and thousands without longing for this other shore

by the mud tablets of the Indian provinces .. . (285)

The crimes of the past ought not to shackle the imagination. Indeed, the effort of the West Indian
poet to “say who he is,” a move to utterance that “takes a long time,” solicits myth rather than
history, and is an encounter with natural powers, an environment teeming with signs (Interview
52). The child’s mythopoeic, catholic imagination re-materializes the distinct sounds of “all the
races that crossed the water”: races from West Africa, India, and China. Writing the names of the
nations mourns their losses and pays homage to them. The child does not neglect the plural
ethnic and continental reach of the descendants that people the region. Spelled out in the Antilles,

his Nobel lecture, Walcott’s West Indies is multiply sourced and scored.

” This indifference to erasure had long puzzled me. When Walcott visited Georgetown in the spring of
2005, he was asked about the poem by a student. My reading here is indebted to Walcott’s response.
