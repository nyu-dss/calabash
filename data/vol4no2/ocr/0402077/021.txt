To call your contemporaries lepers and monkeys, men who chafe as they narcissistically display
their sores from manacles—well, that’s rather provocative. My generation was too young to stray
into the error of neo-colonialism. That quarrel belongs to someone else’s past. The difference in
generational attitudes towards the colonial period is quite marked, marks as it were a shift in

sensibility in progress during those years, and I will return to it later in this essay.

TIL.

When, in 1981, a friend gave me the first hardcover edition of Walcott’s The Fortunate
Traveller, | knew nothing of his earlier work; the controversy had not come to my notice; and
Créolité was something I lived without needing to analyze. The linguists, anthropologists, and
historians had written books about the West Indies that I had not read, and I did not need these
texts to read Walcott. The fortunate poet travels outside the West Indies, to New York where I
was then living, to a store in Virginia where he collects change from the cashier. The poems have
the strong flavor of New England, the milieu of Melville and Robert Lowell which I had read
about and visited, suggestions of the Aegean islands that I, too, romanticized from Greek poetry.
The poet, as a “colonial upstart,” as “a single, circling, homeless satellite,” roams about the north
and the south. Small details summon up whole cities and even epochs: “Beetle-back taxi from
Heathrow to my flat,” evoking the streets of cosmopolitan London (458); or “the fountains trot
like percherons round the Met, / clip, clop, clip, clop in Belle Epoque Manhattan,” recreating an
image from the Gilded Age (403). The trajectory of Walcott’s generation out of the West Indies
and into the metropolitan centers of the North is evident in the collection.

The poem “North and South” anchors the book for me. Here, the mind operates on the
large scale and the small. The upstart at the end of an empire re-situates the empires of the past in
their ruin and superimposes one empire upon the place of another. Carthage, which was
destroyed by Rome, the British empire in its death-throes, Tyre and Sidon, cities conquered by
Alexander, and Alexandria itself named for the Macedonian appear in procession as if through “a
glass-bottom boat,” the pane of glass in the bottom of a fishing boat acting as a sort of trans-

historical television screen.

And it may be a childish revenge
