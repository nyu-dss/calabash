Thus written into the canon, Walcott’s poetry never feels quite at ease with the spoken
language. A reader’s knowledge of English poetry invests his work with literary echoes. The
abrupt entry of the extinct mastodon, and arctic glaciers, into “The Flock,” published in 1965,
ostensibly builds to a metaphor for remote, unrepeatable achievements. Of a piece with the local
winter landscape, the “Arctic” once “froze giant minds,” the poem says. Not “glaciers of Arctic
ideas,” or “Arctic thoughts’—or another metaphor that could shift the Arctic into a figurative

condition—but, simply:

The dark impartial Arctic,
whose glaciers encased the mastodon,
froze giant minds in marble attitudes. (78)

I have long felt that an explanation of these lines was called for. The poem roots the Arctic in the
frame of observable, and documented, discovery. The word “impartial” touches the statement
with the slightest of anthropomorphism, but not enough to initiate allegory in advance of the
predicate, “froze giant minds.” In between the first and third lines we unaccountably learn about
the mastodon. Surely the giant minds cannot have roamed the icy terrain as the mastodon once
did, nor has the terrain been displaced from the frame of observable geography and acquired the
attributes of a figure. Something is missing, a context for the statement, that would explain how
one and the same Arctic can be said to act upon a prehistoric creature and on monumental works
of thought. Discovering a source for a poem’s images has the effect of calming the mind. The
poem remains unchanged—no words are added, or taken away. But being able to point to an
origin satisfies the wish to understand. Readers of a certain age and background, more
acquainted with Victorian verse than we in America are, I like to imagine, would have realized

that Tennyson’s “The Epic” is Walcott’s intertext:

Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,

And the green freedom of a cockatoo

Upon a rug, mingle to dissipate

The holy hush of ancient sacrifice. (my italics; 66-67)

Gesturing towards Marvell, the poem debates the adequacy of paradise in heaven and on earth. The
sensuous, utopian island of “Bermudas” was created presumably by God; the earthly paradise of “Sunday
Morning” is finally “our perishing own,” decked out in “our colors,” and unperfected by the hand of a
deity.
