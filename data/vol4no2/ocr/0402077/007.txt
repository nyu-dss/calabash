Why take the style of those heroic times?
For nature brings not back the mastodon,
Nor we those times; and why should any man

Remodel models? (81-82)”

Calling Walcott’s early poetry from Jn a Green Night a remodeling of models is not unfair. We
have seen how he takes over from the canon structures of thought and vocabulary to overwrite
the West Indian environment with a literary—English—sensibility. What happens around the
mastodon in “The Flock” is something else, more heedless of the model, more willful. He will
not tolerate the model’s primacy and all but abolishes its traces. He dismembers Tennyson’s
verse. Nevertheless, he makes it present, as if in some small way to pay his respects to the earlier
poet.

As time passes, Walcott acquires a signature—Jameson’s word for the conspicuous,
unprecedented, individual styles of high modernist literature. He devises a syntax and a store of
tropes—especially metaphors that link nature and text—for his distinctive way of seeing things.
If one hears Little Gidding in the master’s soliloquy of “The Hotel Normandie Pool,” this does
not fix Walcott at the margins of his text. Now this way of seeing and saying, resonant with the
major idioms of British and American poetry, has the strange surprising quality of being familiar
to me. Much turns on how one explains this familiarity. I mean, not that his poetry expresses a
West Indian essence, or a national character. Say rather that he paints a scene with words,
swerving from phrase to phrase, so that a West Indian can recognize the scene from his own
lived experience. He mixes elaborate and plainer modes of rhetoric. “The Hotel Normandie

Pool,” from The Fortunate Traveller, begins:

Around the cold pool in the metal light

of New Year’s morning, I choose one of nine
cast-iron umbrellas set in iron tables

for work and coffee. The first cigarette
triggers the usual fusillade of coughs. (439)

The poem builds a scene at poolside in Trinidad, at the Hotel Normandie. Not in a hurry, the
pace of the lines matches the relaxed atmosphere. It is early in the morning still. Re-reading the

poem, I still marvel at the semantic instability produced by a few uncanny metaphors, set off
