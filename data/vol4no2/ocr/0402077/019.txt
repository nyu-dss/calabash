he learns is that of master, meant to signify his benefactor. Friday is the very type of the docile
slave.

For all of that, one cannot say that Walcott accepts uncritically the benefaction of
England in “Crusoe’s Journal.” In recalling Friday’s education and religious conversion, he laces
with irony the tutelary process by which savages acquire (a European) language. The result is
that in his retelling the voice that speaks as mimicry is doubled and interrupts the finality of the
discourse that sanctions colonization, and that reproduces history as myth—the civilizing

mission—in the first place. He compares Crusoe to Columbus:

like Christofer he bears

in speech mnemonic as a missionary’ s
the Word to savages,

its shape an earthen, water-bearing vessel’s
whose sprinkling alters us

into Good Fridays who recite His praise,
parroting our master’s

style and voice, we make his language ours,
converted cannibals

we learn with him to eat the flesh of Christ. (93)

Deciding which parts of this passage to attribute to the poet’s own assessment, and which parts
to call borrowed or parodied, is scarcely possible. The hermeneutic ground upon which a reader
depends is a fluctuating terrain. Walcott implies or asserts: I was a savage when master brought
the Word to me; I acted like a bird that lacks human intelligence; I was once a pagan or
unconverted cannibal, but now I am a Christian cannibal. Surely, a reader says, Walcott means to
be satiric. There is bitterness here, a desire to obliterate English pretensions. In orderly, well-
regulated verse, he visits scorn upon “our” teachers (Columbus, Crusoe, Defoe—“our” masters);
their lessons (how to speak, the Christian doctrine); the method of acquiring knowledge
(mimicry); and even the classes of being to which he is restricted (savage, parrot, slave,
cannibal). The exercise of linguistic violence upon the savage produces no moral elevation. But
he also says—and, I suggest, throws out the possibility that the master’s conduct might be
redeemed—: “we make his language ours.” This statement is consistent with the process

described later in the poem of learning from the journals to “shape” “the language of a race.”

One and the same voice speaks both statements affirmatively. The bulk of the passage is so
