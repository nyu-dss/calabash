sentence stitches together “metal,” “cigarette,” “triggers,” and “coughs”—the iron cylinder of a
gun firing—and suggests that morning ensues upon violence, after the revels from the previous
night. It’s both an unpremeditated observation, and an unthinkable comparison.

There is also the phrase, “nine / cast-iron umbrellas.” One could probably look into the
prevailing building materials in the West Indies of the 1970s and find that cast-iron was much in
use then. The word “cast-iron” modifies the word “umbrellas.” Speak the phrase aloud, “‘cast-

“

iron umbrellas,” and you'll notice that the vocal movement from “iron” to “umbrellas” is
impeded, gathering the stress upon “cast-iron,” where it dwells. The phrase, in this context,
sounds like so much that I remember from my own life. Cast-iron umbrellas, noises of a fusillade

of gunfire, at a hotel near to water—I know those umbrellas, that poolside.

Derek Walcott grew up in St. Lucia, in the Eastern Caribbean or the Lesser Antilles, and went to
university and spent time in Jamaica on the other side of the archipelago. Memory contains the
arc of islands stretched, like the head above the body of a curving snake, just beneath the
peninsula of Florida over and down to the coast of South America at Guyana. Think of whales
visible towards the horizon as dark humps, sunning themselves in a gigantic arc. It takes longer
to fly from Kingston to Port of Spain than it does to fly from Kingston to New York. So when
one speaks of the West Indies as a place, one should be willing to explain what that means. And
the short explanation is: Créolité.

In the 1950s, when Walcott was in his twenties, the anglophone countries joined together
to establish the West Indies Federation, a political franchise that in time would secure
independence from Britain as an independent state. To West Indians of Walcott’s generation,
especially in the Eastern Caribbean, Federation held great promise. A new day was dawning for
the West Indies; as a Federation, the islands would be self-governing and comprise a single
national economy. Three years into the experiment, conflict arose. Jamaicans were unhappy with
the slow pace of departure from the empire. It was also felt that given its size and economic
standing, some of the political arrangements were unfair to the country. A referendum on
whether to stay or secede was put to the people in 1961. When I traveled to Grenada shortly after

the U.S. invasion, an older gentleman, hearing where I was from, recalled sadly the fate of the
