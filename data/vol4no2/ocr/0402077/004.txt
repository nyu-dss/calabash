In 1981, Walcott published The Fortunate Traveller, and a friend gave me a copy. By then I had
become involved with literature, particularly with French and Modern British poetry (meaning
poetry written by Americans and Irish), Russian and French fiction, the cataclysmic writings
coming out of Europe in the late 19" and early 20 century. What a relief that poets have other
topics and other ways of writing, I said. I never saw the point telling your reader how happy a
flower or a bird makes you. It’s time to move on. So it was a delightful shock to encounter the
poetry of Modernism.

Because of this interest of mine, I began to wonder about the West Indian poets I did not
read in school but whom I had heard of. And Walcott by then had become an international
figure, a garlanded world poet, frequenting the company of other world poets. The Fortunate
Traveller knocked my head sideways. By the time Walcott published this book I had read
enough classical and enough canonical English literature to see that he had absorbed and also
transfigured the contents of the Western Library. This process is distinctly audible in the earliest
books. The young poet performs a feat, and presents much more than the results of an exercise.
Still, there is something off-kilter, misplaced and fantastical, in his sincere regard for
masterpieces. Take the poem “In a Green Night” (from the 1962 volume of that name), and set to
one side the pun on the fourteenth-century Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Overlook the
archaic metaphor “orbs of brass,” hosting no “direct perception of the thing’ (Pound’s phrase),
when talking of oranges hanging from a branch. The poem repeats structures of thought and
vocabulary from at least two canonical authors to draft a meditation upon the natural cycle of
growth and decay, selecting an orange tree—a robustly tropical fruit—to teach the lesson.

Shakespeare’s Iago, in the famous lines on jealousy, has this to say:

O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock
The meat it feeds on. (III, iti, 165-167)

The word green, as a metaphysical rather than a psychological condition, uniting perceptible and
abstract qualities, is a signal flare in Marvell’s pastoral. A line from “Bermudas” furnishes

Walcott’s title: “He hangs in shades the Orange bright, / Like golden Lamps in a green Night”
