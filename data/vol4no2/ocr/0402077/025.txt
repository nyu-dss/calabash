with the linear elation of an eel
one muscle in one thought . . . (200-201)

The life lived in metaphor: “Gregorias would draw / with the linear elation of an eel.” To
compare drawing to the swimming of an eel! Dr. Johnson would object: incongruous ideas are
yoked together by violence, he would thunder. In effect, one could respond: precisely. The poet
crafts originality by doing violence to the language.

In order to add the poetry of the Antilles to a literature with its own long history and its
durable, memorable, tradition of poetry—Wordsworth’s “Solitary Reaper,” Keats’s “Ode to a
Nightingale,” Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind,” Arnold’s “Dover Beach”—the poet has to
knock things about; he must write against the grain of the poetry stored up in the canon,
especially if he has been schooled in the tradition of Romanticism and wishes, in turn, to engage
West Indian “nature.” The West Indian writer confronts an inertia in laying down the traditional
metrical line. To keep the line moving calls for stubbornness, a decision to be violent, to be

rough with the melody.

Under our grinding heel
the island burst to a crushed

odour of hogplums, acrid, exuding
a memory stronger than madeleines. (218; my italics)

Marcel Proust’s A la Recherche du Temps Perdu begins with a trivial episode: the narrator eats a
madeleine, a common French pastry served with tea, and the taste of the pastry opens a doorway
into the detailed recollections of his life. The hogplum, a common fruit in the West Indies,
ripens, falls, and rots in abundance in the countryside. The strong scent of the plums makes the
mouth water and clings to the memory of one’s youth. The hogplum stands in for Proust’s aide-
memoire; the audacity of yoking the word hogplum to the syntax of poetry that speaks of
madeleines—this is what I want to call attention to. The line “a memory stronger than
madeleines” can be scanned as three successive dactyls, the metrical pattern of the Homeric
epics: memory stronger than madeleines. It is literally a classical line, mellifluous, and replete
with nostalgia. But there is that earlier phrase, “odour of hogplums, acrid, exuding,” with the
stresses jammed together, hogplums, acrid, and the roughness of the d and g sounds, plus the

word “hogplums” itself, occupying the line like a weed, a bastard child. If you’ve trained your
