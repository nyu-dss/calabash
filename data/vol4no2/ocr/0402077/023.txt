once, in the conduct of an empire’s war. Like everybody else, like the women by the fence, the

“colonial upstart” waits for apocalypse:

and the side streets of Manhattan of sown with salt,
as those in the North all wait for that white glare
of the white rose of inferno, all the world’s capitals.

The scale of an empire, of all the world’s capitals, and the scale of a banana, of the small island,
apparently have to do with each other. The women talking by the fences are rooted in the
itinerant creole mind that encompasses both scales; they help to root that mind somewhere. They

mean something by their talk, and their posture; their experience is also part of what matters.

It is not incidental that Walcott chooses the “calligraphic” phrase “‘ciseau la mer” to explain the
mechanics of naming in creole speech. In the first place, metaphors of startling visibility are
Walcott’s signature poetic device. He is a painter after all. And like a canvas placed in just this
spot, here, in front of a coconut tree, Walcott’s images—sometimes explicitly—give the reader a
place to stand, a point of view from which to look out upon houses and the sea. The beginning of
Another Life positions the reader in front of a book: “Verandahs, where the pages of the sea / are
a book left open by an absent master / in the middle of another life” (145). A painter wishes to
capture a moment in time. Walcott wishes to craft kinetic metaphors that elongate the instant,
and that set the visible world into motion, focused through active verbs (the italics are my own):
“over the untroubled ocean the moon / will always swing its lantern / and evening fold the pages
of the sea” (293). The verb “swing” looks ahead to “lantern” and the verb “fold” looks ahead to
“pages.” The figurative noun will precede the verb and also follow it: “I watched the vowels curl
from the tongue of the carpenter’s plane” and “tongues of shavings coil from the moving pen”
(216). He writes extended metaphors rather than extended similes, the first elements of the trope
being put into place long before the dénouement. Time passes in his metaphors. The poem “The
Flocks” (The Castaway) sets up a comparison between migrating birds and arrows fired by a

longbow. Winter draws the bowstring:

The grip of winter tightening, its thinned
