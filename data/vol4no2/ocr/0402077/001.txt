THE PARTHENON IN TOBAGO:
ENCOUNTERING DEREK WALCOTT
AFTER THE 1970S°

I.

In the early 1980s I was in college in New York planning to become an engineer. One day I
changed my major to English. Myth has probably replaced memory, but say the switch was
driven by the poetry met with in a course: Hopkins, Yeats, Eliot, Pound, those modernist writers.
Pound—what was that? I had never heard the name. In high school, poetry meant the Romantics,
the Victorians. Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind” marked the high noon for all previous and
subsequent verse. The twentieth century was unfocused, not collected under the name of a
movement. Louis MacNeice’s “Carrickfergus” stayed with me, floating outside of time, as a

boyhood poem set in Ireland. I can still recite the beginning:

I was born in Belfast between the mountains and the gantries
To the hooting of lost sirens and the clang of trams:

Thence to Smoky Carrick in County Antrim

Where the bottle-neck harbour collects the mud which jams

The little boats beneath the Norman castle.

' This essay, in an earlier version, was first delivered as a lecture at George Washington University,
Washington, DC, in the fall of 2003.
