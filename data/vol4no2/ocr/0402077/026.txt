ear on Dylan Thomas and Hardy, to write “hogplums” is to perpetrate an ugliness, to rip into the
tissue of sounds that constitute the metrical fabric of the north. And then to let the line stand, and
further to stress the harshness through a clot of stresses and consonants, this says that you are
prepared to yoke incongruities together, by violence if necessary, to make the poem speak of a

tropical place.

. . . .

Walcott’s vision of that place, as tender as it is, reveals a history of horror. History marks the site
of a mass grave. And even memory cannot survive this holocaust. The lost populations of the

plantation are memorialized only in the unrecorded, amnesiac, generations of vegetation. From

Another Life:

the bois-canot responded to its echo,
when the axe spoke, weeds ran up to the knee
like bastard children, hiding in their names

Weeds and bastard children belong to the same family. They both grow in the wild. If the forest
teems, and if generations are born and die, no memorial marks their passing. The forest forgets
its ancestral populations. Nothing can be known of them. The poet glimpses an irretrievable past,

whitened over with amnesia. The open book of the sea cannot help, for the sea:

brings towards us, again and again, in beaten scrolls,
nothing, then nothing,
and then nothing. (287)

These lines on the sea, and on the generations, are so bleak that a reader searches for a way
around them. What sort of nothing does the sea bring? One says something like the following:
wave generates wave, as growth generates growth. As parts of a cycle, withering and dying do
not mark a final end. In the “Muse of History,” Walcott writes, paradoxically: “In time the slave

surrendered to amnesia. That amnesia is the true history of the New World” (39). Paradoxically,
