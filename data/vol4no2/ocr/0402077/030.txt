in his life, James writes: “I was British, I knew best the British way of life” (152)."° And now
bring the timeline forward by a generation, from James to Walcott. What do we find? Born three
decades after Victoria’s death, Walcott writes that he and his friends were “orphans of the
nineteenth century / sedulous to the morals of a style” that pervaded the school and household—
they were “Victoria’s orphans” (219). They lived in a Victorian era.

When World War II ended in the technological break through to Inferno at Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, Walcott would have been 15; and when Jamaica got its independence from
England, he would have been 32 and an adult. Across the world of English empire, soldiers
lowered the Union Jack. Statesmen re-stitched the map of the world into a coat of many colors.
These were momentous events: “as a sun, tired of empire, declined” (Another Life 148). But
Walcott’s memories of his youth, susceptible to the acrid odour of hogplums, have been set into

place long before, long before decolonization begins in the West Indies and Africa.

Because Walcott’s poetry is so compelling to me, and because I’ve re-read it for many years, ’m
conscious of an area that remains opaque, out-of-focus, strange—a patch of confusion that re-
reading, by itself, cannot eliminate. Edward Hirsch interviews Walcott in 1977. Here is an
excerpt from the interview that tells of the role of library and teachers in the formation of a
child’s self-confidence. And that expresses a doubt, an adult shift in the sense of his debt to the
heritage:

Q: .. . several of your early poems seem to reflect the English literary
tradition. Does that matter?

A: It was the way I began. I lived on a very small island [St. Lucia] with a
good library and fantastic teachers who made world literature accessible to me
from a very early age, and who treated me with remarkable familiarity. . . . The
availability of books and intelligent conversation gave me enough confidence to
be who I was....

... also felt it was a privilege to grow up as an English colonial child
because politically and culturally the British heritage was supposed to be mine. It
was no problem for me to feel that since I was writing in English, I was in tune
with the growth of the language. I was a contemporary of anyone writing in
English anywhere in the world. . . . (52-53).
