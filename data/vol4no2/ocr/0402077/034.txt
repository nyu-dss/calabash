now ex-colonial poet. Walcott’s poetry exposes and explodes that ideology; this was one of his
tasks, and it is a great part of his legacy. How does he rethink the function of the poet? In the
“The Muse of History,” he exchanges the places of subaltern and prince, while transposing
empire from territory to language, retaining an empire that the poet sustains and replenishes.
Maddening, strange reversals these are that do not break free from empire—that bestow
upon the poet the symbolic prestige of an imperial prince. West Indian poetry owes a debt to the
empire for language. Yes, but there must be other ways of grasping the poet’s relationship to
English other than through the metaphor of an empire. Why not the metaphor of a garden, or a
forest? Can’t speech get past the borders of empire? Why choose this particular metaphor? And
perhaps the answer to such tumbling questions lies with the meaning and force of England for

that generation, born about 1930.
