so that I could “discuss” the symbolism of names, the imagery of costume and countryside, the
virtues of rustic character planted in the soil. What is the good of this, aside from being able to
pass the test?

Fingering the culprit of my incomprehension is a parlor game: bad teachers; books from
England for a West Indian’s schooling; personal obtuseness; some people just can’t read poetry.
All of the above. I have heard it deplored that the syllabus did not represent our speech and our
imagination, what we daily perceive and the way we verbalize perception: “The hurricane does
not roar the pentameter.” Does this explain the difficulties I had? I don’t believe so. Within a
year after leaving school and showing up at university, like everybody else I fell into the vortex
of Conrad and Dostoevsky; and a little later, of Eliot, Joyce, and Pound. (In those days, if
memory serves, Pound’s anti-Semitism and fascism merely stained, they did not pollute, his
reputation; and even when discussing “Gerontion,” where “the Jew squats on the windowsill,” or
Mr Eugenedies, the déclassé, unsavory Smyrna merchant from The Waste Land, who invites the
poet to a resort known for its homosexual patrons, no one mentioned Eliot’s bigotry.) So I
suspect that it was not the absence in lived experience alone that disabled Wordsworth or Hardy,
and in spite of which I enjoyed MacNeice, but the way these texts failed to solicit one’s interest.
They were not modern.

Scandalously, I cannot recall reading any poems by Derek Walcott or by any other West
Indian, not even by Claude McKay. The names of the post World War II intellectuals certainly
were in circulation to anyone who read a little bit among the Sunday arts pages of a newspaper.
But did I read their novels and poems in school? Did I read Naipaul, Roger Mais, Andrew
Salkey? We did read Achebe and Camara Laye in those days, I remember that, Shakespeare,
Arnold Wesker, Shelley. Easy enough to check on the West Indians, but embarrassingly—I can’t
say for sure now. What stayed with me, you see, opaquely, were the names on the test, the
writings of the British canon. And for the most part these texts were quite dead to me.
Everything was disciplined by a moral code, harnessed to a sturdy belief that literature shapes

character, or something like that.
