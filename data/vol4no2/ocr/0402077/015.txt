Walcott was once charged with holding a less than satisfactory ideological posture. None of my
contemporaries would have written “acquiesced.” Nanny the Maroon, Sam Sharpe, Paul Bogle,
Marcus Garvey—where in the pages of their struggle does one find acquiescence? Whatever the
historical truth, a resolute anti-colonial would have chosen to record a different sequence, surely
including the catalogue of revolts on the plantations and the Maroon wars of the 18" century.

The word “acquiesced” conjures distasteful notions of African docility.

A small detour into history. After Federation fails, after Independence, time accelerates for new-
born nation-states. No longer subject to an empire from which they draw political standing and
economic support, they must hurry to catch up with the West. The must seek moderity on their
own. If, as Fanon writes, culture forms the infrastructure of the nation, then everyone begins to
discuss cultural identity. What is the national culture? This means: What is the nation?

By the late 1960s, one compelling answer has been framed. Inspired by the Civil Rights
Movement and the activism of figures such as Walter Rodney and Malcom X, there develops in
the West Indies a powerful movement towards Black cultural nationalism. Some governments—
Jamaica, Guyana, for example—swerve to the left, towards an emancipationist agenda dedicated
to bettering conditions for the urban and rural poor: “Better must come.” It was not only an
economic and educational program. It was also an attempt to abolish class and caste distinctions
built upon color. One way to put it is to say that intellectuals in and out of the government
wanted to ground the nation in a particular vision of culture and history, with people of African
descent—the black masses, to use the political rhetoric of the time—placed at the core of the
national society. Slavery as former oppression, neo-colonialism, neo-imperialism as
contemporary expressions of the same disabling conditions that obtained in the past: people
spoke and wrote much about these matters during my youth.

People also spoke much of the leaders of African anti-colonial nationalism, Julius
Nyerere, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenneth Kaunda, and Patrice Lumumba. Jamaicans were concerned
with the rise and fall of governments in Latin and Central America; with the friendship with our
neighbor in Cuba, Fidel Castro; with the wars in Namibia, Mozambique, and Angola; and with

the almost daily horrors of apartheid South Africa. Steve Biko died in police custody in 1977.
