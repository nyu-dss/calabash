Federation. The vote of Jamaica to withdraw from the nascent state precipitated its collapse. Of
course I knew of this episode in West Indian history, but I had never heard it spoken of with
regret. So many political developments riveted our attention in the intervening decades that the
period of Federation was like a mist, a chimera. But this older gentleman on his verandah, one
year after the murder of the prime minister, and the landing of U.S. marines, had not forgotten
the Jamaican referendum, had always felt that then a chance had been missed. And so, sitting
down with a Jamaican visitor, he gently deplored Jamaica’s choice, as he must have on other
occasions during the two decades since that time.

The brief conversation with the gentleman told me that, elsewhere in the West Indies, it
was possible still to feel the absence of a greater pan-Caribbean unity. The failure to sustain a
union has economic consequences for a small place such as Grenada or St. Lucia that a larger
island does not notice. Walcott’s poetry treats this failure. “The Star-Apple Kingdom” castigates
the prime ministers who “cut up” the West Indies and sold the islands “at a markup to...
conglomerates” (390). In the autobiography, he suggests that the collapse of Federation into
political disunity is a tell-tale sign of deeper fractures. This diagnosis becomes more
understandable if one recognizes how disheartening that collapse was at the time, and how
prolonged was the regret. Contemplating vegetable life, roots and leaves of the forest, the poet

departs from visual inspection, and envisions the entire span of the archipelago. From Another

Life (1973)°:

here was a life older than geography,
as the leaves of edible roots opened their pages
at the child’s last lesson, Africa, heart-shaped,

and the lost Arawak hieroglyphs and signs
were razed from slates by sponges of the rain,
their symbols mixed with lichen,

the archipelago like a broken root,
divided among the tribes . . . (196)

6 No doubt much of what I have to say about Another Life, a text which continues to astonish me, has

been tinged and turned by Edward Baugh’s seminal study of that poem, Derek Walcott: Memory as
Vision: Another Life (London: Longman, 1978).
