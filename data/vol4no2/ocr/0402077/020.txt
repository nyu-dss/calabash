contemptuous of missionary assumptions—the phrase “Good Fridays” offends no less than
“Good Negroes’”—that a reader is tempted to conclude, nonetheless, that the speaker disowns
what he asserts; that he describes himself as seen through missionary eyes and in the same verbal
gesture ridicules their (his) vision.

What remains after such sifting (shifting) reflections is the blunt perception that no
alternative narrative of self-fashioning is on offer. One might complain of the word “parroting,”
and replace it with the Latin imitans; or press the point that not all others are cannibals. The
structure of the encounter—the vector of cultural power from here to there, teacher to pupil,
master to slave, Englishman to savage—remains central to the myth of origins, and is left
undisplaced. Trapped inside a scenario he grasps as offensive to dignity, the poet does not
acquiesce to the narrative of servile imitation. Rather, he lashes out. Something of Caliban’s
implacable resentment animates the irony, and colors his words with violence. After all, if
obedient to doctrine, the savage is still a converted cannibal, having swapped one kind of flesh

for another.

Whatever the claims and counter-claims of the post-independence era, which I will not rehearse
further, the bitterness of the controversy over cultural authenticity chars the pages of his
autobiography. Picking it up in chapter four, in the plot of the story, the poet has recently learned
that Harry Simmonds, his boyhood mentor, one “master” in a text that has several, has just

committed suicide, alone and in a remote part of the island.

And perhaps, master, you saw early

what brotherhood means among the spawn of slaves
hassling for return trips on the middle passage,
spitting on their own poets . . . (265)

The medusa of slavery transfixes the demagogue; and the fixation on history breeds

exhibitionism, a victim ideology. Worse, people spit on their own poets.

Those who peel from, from their own leprous flesh, their names,
who chafe and nurture the scars of rusted chains,

like primates favouring scabs, those who charge tickets

for another free ride on the middle passage,

those who explain to the peasant why he is African. . . (269)
