(330).” Marvell returns elsewhere to this color. The poet’s mind in “The Garden” creates and
transcends “other Worlds, and other Seas”: “Annihilating all that’s made / To a green Thought in
a green Shade” (328). Together with this perilous green, the structure of harming while feeding
that Iago ascribes to jealousy crops up in “The Mower against Gardens.” Luxurious man treats
the world as his “green Seraglio” (317). He seduces the world to vice, building a garden to
enclose the flowers and fields, formerly growing in the open. He replaces nature with alluring

artifice:

And a more luscious Earth for them did knead
Which stupefi’d them while it fed. (my italics; 316)

Into this cacophony—company—falls Walcott’s “green yet aging orange tree” set beneath a
“golden sun” that ripens and tarnishes its “orbs of brass.” The metrical and lexical imitation of
Marvell (“stupefied them while it fed”) and Shakespeare (“doth mock / The meat it feeds on”) is

patent in the fourth line below:

For if by night each golden sun

Burns in a comfortable creed,

By noon harsh fires have begun

To quail those splendours which they feed. (my italics; 50)’

But so too is the philosophical attitude characteristic of Wallace Stevens in Harmonium, namely,
that dying and flourishing are the same event. Stevens writes in “Le Monocle de Mon Oncle”:
“The honey of heaven may or may not come, / But that of earth both comes and goes at once”
(15).* Echoing both the idea and the syntax here, Walcott reflects upon the ”strange, cyclic

chemistry / That dooms and glories her [the orange tree] at once” (50).

describes the peculiar unconcern of a bird on Sunday morning. In the company of oranges, a significant
and allusive detail, the bird’s “green freedom” appears:
