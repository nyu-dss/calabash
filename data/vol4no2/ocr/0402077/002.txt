The teacher explained that the Norman castle, which towers above the little boats, symbolizes
English military dominance over the Irish. The poem, in the voice of a boy, notices the castle
without drawing the political lesson. The boy is too young to see that spatial positions express
relations of power.

The teacher explained the poem; that’s not why I remembered it. I remembered it because
of “hooting” and “clang” and “smoky Carrick” and “mud which jams,” because of the jangle of
sounds. Is “Carrick” a type of barn, a smokestack? What is “Antrim”? Weren’t the Normans at
Hastings? The teacher explained that the sirens meant factories, laborers who rode on trams. And
in Carrick, the Irish were the masses who served the English lords high up in their Norman
castle. Norman means English.

I tried hard to feel this interpretation, to make it sing spontaneously as I read the words.
That did not happen. The poem said one set of things, the teacher said another. Metonymy
(sirens for factory, clang for urban working class bustle) evokes the full context only if
experience precedes it: life in a noisy city, or familiarity with the representations of such a life. A
schoolboy from Belfast reads MacNeice’s poem within the aura of direct perception and
memory. A Jamaican from Kingston, on the other hand, must methodically infer rather than
respond to the city. Perhaps I am idealizing the Irish reader here. Poetry will always mystify
some youngsters.

The poetry I remember reading had the stupefying effect of mystifying speech that stops
short of provoking questions. We were left in a limbo of inarticulate incomprehension. What is
“Carrick”? Or, in Wordsworth’s “The Solitary Reaper,” put in the anthology under “Nature”—
“Behold her, single in the field, you solitary Highland Lass’”—what is “Highland”? Is “Lass”
different from “girl”? What is a “Highland Lass’? The answers, which the teacher supplied, had
a limited utility: Carrick is the name of a town in Ireland; in English vernacular, /ass means
young woman or girl. These answers stir no memory. But then again the unexpressed questions
pointed to gaps in experience, to a lived absence that a definition, a gloss, cannot remedy. This
absence—perceptions that were never there—lay at the heart of the matter. And because of it,
incomprehension blocked the whole poem; the meaning of the exercise of reading this poem and
studying it; and, ultimately, the meaning of studying any poetry at all. What is the good of this?
Thomas Hardy’s Far From the Madding Crowd, being a novel, prolonged the duration of the

question. I read this book seven times for an examination, memorizing paragraphs and exegeses
