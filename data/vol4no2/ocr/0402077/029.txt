city. Queen’s Street, King’s Street, Victoria Park, Prince Albert this or that. West Indians
walked, shopped, set up market stalls, drove automobiles, congregated, and went to work in
places with names such as these. The streets around the harbor in Kingston and the churches,
government offices, and stores in that quarter had about them an antiquated air, as if some slow
drama from the previous century refused to close. My great grandmother, born in the 1880s,
lived in our house when I was growing up. Her grandmother had been a slave.

Increasingly, through the decade of the 1970s, Jamaica changed into a violent place.
Certainly, the colonial West Indies had long been vortices of extreme cruelty and barbarism. In
my own lifetime, slums arose in the city with their own cycle and circle of violence, their bastard
children picking through rubbish dingles for bottles to sell. Gunmen aligned with political parties
come from these slums: they not only kill each other, they threaten political rallies, generally run
amok. Bob Marley organizes a peace concert that brings the political leaders onto the stage to
shake hands. They promise to end the violence. The violence escalates. The upper middle classes
move to Miami. The economy goes bust. This is only part of the story. As a society, Jamaica had
reoriented its horizon away from Europe and England and towards other parts of the world. We
lived through a period of promise that was alive with music, the reforms of democratic socialism,
new world alliances, the causes of self-determination and human rights, and we lived through a
period of intense violence. Foreign and local affairs preoccupied us, Latin America, Africa, the
Caribbean: not England.

I’m trying to get at a generational gulf—an abyss, really—that separates the people of my
generation from those West Indians born in the vicinity of 1930, a little before or a little after, the
generation of Walcott and many other illustrious writers: the intellectuals of the Caribbean
Artists Movement, let us say. The generation of my parents and their siblings. And this gulf has
to do with the meaning and force of England. A stray memory sometimes speaks to me of an
English king “killed by an arrow while hunting.” I can’t recall which king it was, and it is not
that disturbing to have this phrase mingled with my half-awake dreams at night. When I was a
boy, the elementary school history book, resembling nothing so much as a late Medieval
chronicle, summarized the reigns of English monarchs, enclosed within their dates, starting from
William the Conqueror. This was to be our history, and it is why I remember the fragment about
the dead king. Step back to an much earlier epoch in the West Indies, however. C.L.R. James, the
Trinidadian Marxist, used to lecture in Port of Spain on Wordsworth in the 1920s. Of this period
