PARANG SERENADE IN TWO PARTS

I.

It wasn’t your song.

No Rio Manzanares di you beg,
“Dejame pasar’ neither

Did you open the door

When paranderos cajoled,

“Abreme la perta! Abreme la puerta!”

Los esposos Maria y Jose

Van desde Nazareth,

But you climbed

Onto a donkey cart,

Burrowed deeper into tall, tall,

Sugar canes La Paille, Caroni, Morong.

Quatro and mandolin Din Din Din,

Es hora de partir,

Did not rouse you from a coir mattress
Sleep that only Cannes Brulee

Sweet smoke sugarcane fire

Could rouse you awake in Petit Careme.

Las maracas Clap Clap Clap,
Bottle and spoon Ping Ping Ping.
Daisy Voisin Parang Queen,
Sereno sereno her pagnol rhythm
As foreign as ground beef pastelle
You never ate sacred Mai Gaay
