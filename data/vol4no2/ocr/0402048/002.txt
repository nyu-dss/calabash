Nor did you speak Espanol.

Your lights weren’t candles at Christmas
But dejays at Divali.

El nino Jesus was no Baby Krishna blue
And Jesus’ birthday went with rum,
Curry manioc and chutney.

Il.

But I have songs for you my mothers
In my blood. I take you with me

My Ajee, my Nani, my Mowsee

My Kaakee, my Daadee, my Phoowaa.
I serenade “Dejame pasar Rio Caroni’,
On my way to Chacachacare,

“Dejame psar Rio Valencia’,
On my way to Toco,
“Dejame pasar Rio Ortoire”’,
On my way to Guayaguayare,
“Dejame pasar Rio Guapo”,
On my way to Icacos.

I sprinkle your ashes on every corner
Of this Iere, Land of the Hummingbird.
I absorb parang through my pores.

I partake of pastelle and puncha créme.
I understand, “Din, din, din,

Es hora de partir.”

“Din, din, din, camino de Belen,

Los esposos van desde Nazareth.”

I know the Christmas story,

The gift of Baby Jesus born in a manger,
And how in his name Guanahani
Became San Salvador,

Then sugar became king.

They crossed you over the Kala Pani,

But when you cried, “Darvaza kholna prasann!”
No one understood you.

All the knew was, “Abreme la puerta!”

And they kept the door closed.

Per oven, vena qui mi Ajee, mi Nani,
Mi Mowsee, Kaakee, Daadee, Phoowaa.
