Collective features a visual artist for that month’s gathering, who displays his/her work
prior to oral renditions of the poetry and song. A chat-back session in which the artist
discusses his/her work and fields questions from the audience follows the display
segment. The monthly events also frequently feature a local or international musician.
And last but not least, there are featured poets. Most recently, a fifteen year old poet, a
young woman who had just published her first book of poetry, was the featured reader.
Alexander and Yanique both celebrate the success of the event to attract these guest
artists. Alexander’s recollection of past guests include, “Eltino Pickering, on the steel
pan, Sister Khuuma Ama, a poet visiting from NY, Oleik Ledee an accordion player
(who also happens to be blind), Erwin Dorsett who performed his original compositions
on piano, and vocalists of different genres: reggae, etc.” Yanique adds a few more names,
such as well known Caribbean poets, Everton Sylvestor (of the Green Card Poets of
Brooklyn) and Mutabaruka, as well as Gene Emanuel, and recording reggae artist
Desiree.

It is clear from the previous list of artists that the Rock Lounge attracts not only
local Virgin Islander artists, but also artists from the Caribbean regional and the larger
international black community. The fact that local, regional, and more international artists
know about the Rock Lounge as a space, is no accident. It is testament to the continued
support for the space/event from the local newspapers that frequently profiles the artists
and special events, and other establishments such as The Virgin Islands Council on the
Arts, and The Community Foundation of the Virgin Islands. A financial grant from the
latter two groups provided funds for start up costs and to purchase sound equipment. But
Yanique pointed out that one of the major projects still remains ensuring constant
financial support, which can in turn bring in more artists who might be a “big African-
American [artist] or Caribbean [artist] in America.” The “bigger-name” artists often
require greater monetary compensation for their services. Financial support is not really a
problem for the day to day logistics because passing the hat usually covers buying
batteries for the sound equipment, which remains the most pressing need that occurs
mostly because the collective operates on strictly a volunteer basis.

For the artists who frequent the space, money takes a backseat to the opportunity

to build and perform with each other because most of them are employed elsewhere as
