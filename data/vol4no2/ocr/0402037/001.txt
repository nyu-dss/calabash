ROCK CITY’S ROCK LOUNGE:
THE POETICS AND AESTHETICS
OF COMMUNITY

Similar to St. John and St. Croix, the Caribbean island of St. Thomas in the U.S.
Virgin Islands is generally figured as a tourist space. A simple google of St. Thomas
produces the nice catch phrases such as “most popular destination” for vacationers, or as
a Virgin Islander would say, for those from state-side. It is extremely difficult to find
scholarship on St. Thomas that does not frame the island as primarily a tourist venue.
Even to the island’s nick name, Rock City, can imply the partying dimension, which in
turn can resonate in the tourist discourse already surrounding its bordering waters. What
this perception can hide the fact that Rock City and the other islands of the non-
continental U.S. territory have a cultural history that resonates outside the parameters of
tourism. Like their Caribbean brother- and sister-nations, Virgin Islanders proudly trace
their histories to the Arawaks, Caribs, and Africans, whose linguistic and cultural
influences permeate daily life. Summarily speaking, much else besides tourism happens.
Visual art happens there, poetry happens there, music happens there, and it is not only to
support or to be supported by the tourist industry. For example, Rock City’s “Rock
Lounge” is spoken word spot that celebrates the diverse Caribbean culture on the island
community, which is bombarded with US influence via tourists and white American

residents.
