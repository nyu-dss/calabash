together. A space where painters, musicians and poets could feed off each other’s vibe. A
space for Virgin Islanders to showcase their art selves and build a base for a non-

’

institutionalized artistic community.” The need for a non-institutionalized space for
Virgin Islanders comes into critical dialogue with the tourist-frequented open mics, or
what Alexander describes as the other “musical open mics” on the island centered in local
bars. Those venues did not and do not cater neither to the needs of most of the local
artists, nor to the concerns of the local community. Alexander cautions that those spaces
do no reflect the social and demographic realities of St. Thomas, given that most of the
attendees and participants at musical open mics were and continue to be primarily “white
stateside folks.” In other words, the nature of tourism as an institution, and as it focuses
on “local star” art and “local star’ art performance, creates a space that invariably
precludes the possibility and practice of community in which the seven-year-old primary
school student, her mother, the university faculty member, custodial staff, and the
published writer, as described earlier by local journalist David Sawissa, can create and
participate as fully-realized Rock City artists and patrons.

One pressing concern of the founding and current members has been maintaining
a truly egalitarian space, where each poet and artist has ample room to create, and,
quoting Alexander, to “share their creativity with others in a non-threatening and non-
competitive space.” Therefore, ensuring that no preference is given to any one of the arts
to the detriment of the others also is of great concern to the Rock Collective from its
inception, as seen by the fact that the founding and current members represent artists
from multiple genres and artistic disciplines. For example, Yanique is both a local poet
and short story writer, and a Fulbright scholar who studied in Trinidad and the United
States. Alexander is a poet and an administrator at the University of the Virgin Islands.
Also, three of the young men, Kenrick Augustus, Akin Chinnery, and Abraham
Muhammad (a visual artist), who were recruited Tiphanie Yanique to assist in developing
the Rock Collective and the Rock Lounge, were poets and musicians. Currently the
active members of the Rock Collective are Alexander, Jahweh David and Dara Cooper;

Cooper and David dabble in multiple genres.

To further ensure that there is representation from the different elements, the
