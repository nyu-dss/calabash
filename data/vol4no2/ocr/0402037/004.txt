mission.” Alexander also describes the dynamic of uplift and centrality; she further
specifies that there is no cover charge for the event: “Every once in a while we “pass the
hat” to obtain funds for printing our flyers, batteries for the CD players and other
miscellaneous expenses.” Over the years they’ve “passed the hat” and asked performers
and audience members to patronize local establishments such as L’Hotel Boynes, the
Marisol Restaurant, and more recently the Frenchtown Deli. Of course, one consistent
struggle has been ensuring that people view monetary patronage of the host sites as
essential to both the survival of the event and the host-establishment/business’s financial
health.

The history of business establishments and their relationship with the artistic
community of St. Thomas includes efforts at collaboration. Both the business and artist
communities, in conjunction with the University of the Virgin Islands, have collaborated
in order to create venues for showcasing art on the island. The Frenchtown Deli, the
current home of the Rock Lounge, hosted an occasional poetry presentation and art
exhibit. Other business establishments also provided spaces for local artists to showcase
their work at University sponsored and publicized events. Alexander “first began to
organize open mic events in 1997 through the Humanities Division of UVI at L’ Hotel
Boynes,” but the events ceased after an administration change in 2001. However, the
founders of the Rock Lounge still regarded a relationship with UVI, primarily the faculty
and staff, as central in the formation of any consistent artistic venture aimed at
community uplift. One University faculty member, Dr. Vincent Cooper, served as an
advisor to the group. Subsequently, in this developmental stages, they questioned how to
centralize and make more consistent the occasional artistic events and efforts occurring
on the island.

There is an important distinction to make here. Although the Rock Lounge as an
event, and Rock Collective as a collaboration of artists, continued to have a relationship
with the University of the Virgin Islands and the business establishments, the autonomy
of the artists and the event remain as high as a priority as it was when the Collective
decided that the Rock Lounge would be held in those spaces. Yanique retrospectively

summarizes the urge for artistic autonomy in her description of the vision for the Rock

Lounge: “To create a space where visual art, musical art and literary art can come
