Sawisa’s describes an environment that contrasts on myriad levels the popular perception
(and praxis) that poetry lounges operate as spaces of stratification and specialization.”
The focus on family in the space goes counter to the idea of age- or generational-
stratification. David Sawissa celebrates the Rock Lounge as a space that celebrates and
fosters the idea and practice of non-competition. The mere presence and participation of a
custodial worker alongside a seven year old, a university professor, a published writer, a
radio personality, and a college student images the lounge as a venue where inter-
disciplinary, inter-generational, and inter-class dialogue flourishes because of heavy no-
stars vibrations. Poetry at the Rock Lounge is a Rock City Family thing.

The specters of the family described by Sawissa also permeate the May 2003
mission statement of the Rock Collective, the founding group who imagined the Rock
Lounge. The Rock Collective describes itself as “an informal, non-profit organization
dedicated to nurturing artistic energy in the Virgin Islands.” Its mission: “to provide a
free and welcoming space on St. Thomas for the sharing of music, creative writing, and
visual and performance art.” The collective was founded partly because the members

’

recognized that St. Thomas, “as both a Caribbean and American entity,” needed to
“actively participate in grass roots performance art sweeping the region and the nation.”
The mission statement specifies, “Through its initiatives, The Rock Collective strives to
be successfully in providing the youthful and vibrant artistic community of St. Thomas
with a space — both figurative and physically — in which to achieve this end.”

One of such initiatives involves the economics and politics of choosing the space.
In email-interviews, two members of the founding core, Mary Alexander and Tiphanie
Yanique, both confirm that the politics of making that decision relates directly to ideals
of business community uplift as well as centrality. Yanique explains, “We’ve had the
event at many different spots... in a central location and also in a place that would benefit
from our presence... at an independently owned spot where food was served, so the
house could benefit.” She continues, “Since the Rock Lounge was about upliftment of
the community we felt uplifting restaurant owners, chefs, hotels was in step with our
* Speaking from stateside, one of results of having a proliferation of poetry and poetry spots in urban and
college town settings is that the venues become stratified. That is, certain spots come to be known for

certain types of poets and poetry. And subsequently, people splinter off to form their own venue/spot. I

cannot say that this is a good or bad thing, as there are benefits and drawbacks.
