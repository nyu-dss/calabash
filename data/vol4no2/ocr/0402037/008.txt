use the space(s) as a way to retain culture, and to support and encourage the artistic
creations of local artists while exposing them to each other’s work as well as the work of
off-island creative spirit. The primary goal is always community: artistic, business, or
Rock City community and Caribbean community at-large. Indeed, some artists have
butted heads with the poetics of community when they attempted to use the space for
their “personal advancement”; and there were also a few instances situations where
members of the audience have felt alienated based on their sexual orientation, race, or
religious beliefs. However, in those particular instances created opportunities for the
community of scholars, poets, continentals, custodians, mothers, daughters, sons,
students, organizers, activists, and artists to challenged itself and each other to ensure that
the alienation was merely temporary. The effort of the Rock Collective still remains as
their mission statements advocates “to be successful in providing the youthful and vibrant
artistic community of St. Thomas with a space — both figuratively and physically — to
achieve this end,” with this end being “the sharing of grassroots music, creative writing,
and visual and performance art.”

And the Rock City’s Rock Lounge has been successful in those ends, to celebrate
and create community. As Bayley K. Garbutt observed for his Humanities 115 class at
UVI: “Where the magic lies, is in the people that support the Rock Lounge and the
audience [who are] so much involved in the stimulation of creativity. Both times I was
there, a new person was inspired to write and was willing to share it with the audience. It
is the friendly environment that I’m sure is a testament to the success of the Rock
Lounge.”

Or as Rock Lounge poet Jahweh David puts it:

“Can we not see that we have been brought through the thighs of divinity?...

We need to visualize the God within ourselves and create our own destiny.

With self-determination.”
