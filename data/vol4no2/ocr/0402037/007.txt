teachers, custodial workers, professors, radio personalities, actors, etc. In her article,
“Rock Collective: The cultural pulse of a people,” local writer, journalist, and
businesswoman, Mary Blake, describes the members of the collective as “some of the
hottest artistic talents and soul-jah’s... [c]ultural revolutionaries bent on freeing the
masses from spiritual slavery.” If David Sawissa’s descriptions in his feature of the Rock
Collective celebrated their poetics of family and community, Blake’s descriptions chart
the members of the Rock Collective as local revolutionaries armed with “spiritual
energy.” She contends that this “connection to spirit and respect for culture that has put
them in the position to bridge the gap between the elders and the youth.” Discussing
further her relationship to Virgin Island culture and history, one of the younger poets,
Dara Monifah, describes the “current state of culture in the Virgin Islands as a volcano

you can still feel what is in here. Africa is in here.”

Blake’s feature, in combination with Alexander and Yanique’s descriptions of the

the beginning of that year’s Rock Fling, “The audience at Club Amnesia was first treated
with the sounds of the Echo People, a St. John group whose musical works incorporate
folkways of Nigeria.” She adds, “[T]hese artists also showed their attachment to modern
aspects of African culture. The original poetry performed between songs was reminiscent
of jazz clubs and urban city living; a slow bongo drum accompaniment easily
transformed the club at these moments into a “Midtown” coffee house.”

As can be gleaned from the consistent naming of the events and the collective—
Rock Fling, Rock Collective and Rock Lounge—the goal is to celebrate both Rock City

and the artistic voices and sounds of the island community. The goal remains simple: to
