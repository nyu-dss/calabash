A brief examination of the history of the Rock Lounge not only highlights how
local artists create and share their art without catering to/accounting for the tourist
sensibility, but also enables us to engage with history—struggles and triumphs—of a
spoken word venue not located in the continental United States; much of our limited
understanding of the poetry lounge as a space remains contintental-centric. Since the late
’90s, the spoken word movement has taken off as urban phenomena; some spoken word
artists, such as writer and actor Saul Williams, have almost gained household name
status, record and book deals, while several others have at least gotten their five or ten
minutes in the limelight, so to speak, via ventures like Def Poetry Jam. Certain spoken
word spots, such as the Nuyorican Poetry Café in Losaida, NY, or the Brooklyn Moon
Café, have also gained that star status as must-be and must-see spaces. But the struggles
of smaller venues to establish themselves and secure continued patronage can go
unnoticed.

In a local newspaper’s review of “The Rock Lounge,” local journalist David
Sawissa, in the introduction to his feature article, describes a space that for all intents and
purposes could be seen as an “artist colony.” He begins, “What brings together a seven-
year-old, a college student, a custodial worker, a radio personality, a published writer and

a university professor? Poetry.” Sawisa questions further, and then concludes,

“What was best? Valerie Pigott’s powerful poem about the return of an
estranged father, Robert Luke’s poignant love poem to the haunting
sounds of his bongos? Was it seven year old Franqui Benjamin’s “Happy
Birthday mommy” poem or her 11 year old sister Tanya’s insightful poem
“Age is just a number?” Or the proud look on their mother’s face before
she read her own poem? Or the 30-year-old rapping about her near death
infatuation with an 18 year-old (“and I didn’t see ‘Stella’” she quipped!).
Was it Tregenza Roach’s essay on good-bye’s and memories? It was all

the best. No stars. Just poets appreciating each other’s work.”!
