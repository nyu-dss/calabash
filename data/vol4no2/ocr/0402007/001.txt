FACING MOUNT LIAMUIGA:
A ST. KITTS ODYSSEY

I was born in my grandmotherâ€™s house on Pedra Street in the village of Sandy
Point, St. Kitts, which was once the heart of the British West Indies. The village sits in
the shadow of 3,792-foot high Mount Liamuiga. The mountain dominated my
imagination as a child when the British called it Mount Misery. The name was rejected
eventually when the people of St. Kitts claimed their independence and renamed the
mountain Liamuiga, using the name the indigenous Caribs had given our island to reflect
its fertile volcanic heritage. A large group of the remaining Caribs, who claim their own
Territory in Dominica, have also now claimed a name for themselves as the Kalinago
people, to reflect their own linguistic tradition and not that of the European invaders who
descended upon this place in the sixteenth century.

In the modern era, it is a tremendous difficulty to imagine this island in the
sixteenth century, with the exception, perhaps, of Mount Liamuiga, which sits up high,
virtually unchanged.

It is difficult even to imagine the island in 1915, the year approximate when my
great-grandmother, Annie Mason Garvey, left my grandmother, Elzeva Mason Garvey a
girl of about 18, to move to St. Croix in the then Danish West Indies. The house on
Pedra Street still stands, though sad, and lonely, and almost broken, making it easier to
imagine a time more recent, the 1960s, when my mother wrestled with her own decision
to leave the island of her birth and to settle in St. Thomas, where she still lives.

This is our own house of spirits, a wooden house, with shingle siding, small but

beautiful, built in three parts in a year that no one remembers. And it did not always stand
