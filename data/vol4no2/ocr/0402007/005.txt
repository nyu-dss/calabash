In each poem, I tried not to dwell on regret, but instead, in every way I could, I
tried to reflect the bravery of these women who had no choice but to confront and master
the lives which they had been givenâ€”to pick up the pieces when necessary and to move
anywhere which seemed to offer a life they could love.

My mother, Iona, is the third in the line, and she, too, took up her life, with us in
tow, and moved it. She inspired The Kingdom of Cloth. She was a seamstress by the
time I was born, and cloth of every kind dominated each room where we lived in the
house in Pedra Street and everywhere we moved as nomads in St. Thomas until the house
in the Tutu valley became the settling place. I inherited from my mother Iona her love of
both cloth and color.

These three poems celebrate the three women, Annie Mason Garvey, Elzeva
Mason Garvey and Iona Roach Bethel who took the little that they were given and made
a way for a large and varied clan which stretches now across Europe and the United
States and the beautiful Caribbean. In truth, I owe them my life and the great substance of

my imagination.
