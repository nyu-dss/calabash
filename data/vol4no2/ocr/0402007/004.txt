harvest. It was hard to leave, but harder still to stay on an island whose economy was
resting on a single crop, and one which appeared to thrive only on slave labor.

After we left St. Kitts, I did not see my grandmother, Mam, again until I was
about 14 when she took to the air for the first time to come and visit us on this new island
St. Thomas which was awash in tourism and development and whose hallmark was the
United States dollar. It was the height of the 1960s and Mam was now almost eighty
years old.

Mam and Papa Bethel never ceased to be the center of my world, even with the
passing time and even though we now lived on separate islands with so much of the sea
between us. They dominated my memory, and I still believed in their vision of the world.

It was so that I listened intently one day of her visit when I was 14 and she and I
were speaking. “Ah wish me mudda min ya,” she said, looking out to the sea and to the
south by coincidence to St. Croix where my great grandmother is buried. Translated, her
remark, “I wish my mother was here.”

I was but a child when she spoke of her longing for her mother, but the sentiment
never left me. The women had parted when she was 18, and Mam never saw Annie again.

There were neither telephones nor writing between them, two women, one born in
1897 and the other around 1867, and so I believe it safe to say that they had no words
other than those exchanged on that sad day when they parted and the water made its
course.

I imagined one day when I was contemplating her strength that I would use this
memory of my grandmother’s sentiment to speak to my great grandmother on her behalf,
and so the poem Annie Mason 1915 came to life.

Writing of ancestors takes the writer on a journey to spirit, and after I had written
Annie Mason, I agonized over what Annie would say to her daughter Elzeva, my
grandmother Mam, about her decision to leave the place of their birth.

I imagined how difficult Annie’s life, and that of others like her, in these lands as
they struggled to live on the remains of fading sugar empires. Then I asked her

permission to speak in her voice, and What to Tell a Child About the Surrender came to

life.
