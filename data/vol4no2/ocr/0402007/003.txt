the sky and the trees and the things I did not understand about my body, which was
young and eager. But my grandmother was a poem, waiting to be written.

When she was a young woman of 18 years of age, Mam chose to stay at the bed
of her sick father while her mother, Annie, left the natal province, St. Kitts, and moved to
a estate, possibly LaGrange on the outskirts of the town of Frederiksted, St. Croix, which
together with St. Thomas and St. John comprised the then Danish West Indies. It was the
year 1915. This is recorded in the census of the Danish West Indies taken somewhere
before the transfer of the islands to the United States in 1917.

My history is the legacy of the Pedra Street house and of these matriarchs who
trampled the ground beneath them and moved about the dust as long they could in any
one place. My grandmother, Mam, commanded the house and the yard and everything
near it, except for Papa Bethel who played it safe and moved a yard away where he could
avoid her tongue.

She would gather up her skirt while surveying her property and set her eyes on a
fowl running free, and issue an indirect directive. “A da fowl dey we a go eat come
Sunday”. Loosely translated, that meant that a marked fowl which believed itself a free
being was simply our Sunday meal still standing on its own legs.

With Mam’s pronouncement, someone would have to chase that fowl, and catch
it, and break its neck, and bleed it on a clothesline, and pluck its feathers, and rip out its
entrails, so that she could take over with garlic and onion and cloves and thyme. This
was the world I was born into and loved. Although we had an outside toilet, no running
water, no electricity, we relied on a dignified past and a hopeful future, even if it required
a passage by sea or by air.

When I was eight, the world changed. My sister and I left my grandparents to live
with our parents who had followed in Annie’s footsteps, but this time to St. Thomas in
the United States Virgin Islands, several years earlier. It was complicated the decision to
move, although we had been in a tide of movement all along, we, who had been torn from
Africa, could never stay forever in St. Kitts, or in any single place again. My aunts had
gone to Curagao and Santo Domingo and Statia and England, any place with any rumor

of gold. My uncles and great uncles worked the sea, and created their lives from that
