on Pedra Street, for it was born in Fahie’s Estate and brought to Pedra Street by truck in
the 1940s when my mother, Iona Bethel Roach was a girl, learning how to skip rope, to
pick cotton, to plant pigeon peas.

She was born to a cane field laborer, my grandmother Elzeva, also known as
Mam, and a baker/farmer/ shopkeeper, my grandfather, George Austin Joseph Bethel,
who was still planting on the slopes of the mountain when I came to join their family. A
mountain ground, he called his plot, and I was pleased as a boy of five to be extensions of
his hands when he harvested watermelons, peanuts, corn, cucumbers, which he planted,
and guavas, mangoes, avocados, mamey apples, and mocka, which grew wild there.

That was when he was old. When Papa Bethel was young and had just arrived
from Dominica, he lived with my grandmother Elzeva on an estate called Sir Gillies in an
estate house which was built originally for slaves and later inhabited by the children of
slaves who continued in the tradition of their forebears, the harvesting of sugar.

The sugar fields were vast, and wages were low and lower still for cotton, which
they picked when sugar was out of season and dampened it in secret to give it weight.
But my grandmother still saved her pennies and ha-pennies--imagine a currency which
split its smallest member into two-- until she had enough to buy the Pedra Street house
and to bring it down upon the plot of land which belonged to her brother, Thomas
Guishard.

It was not long before the word was out that she had bought a house while still
living in the estate house and worse that she was now a landlord, collecting rent. The
family was then forced out of the Sir Gilles quarters and commanded to the halls of their
own habitation, about three miles away.

My grandmother was no stranger to movement, because her mother had moved
them with the estates, wherever there was work, until she could take it no longer and
fixed her eyes on St. Croix where it had been rumored that the Danish dollar was easier to
come by and went so much further than the shilling. So she had lived on Bourke’s estate,
and Fig Tree and Low Valley, until she was left to her own way, when her mother, my
great-grandmother Annie, left St. Kitts.

From my mother, I had long been told my grandmother’s story, and my great

grandmother’s story. It had all the makings of a poem, although I wrote then only about
