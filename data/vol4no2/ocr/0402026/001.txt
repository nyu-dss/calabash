an iron gavel

with a colonial agenda
smashes my fingers
canes my legs

and makes me stand
in the corner

wearing the dunce cap

it keeps insisting

my people and i

are inconsequential
we should be grateful
for being enslaving

its lessons

privilege

snow in the tropics
mozart over marley
and offers cucumber
sandwiches

as bribe

to discard patty
