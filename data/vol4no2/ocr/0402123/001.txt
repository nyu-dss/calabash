A DISCOVERY OF MANGOES

He brought me notice of a powercut,
left and returned
with two bags of mangoes.

In fourteen years living there
(it was my last summer)

I had not seen

mangoes on any tree.

As he loaded the fruit

onto his motorcycle

(he offered me none)

he scolded me

for not exploring my environment.
He said there was a ripening tree
on the adjoining property.

After contemplating

the public nature

of my employer’s mangoes,

I crossed the line

and found branches sagging
with the tree’s accomplishments,
and its abundance

scattered on the grass.

I left rejoicing

with a scandal-bag full,
and lamenting

so many summers

of missed fruit
