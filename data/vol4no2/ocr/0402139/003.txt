happened to me when I was about 20. Quite young. Realizing that I was a writer is
something that happened significantly after that. It took many years before I would write
on the immigration form where it said occupation; it took many years before I wrote
“writer.” It took a few books before I felt that that was a term that was applicable to me.
I think the impulse to want to be a writer came first. Now, a lot of the time when I go
through immigration, I just put teacher.

JACQUELINE: And the second question was about publishing: Was that a
difficult road for you, trying to get published?

PHILLIPS: I was lucky in that I had written and had plays produced in London
before I wrote the first novel. So when I sent the first novel in blind submission to a
publisher at least there was a little tiny bit of name recognition because I had a couple of
plays on, on kind of fringe theaters, not big major theatres, but small studio-type theaters,
so I think the publishers were reluctant to throw it immediately on to the rubbish pile. But
having said that and said, wonderful, they read it and said, well, we don’t think so but if
you can look at it again and make some changes. And I did and then they said if you
could look at it again. So it wasn’t any easy straightforward route. But I’m not kidding
myself that I was helped by the fact that I had written plays.

DOLACE: Your first two books were Caribbean based so to speak. Where did
that world spring from? I know you left St. Kitts when you were four months old. So
how did you become familiar with than world?

PHILLIPS: When I was 22 I went back to the Caribbean with my mother for the
first time. When she left with me when as a baby in the late 50’s she’d never been back.
We didn’t have any money growing up. We couldn’t afford to buy a plane ticket from
England back with her. And of course it was a big psychological, emotional and cultural
shock for me, having grown up in England. Having felt that I didn’t understand the flora
and fauna of this world. I had no idea what the trees were called, I had no ideas what the
flowers were called. I had never been in hot sunshine in December. Everything about
the place was alien to me, apart from the fact that, of course, I was born there. So, out of
an attempt to reconcile these huge ambiguities I realized that right in front of me was the
subject matter because they were countless numbers of people like me in New York, in

Toronto, in London, who also knew that they were Caribbean to some extent but actually
