(RE) ROOTED:
AN INTERVIEW WITH CARYL PHILLIPS

DOLACE MCLEAN: Caryl, why did you decide to give us this interview?
CARYL PHILLIPS: Well, because it had something to do with the Caribbean, in

some way was connected to the Caribbean. And, you were persistent.

DOLACE: The first question for you Caryl, is what defines a Caribbean writer?

PHILLIPS: It depends on who is defining a Caribbean writer. If you ask an
academic, they will give you one definition. If you ask a publisher they will give you
another definition. From my point of view as a writer if you have any kind of association
with the Caribbean by heritage, interest in the region, cultural politics in the region, [or
connection]by birth, then you are a Caribbean writer. It just seems to me that by your
heritage, by your interests and by your commitments. People discover the Caribbean and
an affiliation for the Caribbean at different stages of their lives. Edwidge Danticat’s
relationship to the Caribbean is different from Derek Walcott’s. But it certainly cannot
be to do with your address. What I write about and what label people choose to apply to
me, has absolutely nothing to do with me. I go into a bookstore, I don’t know where I
can look for my work in a bookstore. Whether to look under literature, Caribbean
literature, black literature, if they have a section ... I don’t know, I don’t know where to
look. Similarly with syllabuses, I get taught under post colonial, British, Caribbean,
global, so I wouldn’t define it. I have given up trying to define it.

DOLACE: So Caryl, what is your impetus behind what you do as a writer?
