consider them to be in the same either thematic or structural tradition of say, The Nature
of Blood, which is all over the place.

DOLACE: I think what happens is the kinds of characters who seem to leap out of
the different texts. That’s what seems to connect the texts, even if structurally they are
different or thematically, because I gather that there are the first two, and then the trilogy
is deals more with the black Atlantic and the horrors of slavery. The characters
themselves are speaking in all these various ways out of various places....

JACQUELINE: How to you feel personally about Cambridge and Rudy
Williams? They are such forceful characters. Does he resonate with you still,
Cambridge?

PHILLIPS: You have to remember that it’s been eighteen years since I wrote
those books. None of these characters resonate with me anymore.

DOLACE: So the characters insist themselves on you and then they are
discharged into the text and then you can move on?

PHILLIPS: Yes, because I would be walking around with fifty people in my head.
So between criticism and the books ... I don’t read what critics say anyway. When I am
a writer, I am a writer. When the book is published I am an author. The only
relationship that I have with the characters is when I give readings.

JACQUELINE: Do you ever re-read any of your books?

PHILLIPS: No. I have never re-read a book.

DOLACE: But your characters, you have to fall in love with some of them?

PHILLIPS: In terms of what you said about falling in love with some of your
characters, of course you do. But like falling in love in real life, sometimes you have to
move on. But that’s a good point, you do fall in love. Jane Austen is not an author I like
very much, but my favorite novel of hers is Mansfield Park because in the penultimate
chapter she slips up and addresses her character as “my Fanny’. That is the only time the
veneer ever was breached. Yet, I do know that she had to go on and write another novel.
So you do find that you are filled with hope, you really hope, that whatever you went
through as a writer in writing these characters that always the passion and the emotion
end up on the page. You hope, yes, you hope, because as writers you do not know for

sure,
