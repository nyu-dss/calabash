home. You are not American and you are certainly not African American. Whereas in
Britain because there wasn’t a viable discernible non-white population, apart from the
Pakistani and Indian population, you were it. So, you were always going to stand out.
So it was a strange, a different type of upbringing and it wasn’t always comfortable and I
often tease my mother about it to this day: I say why didn’t we know more? Why didn’t
you say more? And in her defense she always says, I didn’t want to confuse you.

DOLACE: What was it like growing up in North England knowing that your roots
were somewhere else?

PHILLIPS: You grew up with tremendous difficulty. I mean, it was not always
comfortable. Because, like a lot of Caribbean people, you had access to two modes of
communication. Two modes of living. You live one kind of discourse at school where

of my brother’s is a psychotherapist who specializes in dealing with mental problems in
the black community in Britain, and some people did not learn to run and suffered
problems of mental health. Problems of break downs of all sorts. So, if you lucky you
survive with a bit of humor and seeing the nonsense of it; and if you weren’t so lucky you
got really angry and really pissed off.

JACQUELINE: Do you think things have changed any for blacks growing up in
England today?

PHILLIPS: Yes, my niece is sixteen today and she lives in an entirely different
world than I did. I spoke to her this morning and the way she carries herself, the way she

goes about her business at school, it is a much more confident sense of her entitlement to
