DOLACE: The image I am getting of you as an author is that you are like a
medium -- a medium communicating between two worlds.

PHILLIPS: I am not quite that spiritual enough to say that, but at the time when I
am writing I do need to clear space, to use your image, your metaphor of a medium, to
receive new people. To receive new stories. You have to clear space and move on to the

page, with drama you really need an actor. An actor can improve that character, can
clarify that character, can make you think. That’s why I say it’s more fun, but can also be

more frustrating because you find yourself having to scramble back at your desk because
