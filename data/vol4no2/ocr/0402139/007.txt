participate in British life than my generation. We were always: What did you say? Oh,
yeah? She doesn’t have that kind of nervous anxiety which I think that a lot of my
generation felt. The way that people of my generation dealt with it was through books,
some became activists. When I look at my niece she comes across as someone who has
been called a nigger and will be called a nigger but has a more witty response to that than
I would ever have.

DOLACE: So then, when you went back to St. Kitts at 22 how did it help to shape
your identity?

PHILLIPS: Going back meant that I had to understand, not sweep under the
carpet, but I had to understand who I was and that meant that I had to understand the
Caribbean. All four of my grandparents were born on this small island which is 12 miles
long by 6 miles wide. All four of them were born there and I was born there. All their
anxieties, which they took on the ship with them to England, both of my parents, came
from having grown up in this place. They first met and decided to get married there.
They first thought of having a child, me, in St. Kitts. They had me in St. Kitts and then
they decided to come to England. So this whole part of my history is there. So I could
no longer think of myself, not that I ever had done, it would be a fantasy to think of
myself as a British child. It made me much more interested in the Caribbean.

DOLACE: Did going back engender a more fractured kind of consciousness in
relation to England?

PHILLIPS: Hindsight is always 20/20. You look back and you see how you got
over, but I wasn’t thinking that strategically. I was thinking about making sure that every
penny I earned, every chance I got, I got on a plane and I came back to St. Kitts. I was in
St. Kitts in the early 80’s I was there all the damn time. One of my brothers was working
there. Was an engineer there. My girlfriend then, she was a lawyer in St. Kitts and so
most of the 80’s I was in St. Kitts. I bought land there as early as 1981 because I was
determined to have some kind of St. Kitts identity. I certainly wasn’t ever thinking of
living in America. My notion of what I was doing was making sure that I nurtured and
fed the Caribbean side of me. The British side of me was certainly taken care of, by
nature of upbringing. So my main thought was to nurture the Caribbean side of me. Not

in a selfless way, but because I knew it would help me as a writer as well.
