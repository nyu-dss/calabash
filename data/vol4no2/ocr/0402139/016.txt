until you see something in the rehearsal room it is not that clear to you. It is also not your
art more, because others share in that responsibility of realizing a play. It is essentially
the art form of the director. Theatre used to be the writers art form, people used to think
that way about a theater. People no longer think that way about theater. They think that
way about a book or a collection of poems.

JACQUELINE: Do you think play writing led you to fiction?

PHILLIPS: No. [always wanted to write fiction before I wrote plays.

DOLACE: What helped you to write fiction?

PHILLIPS: Reading. You read.

JACQUELINE: So Caryl, to wrap up: let’s say that our Calabash readers know
that we are going to be interviewing Caryl Phillips, so they say: Caryl tell us one book
that we should just curl up and read; who is it going to be?

PHILLIPS: Well, since this a Caribbean audience and a Caribbean readership,
they should read Derek Walcott’s poem, “The Light of the World.”

JACQUELINE: Great choice. With that we conclude and we thank you for the

interview.
