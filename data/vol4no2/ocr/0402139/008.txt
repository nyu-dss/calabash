JACQUELINE: So your first book that was published was Final Passage and
what were you trying to do in that novel?

PHILLIPS: I was trying to give the story of a lot of people whose story hadn’t
been told by people of my generation. Lamming had told the story of the immigrants,
Sam Selvon had told the story in The Lonely Londoners, so people of that generation had
said what happened to them when they came over on the ship. But the kids, none of the
kids had ever told the story of what happened to their parents? So I wanted to tell the
story, if you like, from my generation’s point of view. Try to recreate, reimagine that
journey.

JACQUELINE: It’s funny, because when I read Final Passage, I was reading The
Lonely Londoners at the same time, and I could see the connections. The book also
reminded me of Jean Rhys’s work in Wide Sargasso Sea in the absolute abandonment of
that female character at the end and the wish to return to the Caribbean at all costs.

PHILLIPS: I think you were probably seeing correctly. I mean, Jean Rhys was
somebody I was reading a lot in the early 80’s and deliberately so. I went to and stayed
at the hotels she stayed in deliberately in Paris ...the rootless, slightly dislocated person
all throughout her life.

JACQUELINE: The thing about that female character, though, in Final Passage,
she was so rootless in a certain kind of way. Probably it was wishful thinking, but she
never seemed to realize herself in that relationship and she just never...

DOLACE: ... seem to come into her own as a Caribbean woman or as a
woman...

PHILLIPS: Well, that’s because it maybe a different story if she had stayed in
England. What happened to a lot of Caribbean marriages is that you move from a largely
matriarchal society, which is the Caribbean, to an extremely patriarchal society, which is
Britain and something happens in that journey in terms of gender power shifting. So
many marriages mashed-up in Britain because the role that the women were to play in
Caribbean society she was not able to play that in British society because British society
is patriarchal. So a lot of strong women or potentially strong women found themselves

marooned in a society such as Britain.
