Morrison says, I don’t know about my characters until I hear a voice. That’s one way of
getting a character. Other people say, I know my character when I know exactly what
they would dress in ... how they would dress themselves in the morning. So, everybody
have a different way of getting close to their characters ... voice ... appearance ...
rhythm of speech, but nobody can tell you how to pluck them out of the air, because you
just don’t know.

JACQUELINE: Right, but what is your process like?

DOLACE: Yes, when do you know that this is a character for you?

PHILLIPS: It differs for me. Sometime it’s a voice, sometimes it’s their ability to

this is a character that is insisting a book upon you.

PHILLIPS: That is when I stop doing the other things that I am doing and buckle
down and get on with it. Actually, that is a very good word too, insist. Because they
start to make demands upon you. It’s no longer that you are squeezing in your writing

JACQUELINE: Because that is how it is for me.

PHILLIPS: And that is why I say insist is a good word and a good way of putting
it. But what is it that gets you to the point where you feel that insistence because
characters come by so many different routes.

JACQUELINE: No, I think you have answered the question, the characters begin
to insist themselves upon you.

PHILLIPS: No, I think you answered it! Like I say that word of yours insist is a
good word to use.

JACQUELINE: Because that is something we keep coming back to in Calabash
interviews, is how do you know that this is the one that will sustain a whole novel.

PHILLIPS: Well, because, sometimes you know you get it wrong. Sometimes

you begin thinking a particular novel is going to be about this person and as you are
