JACQUELINE: So I want to move on to talk a little bit about Higher Ground
because the structure was so radically different in that novel and I wondered what
accounted for that structure?

PHILLIPS: I think that in between the first two novels and Higher Ground, I
traveled for The European Tribe, which effectively spun me out of just the Caribbean. I
began to try to make connections between ... or I began to see connections between
various thematic impulses — loneliness, alienation, etc—that I came across time and time
again as I traveled across Europe. So when I sat down to write new fiction again after
that, I didn’t confident enough to just set something completely in Britain or completely
in the Caribbean. I basically wanted to do a bit of everything. And I also wanted to
formally and thematically do something different from the naturalistic novel.

JACQUELINE: Higher Ground was a clear break. Some of your characters
became larger than life. Rudy Williams, for example in the second section of Higher
Ground, and the character Cambridge in the novel of the same name. These characters
seem to almost be bursting at the seams for their own ...

DOLACE: Story; their own full text.

JACQUELINE: For me the first body of work is your first two novels, and the
other works are variations on a theme, perhaps because of The European Tribe? The
characters are so alienated. Do you see that?

PHILLIPS: No.

JACQUELINE: Do you see a break between the works before and After The

European Tribe? A progression?

PHILLIPS: I see the next book. I think both A Distant Shore and Dancing in the
Dark are both structurally and culturally rooted.

JACQUELINE: Well, I suppose there are three distinct progressions then.

PHILLIPS: You are saying that! Iam not saying anything! People should be very
wary about deconstructing their own work. That’s your job and that’s fine, and that’s
other people’s job. I would just say that when you say you see the first two novels and
then you see alienation well that is not structural alienation nor thematic alienation
because A Distant Shore is a very rooted English book and Dancing in the Dark is really

rooted in geography and time in the United States of America, so I don’t really don’t
