choice but to take you in. America doesn’t have to take me in. Britain doesn’t have to
take me in. But I feel that St. Kitts does.

JACQUELINE: When you were growing up in North England, wasn’t St. Kitts
brought into that landscape any at all?

PHILLIPS: Yes.

JACQUELINE: So why was the island so alien to you when you returned?

PHILLIPS: St. Kitts was brought in and discussed and obviously all the forms I
had to fill in I had to write down St. Kitts. But most first-generation migrant parents,
particularly to England at that period of time, were very careful because of the racism in
Britain and because the predominant cultural political mantra from the white community
was, “why don’t you go back to where you come from?” So my parents in common with

JACQUELINE: I guess that’s probably one of the differences with West Indians
in America. I was reading Audre Lorde and she was saying that her parents were very
keen for her to understand that America was not her home!

PHILLIPS: Precisely. But that’s also part, as I am sure you know, of the often
