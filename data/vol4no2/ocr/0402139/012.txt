writing it, another person begins speaking with a more declarative insistence. And that is
part of the weird mystery of this process.

JACQUELINE: And so what are they like for you, these characters: Are they real
people?

PHILLIPS: They are alive in my head. If they are not alive for me, then they are
not alive for the reader. But they have to live first in my head. And that is what all
fiction is, all writing is, it is all deeply imbued in one thing: hope. It’s your own personal
bag of fears transmuted into some form of literature for the reader. You hope that they
are feeling fearful for this character, you hope that they hope that this character gets over,
you hope that they are feeling equally frustrated that this character isn’t doing this or isn’t
doing that’s what storytelling should be, that magical moment where you think, for God’s
sake, do something about this situation! And conversely you are hoping that they are
thinking, this is a terrible situation and why can’t you see!

JACQUELINE: Well then Caryl I got caught up in the hope of the situation in
Final Passage. Its not a disengagement, its an engagement, where you get so caught up
in the character’s life that you just want to shake her and say, stop it!

PHILLIPS: But of course!

JACQUELINE: You can’t help it, you end up shouting to her: Do something!

PHILLIPS: Well that is what life is! That is what fiction is! I spent my whole life
reading. When you read Tess of the D’Ubervilles that’s what you think! You think, for
God’s sake, pull yourself together girl! When you read Madam Bovary, you thinking,
lady what are you playing at?

JACQUELINE: So do you ever get frustrated with some of your characters?

PHILLIPS: Of course!

DOLACE: Which characters most frustrate you?

PHILLIPS: No one individual comes to mind more than anybody else. All I will
say is that all of them to some extent, make you feel, that you wish they could look over
their shoulder and see what was coming. Or you wish they would look up ahead and
realize that the path that they was travelling on is going to get them in trouble. But that is
a human condition. People who live perilous lives surround us. And we can’t blame

them for that. I don’t judge my characters.
