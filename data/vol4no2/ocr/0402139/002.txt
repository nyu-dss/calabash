PHILLIPS: Well, you only write because you feel you have something to say.
You don’t have anything to say you shouldn’t bother writing because its too difficult. So
you write because ... the simplest definition of writing is that you have a story to tell and
you hope to be able to tell that story using the best words but you must have something to
say. I am not a writer because I feel that’s my job. I am a writer because I have
something to say.

DOLACE: So if you weren’t writing what else would you do?

PHILLIPS: I would maybe teach. I would maybe play my golf. Any number of
other things. There is nothing special about writing, it just happens to be my job, it
happens to be what I want to do, and it happens to be because I have something to say. If
I wake up one morning and I have no stories that are urgently pressing upon me, I hope I
have the common sense not to write and leave the storytelling to other people.

DOLACE: So this is a question we ask of other contexts of other Caribbean
writers: What if there were no commercial success? For example, what if someone were
to say, Caryl you might think you have a story to tell, but oh, well, I am not going to
publish you?

PHILLIPS: Every writer lives in fear of that happening. That one day they will
feel they have something urgent to say and that since this is a business the publishers may
decide, you may think this is urgent, and you may think its compelling but we don’t think
its particularly interesting or commercially viable. Who knows what you do at that
point? I don’t know what I would do. I don’t know if you try X number of other
publishers. If everybody said no, it would probably be a huge blow to the ego and to the
spirit and I don’t know whether one would continue in that situation. I do think though
that this is what a lot of people live in fear of, particularly in this current climate where
the literary fiction that one believes in is becoming increasingly backed into a corner with
a type of popular fiction that is on the ascendancy.

JACQUELINE BISHOP: I have two questions related to that: The first one is,
when did you realize you were a writer?

PHILLIPS: Well there are two things: One is realizing that you are a writer and

then there is realizing that you want to be a writer. Realizing that I want to be a writer
