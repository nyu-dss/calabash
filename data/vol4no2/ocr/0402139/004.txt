had no cultural point of reference with the place. That’s why my first books were
concerned with trying to write myself into the landscape. Passages of those books are
very descriptive of just landscape because I was trying to understand how to describe the
landscape. I could describe the English countryside quite well, because that’s what I had
seen all my life. But I needed to be able to describe this, because, this was a part of me.
Even if I did not recognize it, people recognized me.

DOLACE: How so?

PHILLIPS: Because they are family. They knew. They remembered me. They
remembered the photographs that had been sent back. They were in frames on the
mantelpiece. I saw photographs of myself growing up in what seemed to me to be
strangers’ houses, because I did not know these aunts and these uncles, and then you

to or ever wished to — but it was absolutely impossible to deny that the Caribbean wasn’t

PHILLIPS: Ah, home, is probably one of the more problematic words for
Caribbean people. You know Caribbean people have always had a multiple sense of
home. More so than any people in the world. I mean, here you are in a region of the
world where Africa met Europe on somebody else’s soil. To me for 400 years the notion
of home has been a problem for Caribbean people, whether you are in the Caribbean or
whether you are out of the Caribbean. I am no different. I feel we are in a city now, in
New York, which of course is the great city of rootlessness. I feel equally at home here
as I do when I was sitting in my house as I was a couple days ago in St. Kitts. The only
difference is, in a way; St. Kitts has no choice but to take me in. I was born there. The

poet Robert Frost says, home is the place where when you have to go there, they have no
