JACQUELINE: The thing that really fascinated me in those two first books, Final
Passages and A State of Independence, was in fact gender relations and gender politics
and I wanted to talk a little bit about that. I hear everything you are saying about British
society and how patriarchal it is, but that relationship in Final Passage was in serious
trouble even before she made the crossing to London. I was just having a hard time
trying to understand — I had seen it in real life — I was trying to understand how someone
would become attached to someone as detached as that man was? That was the part
where I was coming up highly frustrated.

DOLACE: Basically, you want to say Caryl why the woman didn’t just get the
hint and leave the man alone?

PHILLIPS: I have no answer to that. What do you want me to say? That’s the
book. That’s what happened. That’s the story. I am not writing gender politics here, this
is fiction. This is not some kind of thesis to fit in with somebody’s preconceived notion
of what constitutes character. This is just real life. In this novel, the woman throws
herself under a train in Anna Karenina. Presumably that’s not how you think women
should behave either.

JACQUELINE: Let’s move on to a State of Independence, and I guess that falls
under trying to write yourself into Caribbean literature again. I have to aADOLACEit that
was probably my favorite book of all the books, because, well, probably I could more
closely identify with that character. But I wanted you to talk a little bit about what it was
that that main character — I understand the title and the time that he came back — but what
was the independence suppose to be one or to?

PHILLIPS: That book might be your favorite but I don’t know if I can answer the
question. The independence ... obviously it is political independence that we are talking
about, also a notion of personal independence in terms of family. But to be honest, so
much water has passed under the bridge since then that I am not entirely sure that I can
give a properly cogent answer. But obviously there is some notion of independence, the
larger notion of political independence working against the idea that no man is an island.

You need your family; you need a certain rootedness.
