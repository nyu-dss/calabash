JACQUELINE: But with his mother, in some ways I am waiting for that
confrontation between him and his mother and she just disappears ... and he has just
return. What is he going to do after returning to this island?

PHILLIPS: I don’t know either. Presumably he thought he was going to fit in.

JACQUELINE: Do you think he is going to stay there ... do you think he is going
to stay on St. Kitts ... stay on the island now?

PHILLIPS: Wherever “the island” might be! The thing I remember most about
the end of that novel is the cable wires from America as a new form of colonialism
begins to take over. Whether I am going to stay, I am not sure. I think the idea is that he
wanted to stay, but whether he can stay, or whether he is basically now mortgaged with
these years of silence in England, mortgaged his ability to effectively communicate and
participate in his society, I think that is the suggestion.

JACQUELINE: I think with that what that novel did effectively was shift the
locus of power: it is no longer England people want to get to anymore, but America.
That’s correct, right?

PHILLIPS: Yes.

JACQUELINE: When you are writing, do you start from a character or an idea?

PHILLIPS: Characters, always! No novel begins with an idea, it won’t fly. It all
comes from character. Everything comes from character.

JACQUELINE: What’s that process like?

PHILLIPS: Painful.

DOLACE: How do you construct those characters?

PHILLIPS: If you knew how to do it, you would be writing many more books
than I do write. The reason why people like Michael Crichton or John Grisham can write
two or three books per year is because there are no characters. Its all plot based. Literary
fiction takes time. The gestation period for literary fiction is connected to character. If
any writer was able to tell you how to do that, they should put it in a bottle and sell it.
They would make a lot of money. You just don’t know. Characters appear to you, you
think, think, think. Characters will drive the book. You need to know the characters.
You need to understand them. It takes along time to understand them. I have no idea.

Not a clue. You are thinking about a particular subject and then a voice appears. Toni
