But despite

all her promises,
the old maiden
just can’t seem

to bring herself

to final curtain,

to take at last

the quiet fall.

She holds out

with purpose

for her regent,

for blessed Iona,
Bethel’s fair daughter
who came down
from blue sky

to be its first

and humble queen.

Once this province
was the kingdom
of all fabric,

a place of creation,
where wild organza
and garish madras
shared secrets

with voile and
simple cotton

and the extravagant
crepe de chine,
where elegant thread
and buttons born

in luminous shells
from sea bottom
each waited in turn
upon her grace.

The old house
bows down now,
this vacant palace
built on a patch

of volcanic ground
in the spread

of the lonely
jagged mountain
named for misery
