THE KINGDOM OF CLOTH

The old house
which conceals
from sunlight

a negligible portion
of an English acre
has waged battle
with every manner
of the elements,
and is ready to fall.
It makes promises
to the ground

on each good day
of a grand reunion
some morning soon.

It will be wondrous
that glad sunrise
when the resting
shall come to pass,
when wood, tinnen,
shingle and nail
shall crash down,
the final splendor
to long journey
where the earth
shall take them
just so that

they might return
to face in glory
another good life.
