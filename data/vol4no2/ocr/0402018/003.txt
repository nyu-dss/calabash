and with its shroud
made up of the fog
which did keep

its company

all the beautiful day
and every night,
while its queen
kept her reign

by lamplight.

Make haste Iona,
find your way

by Carib ocean,

to offer the kingdom
one final command.
The old house

it is long weary,

so much memory

a burden to keep.
Grant it now

your permission

for sunlight

again to warm

the hidden ground,
for green grass

to come again,

for earth to prosper
with the worth

of the cleansing rain.
