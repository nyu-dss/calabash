5 YEARS LATER

I am living in hell

but stepping on clouds

where everyman’s heaven

is the Kingdom’s lower level.

Up here the leaves, tumbling to earth
whisper goodbye in jaded streaks
and Jesus is our brother

calloused and soiled

by the side of the road

where bougainvillea stoop

tending his wound.

This is hell, the red prison pulsing
through my limbs, the years
falling too as everything falls
against the emerald me, still new
still pushing up dirt

with shouldered leaves.
