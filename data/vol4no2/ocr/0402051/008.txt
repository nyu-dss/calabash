Flossie rose slowly from her bed and led the husband into the birthing room. She
expected that at the sounds of the voices from the bedroom next door, the girl would begin to stir
and when they entered the room, she was not surprised that the new mother was almost alert.
“Where is the baby?” Even in her weary state Flossie could detect the difference in the enquiries
by husband and wife. The girl’s question was quiet, tentative, apprehensive. The husband’s was
assertive, demanding, confident.

Flossie went over to the girl and placed her arm around her trembling shoulders. “Your
beautiful baby is over there,” she said and pointed, hesitantly, to the second box.

She felt a wave of nausea come over her as the husband walked toward the box. She left
the room and walked weakly to her bed. She lay back on the bed and closed her eyes and
prayed. And suddenly while the rain and the winds raged outside, she experienced a strange and
spiritual energy, as she heard clearly, above the tumult of the storm, unrestrained peals of
laughter and merriment from the birthing room, an expression of happiness that she imagined by
some mysterious hand would escape the house and rise beyond the swaying tree tops, past the
onrushing winds and rain, upwards into the heavens and on to the smiling, forgiving and
approving face of God.

And then she fell asleep.
