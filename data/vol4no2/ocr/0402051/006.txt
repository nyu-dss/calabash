And now, so soon after those vows of for better or for worse, how could things have
come to this? How could educated people in these times prefer one sex over another in a child?
And what did these new fangled machines know anyway? Couldn’t they make mistakes? And
why would anyone want to know the sex of a child before birth? Wasn’t 'not-knowing' a great
part of the thrill of childbirth? And if these machines turn out to be accurate, what is the next
step, killing all the unwanted girls? Flossie prayed, and as she prayed, a glimmer of hope
illumined her consciousness. She had heard rumors that recently Europeans and Americans
sometimes came to the island to seek children for adoption with the assistance and approval of
the Government. Over the years she had heard all kinds of rumors, but always her hopes of help
had been dashed, and she had had to carry on the best she could. Perhaps, now, desperate and in
failing health, she could ask Mr. George to use his position and influence to look into the matter.
He was a good man and he had made a public promise of assistance. She would get a message to
him in the city as soon as she could. He would help with her babies.

As she lay restless in bed, rain began to fall with gradually increasing intensity. She knew
that on this small island the weather was uniform and that it was raining throughout the island.
She wished that these rains could be showers of blessings that would cleanse and fertilize, would
wash away the evil and unhappiness in the world, would bring love and affection and desire to
all the children of the world, boy and girl alike. She prayed again for God’s blessings and for
peace and rest and forgiveness.

Above the steady drumming of the rain Flossie heard a shout and went to the window that
looked onto the path to her house. She noticed two figures in the distance, approaching
hurriedly. A man was holding a woman around the waist and shouting, Miss Flossie, Miss
Flossie, help!”

As they got nearer, Flossie recognized the girl and her cousin who lived in the village. She
opened the front door and they entered wet and excited.

“She ready to have baby,” the man said. “Her husband not home so I bring her but I

going back to wait for him till he get home.”
