among the flowers and a humming bird hovered on a desert rose, its iridescent green contrasting
against the delicate pink color and crimson outer edge of the flower. A lizard darted nonchalantly
among the greenery, its hen-pecked tail partly re-grown, oblivious of the chicken lurking
expectantly nearby. Caterpillars, fat and healthy, nibbled on the leaves of shrubs.

She leaned back in the chair, bible in her lap, and closed her eyes and her thoughts drifted
away to the past. She remembered her childhood, the hardships and the poverty, several siblings
dying in infancy for lack of money and medical care. She was smart and did well in school but
opportunities for substantial work were limited at that time, especially for women. She had been
jilted in a relationship and had never married or had children of her own. She went into
midwifery and savored the rewarding experience. She felt great pride in the successes of her
abandoned charges: doctors, attorneys, and civil servants among them. If there was an
occasional miscreant, she consoled herself that one could not expect a hundred percent success
and good or bad, all were God’s children. Now she was getting weak, and exertion brought on a
shortness of breath. She was not one to visit doctors but a grateful villager had persuaded her to
do so and had himself taken her to a doctor who had diagnosed progressive heart failure. How
long, she wondered, could she carry on her work? Who would take over her work? What had
become of the world? Children not wanted...Girls not wanted...Didn’t people realize that all
children are God’s children? Just two days ago a young girl had come to her in tears, ready to
deliver, and had asked her not to let her see her baby, to keep it and care for it...And she a dying
woman.

Flossie thought how similar these two young women were. They were both young and
could be sisters, both desperate and unhappy. One wanted no child; the other wanted no girl.
Flossie read several chapters of her bible, closed it and placed it gently on the floor beside her,
and then rested for several minutes, rocking gently in the rocking chair, lulled temporarily by the

rhythmic creaking of the wooden floor.
