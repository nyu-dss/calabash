She arose slowly and walked towards the back room of the house. This was the
birthing room, clean and orderly. There was a bed and a table with a basin. On another
table there were three rectangular wooden boxes. They had been constructed and donated
by a carpenter, a former protégé, as a gift to replace decrepit cardboard boxes. They were
arranged in a row and lined with blankets. The first two held sleeping babies, a girl in the
first and a boy in the second. She bent over the babies and kissed each one gently on the
forehead. “Sweet things,” she said.

She went to her bedroom just off the birthing room and lay, weary, on her bed. She knew
she was a dying woman. The doctor had intimated as much although he had not predicted a
time. But she could feel the increasing difficulty in breathing and she knew the end could not be
far. She was not afraid of death. She was at peace with God and prepared to meet her maker.
She tried to sleep but she could not get the young girl out of her mind. How unhappy she was,
this child whom she herself had delivered, it seemed, just yesterday.

She recalled how happy the girl had been at her wedding barely over a year ago and what
a beautiful bride she had been. Her husband was a prosperous businessman and by all accounts
seemed to love her sincerely, Flossie thought. As she witnessed the ceremony as an honored
guest, he seemed somewhat stern, but businessmen must be business-like and beneath that stern
exterior Flossie sensed a fatherly protective love and devotion. He had the means and spirit to
care for this young girl and they would surely stay together till death did them part.

The wedding was an elaborate affair, a great diversion and entertainment for the
community, with lots of food and drink and music and the church gaily decorated. She
remembered some unkind comments from some onlookers. There had been gossip regarding the
age differences.

“What a way that old man love young stuff.”
“Boy, she so tiny, he not ‘fraid she break when he jook she.”
“Chuh, man, you never hear the closer to the bone the sweeter the meat.” Lots of laughter

and giggles silenced by Flossie’s stern and disapproving stare followed by sheepish apologies.
