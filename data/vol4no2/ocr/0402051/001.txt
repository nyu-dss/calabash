AN ACCEPTED CHILD

“Don’ believe them things,” Flossie said. It was at once a statement and an admonition.
She gazed at the young girl sitting across from her at the old wooden kitchen table.

“But that is science,” the girl said. “How can you not believe it? How can I not believe
it?” Tears trickled onto her face and there was distress and desperation in her voice.

Miss Flossie, as she was known to everyone in the small tropical village, was an old
woman in her eighties, small, thin and frail. She was the village midwife and had been
performing this duty for almost sixty years. She had delivered almost all of the young people in
the village, not to mention many of their mothers and fathers, and had in fact delivered the young
girl sitting before her. She was an unofficial one-woman social service and adoption agency,
keeping the babies who had been abandoned by scared, desperate mothers, and either raising
them herself with the help of the villagers, or sometimes a well-to-do, childless family would
take an abandoned child as its own. During the bloody civil war that followed independence, she
was an icon to both sides, protected and respected, and both factions threatened dire penalties to
any one who would harm a hair of her head. After the war ended and order was established, she
had been honored by the Government for her valuable services and been all the more thrilled at
the honor because the presenter of the award, Mr. George, was one of her abandoned babies who
had made good. He had given a memorable speech and from time to time she would recall his

words.
