He left and Flossie took the girl into the birthing room. She removed her wet clothes, put
on a dry nightgown and laid her on the bed. The labor pains were coming more frequently.
Flossie put a pot of water on a coal fire and while the water heated she attended to the girl,
calming her fears and anxiety.

Flossie poured the hot water into the basin, took some clean towels and placed them on
the table beside the bed where the girl was lying. The contractions came more frequently and the
girl screamed with each one. Flossie knew that as a first pregnancy, labor would be prolonged
and difficult. She was prepared but she was feeling weary. During the long labor, the girl
became exhausted and lapsed into semi-consciousness. In this state Flossie delivered the baby.
She cleansed it, wrapped it in a towel and placed it in the third box. Exhausted herself and with
the new mother asleep from her travail, Flossie went to the next room to her bed.

The rains continued steadily, drumming on the metal roof, and pouring from the gutters
into the rain barrel at the corner of the house. Flossie tried to sleep but despite her exhaustion and
weariness she could not sleep. A kind of nervousness enveloped her. She felt uneasy. “God
forgive us sinners,” she prayed.

A knock on the door startled her.

“Miss Flossie, let me in!” She recognized the voice of the girl’s husband. She opened
the door and he entered. He was agitated and loud. He removed his dripping raincoat and threw
it on a chair.

“Quiet, man,” Flossie scolded, “she exhausted and sleeping. Everything is OK.”

“Where is my son?” he demanded. “I want to see my son!”

Flossie walked slowly back to her bed and sat on the edge. She felt breathless and light-
headed and the room seemed to be swaying.

“T so tired,” she said. “Lord, have mercy.”

“T thank you for everything, Miss Flossie and I can see you tired. Just show me the baby

and then you can rest.”
