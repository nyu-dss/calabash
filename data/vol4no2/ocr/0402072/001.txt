MEN IN ROBES

i've spent many lonely nights crying
many lonely nights in tears
trouble like water under the bridge

telling me things that I don’t wish to know

the caroni river overflows

and traffic is piled up for hours

just like these emotions inside my head
just like these emotions inside my head

the church says don’t do this it’s wrong
the church says don’t do that it’s wrong
and the church says don’t you dare
love your own reflection

men in robes telling me what to do
men in robes telling me who to love
and how do I choose

living in a Christian world

when it’s you that keeps me sane

when night falls

you that keeps me safe

when all else fails

if I shatter this reflection they’ll win
tired of writing loves notes in the fire
tired of reading ashes in the dawn

i hear hypocrisy has a new name in town
tell me something father

what is it you tell those little boys

do you tell them to climb

the staircase to your heaven
