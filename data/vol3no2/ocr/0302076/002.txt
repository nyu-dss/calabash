institutional expectations of politically correct behavior. The plot unfolds in a non-linear
way: it goes back and forth within the memories of the main character, Ivanoskar, who is
also the narrator. The story begins at the hospital located in San Juan de Puerto Rico right
after Ivanoskar’s mother died. The way he reacts to his mother’s death is mentioned in
the first sentence of the novel: “Cuando me enteré de la muerte de mama no pude
contener la risa.” Ivanoskar cannot retain his laughter when he knew of his mother’s
death.

Readers are taken into the inner world of the main character and discover how he
used to interact with his mother as an adolescent and as a young adult. The mother/son
relationship is so possessive and absorbing that after the mother’s death the bond survives
and Ivanoskar cannot escape from it. In order to keep his mother forever, he decides to
rob the dead body from the hospital and to bring it back to the family house where,
according to Ivanoskar, the mother can get the funeral she deserves. Everything is done
with the complicity of Migueleli one of Ivanoskar’s brothers. He seduces the nurses’
supervisor, has sex with her and gets her help to rob the body.

At the end of the novel, readers’expectations are shattered when Ivanoskar’s
possessive love for his mother leads him to devour her literally. Ivanoskar invites his
brothers to a very special banquet: the dead body, previously cut with a saw, is exposed
on the table and, with a spoon, he starts eating one of his mother’s eye. Even though he
knows he is doing something that is taboo, Ivanoskar must go as far he can to continue
the possessive link with his mother beyond death. His desire to eat the body of the
woman who gave him birth and fed him, leads to transgression and creates a universe
where hallucinations become his pregnant reality.

In this hallucinatory space where images fade into each other like dreams, animals
play an important role. Animals first appear on the second page of the novel and then at
specific moments of the story. Dogs and horses punctuate the text according to the
unbridled senses of the narrator. They function as figures that support the intensification
of all five senses and open the doors to a world in which it is possible to interlace any
kind of perceptions whether visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile or related to taste:

La jauria de los galgos rusos, de los galgos ingleses silenciosos, mondtonos como

sombras, jorobados sobre su propio peso, me deslumbraba. Verlos pasar como
