by the death of the mother. For the narrator, giving voice to his thoughts through writing
has a therapeutic effect. Writing makes possible the transfer of and the transformation
from frightening and unarticulated emotions to a symbolic enunciation. In this respect
the animals are the guardians of an inner territory that needs healing, animals that writing
will eventually transform into a piece of literary art, comparable only with a divine
creation of the self.

There is a tragic dimension in La Muerte de Mama that comes from the power of
desire and the risk of following it in spite of the obstacles and the prohibitions. The final
scene of the novel destroys taboos when it approaches incest in an unusual and powerful
way. The death of the mother provides the opportunity for Silén to explore an explosive
and subversive experience when a character becomes unusually familiar with the dead
body of his mother in a monstrous act of love. Silén identifies himself as a “neomistico”
writer who sees the love of God as the most revolutionary power in the world. It is this
complex interweaving of his religion with his political identity that makes Silén’s writing
unique among the production of contemporary Latin American writers. It is also the
impetus behind his art, imbued with the same power as desire and unleashing the

powerful emotions that transform his writing into that artistic creation we call literature.
