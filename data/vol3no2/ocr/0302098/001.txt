STILL HERE

I am still here. And so are you if you’re reading this bit of writing, still here, to
breathe, and smile and laugh and cry and engage in interesting or dull conversations if
you so choose (ain’t life beautiful). But the truth is thousands, dare I say millions of
women are not here today. Their lives have been snuffed out by someone who didn’t love
them, who thought that they would play God and declare that they should no longer live

and and who carried out the act to ensure that their words became a reality.

Yesterday, a woman walked off of a bus that she rode with her daughters. She
was shot to death in her chest. Her life slipped away from her. It could no longer remain.
I imagine that moment in my mind. Slow motion. I imagine that she walks normally to
the exit door of the jitney, her daughters, 15 and 9 in tow. And as she takes her first step
outside, boom, like a firecracker on New Year’s Day. And then another boom, the bullet
penetrates the thigh of the 15 year-old daughter. No beautiful lights fill the sky. The
woman falls to the dusty ground, feeling afraid as a rush of sudden pain explodes in her
chest. She falls face up. She looks at her daughters as they scream for her, for themselves.
She knows that she is leaving. She tries to hold on I'm sure. She wants to be there to see
her daughters grow up to be honorable ladies, with lives filled with happiness and peace,
something that may have eluded her life. I imagine that she had a brief flash to when she

was little, and maybe she thought briefly of a happier time. Maybe. And then nothing.
