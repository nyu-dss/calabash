I’m tired of this. I’m tired of women dying because a coward dwells in the
shadows of life. I am tired of children being left motherless. I am tired of hearing the
stories. And not because I have become hardened and no longer wish to listen, no, I just
don’t want any more women to suffer and die at the hands of abusive partners, ex or

current ones. I am tired of women feeling afraid and powerless.

When I was little I grew up in an abusive family. My father issued threats against
my mother many times. Fear gripped my life like a glove. I wore it well, as I tried to live
a life that appeared drenched in normalcy. My life wasn’t normal. Some days I didn’t
know if I would see my mother again after I came home from school. Some days I didn’t
eat. I couldn’t. Fear. Sometimes I would sleep with a knife under my pillow. I was
prepared to fight if the need to do so arose. I was prepared. I always wondered if my
family was the only one who experienced the oppression that my family did, at the hands

of my father. I always thought that I was the only one. But I wasn’t. I never was.

Today, I walk in forgiveness everyday when I relate to my father. Because hate is
a bitch, and who needs that? Heck just last week I went to the A&E with him, and
wouldn’t you know, two women came in there after being attacked by their partners. The

looks in their eyes seemed too familiar.

As an adult, some who know me might be shocked if they found out that I lived
such a life once. But abuse doesn’t have any pre-requisite looks. Abuse takes place in the
home of the pauper and the rich. Many women go to bed with swollen eyes and broken
ribs. Or maybe they are told the most horrific words that compound into an emotional

punch that leaves their spirit broken.

Today I cried for that woman and last night I had a dream. I dreamed that a
woman screamed, “No one cares about women who get abused!” In my dream I cried
too. Today when I cried, I cried for the lady who died yesterday. I cried for every woman
who is currently in an abusive relationship, and who doesn’t see a way out. I cried for

every woman who just doesn’t see...her worth.
