KENDAL KRASH - 1957"

Imagine that September night when the news flashed
to the tenement yard on Sunlight Street

that the excursion train had crashed:

when the man broke down and wept

for his sister torn from her seat

as the song died in her mouth. Imagine

How the tree trunk yielded to the wild burst,
and the door clanged

as the train ploughed into the yam field
near the sleeping town of Kendal; imagine
the priest and pickpocket lending a hand

to someone as the carriage caved in

and the hour sucked the oil from the lamp,
