The instant when the train plunged

like a blunt machete through the damp clay

of a moonlit field and the cows broke

into a dismayed gallop,

while rich and poor alike were thrust into the texts
of one another’s lives,

jam-packed, trying to hang on

between this world and the next.

Now, year after year, as if to fill

some vacant outpost left by the chill,

the stories clamber back, of the Kendal Ghost
emerging from the stricken stream

to hitchhike into town (or so they say)

then disappear, as in a dream

of morning mist when time came to pay.

 

“The 1957Kendal train crash was the worst rail disaster in Jamaica’s history and the second wors in the
world at that time
