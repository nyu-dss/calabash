and about the crammed tuck shop, and the crowd outside
with the early morning St. Catherine’s mist clearing—
those mornings that started off with the mist

sitting on silent haunches over the Rio Grande,

then drifting like a ghost through the Bog Walk gorge
and over the fields, and the rusting railroad tracks,

while the sun waited out of sight.

She talked, I listened; and I imagined the cancer

she told me about in passing listened too.

We talked about everything except her approaching death:
About walking to school between the orange groves,

our rain hats sweating dew and the mist

creeping into the English classroom,

shrouding Silas Marner’s hermetic life—

how he crouched from those blows to the heart

behind the bag of gold he hoarded while weaving cloth!

Always there was the mist, barely touching what it touched,
each day renewed, each day lingering

as though hoping to be invited in,

dissolving beyond the football field like time itself,
withdrawing like a memory that cannot be traced.

Descending from out of nowhere, it locked us in time,
