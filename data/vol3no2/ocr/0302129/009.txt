Grenada until the British ultimately regained control. Johnn’s painting, Fedon Rebellion,
is one piece that deals with this episode in Grenadian history. The painting shows Julien
Fedon, ex-slave-cum-revolutionary, on his signature white stallion horse, in full French
regalia, hauling Nnian Home, the defeated Governor, home to his Bellevedere Estate to
be tried and executed. There is also another work dealing with the Caribs' last stand on
Grenada. In the painting, the French are on horses charging towards fleeing Caribs at
Leapers Hill, the place where legend has it that the Caribs sprang to their deaths in the
rough sea, rather than surrender to the French in 1651.

Events of historical significance permeate John’s work but there are other aspects
of Grenada that are there. There is the Grenada that is serene and natural, as in a solitary
boy indolently fishing in the serenity of a pretty Grenadian river. John paints fruit in wild
and carefree colors that are palpable and tinged with emotion. Johnn’s work seems to
have an exilic, longing quality, often associated with Caribbean artists who work outside
of the region. His work is also both a recasting and a re-telling of “heroic” aspects of
Grenadian history, from the point of view of a native Grenadian son.

It is in an artist like John that viewers get a blend of the counter-cultural
aestheticism of Benjamin coupled with the intuitive magical realism of Calliste. All three
painters transmit the depth of feelings that define the character of Grenada and her
surrounding isles. They share their tropical haven, beset with its own set of growing
pains, abounding in color and unrestrained in its desire to make viewers love Grenada

just a little bit more.
