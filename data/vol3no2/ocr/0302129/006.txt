politically prominent figures to support the movement of Grenada to produce a local
national art that was just as good as, if not better than, the colonial legacy of art that
characterized Grenadian culture. Benjamin’s art contributed to the burgeoning cultural
identity that sprang from agitation for political independence from Britain. His work
spoke to a whole new generation who struggled to re-make Grenadian society.

Although he is classically trained, Benjamin does not do classical pieces of still-
lifes and landscapes. He paints the human form in circular shapes that resemble human
figures clad in padded costumes of various different colors. The carnivalesque quality of
many of his images is aided by the swirling movement in the forms depicted on a large
canvas or hardboard. His work is often done in watercolors so that the figures appear to
almost melt into each other. The use of the circle empowers his works and makes it seem
as if his subjects are constantly in motion. His work references the surreal but is often
void of three-dimensional form, except for his detailed depictions of the nutmeg as one of
the sensory organs of his human forms, usually the eyes. Benjamin has been for years,
quite prominent within the carnival circles in Grenada, especially in his hometown of
Grenville. Notably, Grenville is also home to one of the larger nutmeg processing plants
in Grenada so it is little wonder that the image of nutmeg pervades Benjamin’s visions.

Benjamin uses the nutmeg as a kind of allegorical expression in Grenada's visual
art. He paints the nutmeg with pride to emphasize the legacy that Grenada has as one of
the top producers and exporters of the crop. One of his paintings is a portrait of teaching
colleague and friend with bulging, oval eyes in the shape of nutmegs. Even the head of
the man has the oval nutmeg form. The tone of the man’s skin is bluish-black with a
glossy effect that references the dark outlayer of the nutmeg that glows in the Grenadian

sun. The nutmeg is endemic to Grenadian society since it provides one of the largest
