life there is hard. Many Carriacouans earn a living by fishing or farming. Carriacou is an
island still steeped in the ancestral African practices of drumming and storytelling that
must have been common to Calliste during his early years; practices that must have had
an enduring influence upon his psyche. The Big Drum, Maroon and Saraca festivals are
all part of the legacy brought to Carriacou from the continent with the enslaved people
who once worked the sugar and cotton plantations. These festivities are associated with
planting and harvesting and continue to influence life on Carriacou to the present.

Inspired by an enchanted and elusive mermaid when he was only seven years old,
Calliste’s work pays homage to the mermaid in paintings laden with the raw emotions
and experiences of everyday life as he sees it around him and reproduces it in his art. As
the story goes, Calliste was a little boy when he saw a mermaid rising from the waters
who told him that he had to become a painter. Fortunately for the art world, Calliste
heeded the mermaid’s instructions. Coming from the post-slavery era Calliste’s vision of
his native Carriacou could not have been glamorous. The work attempts to portray the
islands’ realism, as opposed to indulging a sophisticated aestheticism. The irony
surrounding such a portrayal, however, is that what is “factual” about Calliste, and many
of his paintings, is suffused with the mythical and the folkloric.

On the island of Carriacou, legends and folk tales abound and they include many
that mention the mermaid. In many ways, the mermaid fits in perfectly in West Indian
folklore because she is a creature of water. The mermaid also poses a question -- a
question of belonging — for where exactly is the “home” of this part-human, part-fish
creature? Africans migrated to the Caribbean on water as captive slaves and the sea still
roils with the spirits of those who did not survive the ordeal of the middle passage. In

one of Calliste’s paintings there are black birds hovering over the beleaguered waters of
