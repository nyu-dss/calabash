the Kick-em-Jenny cone of islands situated between Carriacou and Grenada. The water is
said to contain volcanic mobility and the sea is always rough. In the painting, the birds
look like vultures, devouring the very “flesh” of the ocean. It is a scene of horror in
which even a sea captain trembles at the thought of navigating through the restive souls
that seem to trouble the waters of Kick-em-Jenny.

Calliste’s work defines a living culture based on daily toil, dream, myth, pain and
above all survival. He is a man who is a master of other art forms. A player of the banjo

Jamaican, Linton. J. Riggs, and held annually during the Emancipation weekend. Calliste
is also habourmaster, gardener and the proud father of dozens of children in the village of
L'Esterre, Carriacou. To translate the spirit of the folk and their lore into artistic
representation, Calliste paints on found materials -- cardboard boxes are his canvases --
that come from the raw materials of the life of the Carriacouan people. Using his
cardboard cut outs primed with white paint, Calliste paints directly off the tube, giving
his work an opaque and matte effect.

beauty of the people of Carriacou in their natural state as hard-workers who must make

sense of life on a hard, but sunny isle where they struggle to survive. It is this inspired
