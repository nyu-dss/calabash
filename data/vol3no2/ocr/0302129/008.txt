personal life experiences in Grenada and the United States have influenced him to use his
art as a vehicle to expose Grenada to the wider world.

His youth in Grenada was influenced by the political upheavals there in the 1970s
and 1980s and some of his paintings reflect the times and events. In 1979, England-
trained lawyer and native Grenadian, Maurice Bishop and his New Jewel Movement led a
coup d’état and took power of the government. Four years later there was serious schism
within the New Jewel Party that led to Bishop’s assassination. The United States military
intervened in 1983, and an Intertm Advisory Council ruled Grenada until the constitution
and parliamentary government were restored in December 1984. Johnn depicts scenes
from the invasion by the United States Marines when he paints marines jumping off a
United States carrier into the Grenada Ocean. In another painting Johnn depicts cricketers
fighting off United States marines on their playing field.

Many of John’s other paintings reflect the patriotic spirit of the Grenadian people
for the love of their land against foreign invaders. The first invader was Christopher
Columbus who sighted Grenada in 1498 and was prevented from colonizing the Island by
the indigenous Carib Indians. The island was a site of contention between the English
and the French until 1650 when the French managed to settle the Island. Grenada
remained in French hands until 1762 when the British successfully invaded the island
during the Seven Year’s War. The French recaptured the island in 1779 but the British
finally acquired Grenada by the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Despite the island's long history
of British rule, the island's French heritage survives in its place names, its buildings, and
its strong Catholicism

In 1795, British rule was challenged by Julien Fedon, a black planter inspired by

the French Revolution. Fedon led the island's slaves on a rebellion to take control of
