draft summary recognized that societies in crisis (SIC) cannot be solved without
the immediate global implementation of arts education, inside and outside of the
school curriculum to prepare our children and our young people to take their
place in global society without losing their sense of individuality and cultural
heritage.

It was recommended that the creative arts be implemented throughout the
education system as a positive alternative activity, in collaboration with artists
and arts-trained teachers, a position on which many artists, teachers and parents
agreed. Used as an interdisciplinary approach, creative arts education develops
taste, care and respect for differences in culture and artistic works students will
come into contact with, broadens their possibilities of expression and
communication, which will be used to effect enormous political and social
changes, imperative for the development of a nation’s human resource.

Ms Tracie Rogers, the ARD consultant who arranged for the group to do this
presentation, presented a paper entitled “De Day we See Wind, Playback Theatre
in Grenada” during the panel on Arts in Social Therapy. The paper touched on
the positive benefits that the’therapy” that expressive arts have had on the
members of the Grenadian community who have interacted with the group.
Incidentally, the draft summary from the conference recommends that the
Grenada Playback Theatre be recognized internationally as a UNESCO ‘Best
Practice’.

Hollis Liverpool, PhD, aka Chalkdust gave a resounding call for the involved
use of the expressive arts to counter the rising tide of what ails the islands of the

Caribbean and the wider world — societal ambivalence, violence and disharmony
