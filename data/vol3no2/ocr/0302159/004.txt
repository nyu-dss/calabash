and to better communicate what they feel with their peers and teachers. Of
course this skill is only truly effective in an environment that suspends judgment
and listens openly. And at a time when our cultural gods die — when Anansi is
replaced by Sponge Bob, Mr. Bully indicated that the Caribbean as the first
pluralistic society has no alternative but to turn to our arts for survival in this
globalize environment. Our arts and our society are inseparable outgrowths of
each other.

Several panelists bemoaned the lack of ‘elder practice’, leading to a crisis
of inheritance, where, in this post-independence era, we still lack cultural spaces
dedicated to the arts; where we are still without legislation or a national arts
policy, where we forget that our people and their resources are our capital. The
consensus of the symposium was that arts education makes it possible to grasp
the abilities that make the understanding and transformation of the realities of
imagination, creativity and criticism, possible. Our artists, our government and
our civil society must engage in discussions about the public value of a national
policy to stimulate, preserve and diffuse the traditional art productions, in a
society that encourages, supports and promotes individual creative expression. In
truth, the transformative power of the arts to sway perceptions and change
attitudes rests in arts education and cultural programs.

The World Conference on Arts Education is in March 2006, Lisbon Portugal.
