WOE AND REDEMPTION

In the brooding light of the evening

a man and a woman stood in the gap talking
though not too close

for appearance sake,

because you know how people are...

Somebody had slapped somebody with a cutlass
a little earlier before

for I-don’t-know-what,

so the air was still charged

and begging for a reprieve

from the wilful and malicious damage

that was caused.

My mother cast her shadow in the doorway
(I was still pretty small)

and called me in

so as not to be looking

in grown people’s faces

when they were discoursing.

Also just in case

(and under dark breath)

the man’s wife came home sudden,
saw him lounging about the gap
with the pai-pai woman

and decide to take recourse in a rock
for clarification purposes.
