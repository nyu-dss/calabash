And the good Lord knows
that rock-stones
have a bad landing policy...

Even from inside we rent-house

you could smell a bitter, humid earth
somebody burning stuff

and a couple of houses down from ours
hear a neighbour studiously singing

or if you would prefer,

minding her own business

out loud as possible.

Jesu meek and gentle...

Her rendition was a cross

between pampalam and a hymn

and enough to set the Saviour weeping
with the fine warble

and the range â€”

thorough expiation
for the soul.

Gilkes / 51
