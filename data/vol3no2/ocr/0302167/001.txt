FROM A CRITIC’S MIND

PAINTING WITH WORDS AND MAKE US SEE:
LORNA GOODISON’S CONTROLLING THE SILVER

Ever since the publication of Tamarind Season (1980), Lorna Goodison has been
celebrated as one of the most authoritative Caribbean voices. Turn Thanks (1999) was
praised as a “turning point in contemporary Caribbean poetry,”' and writer Kwane
Dawes, in his review of Guinea Woman and Turn Thanks, went even further, placing
Goodison in the company of a Nobel laureate and of the ‘father of Caribbean aesthetics’:
“Tt is now officially, Walcott, Brathwaite, Goodison.”

Now, with Controlling the Silver, Lorna Goodison takes the reader on a longer
and more complex passage out of the islands and across the wide seas (and back). The
collection (of which some poems have been published or read earlier in various media)
revolves around a voyage that transcends a personal, physical trip. Each poem is a tessera

in a mosaic, a brushstroke in an enormous fresco whose concept resides in each stroke
