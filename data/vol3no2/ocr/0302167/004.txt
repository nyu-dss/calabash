Buy out the bar with counterfeit.

Eat off the bammy and roast fish.
Turn round and wipe-out Arawak
with pillage, plunder, and disease.

“Don C and the Goldman Posse”

In Controlling the Silver Goodison moves in more than one direction. If in the
20th century the new language of T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land and James Joyce’s
Finnegans Wake formed a breach with the past and was regarded as bearer of a new
meaning, a new way of rendering reality, perhaps we may say the same thing about a
number of contemporary Caribbean writers, with Lorna Goodison certainly being one of
the most talented among them and her use of language one of the richest and most
impressive.

The poetry of the new world takes the place of the past one, and though treasuring
it gives it anew form. History Odius Odius, the first part of “These Three Butterflies and
One Bird We Interpret as Signs,” is just one among many examples of this new form, of a
playful, sophisticated use of words, virtuoso sounds and images that follow one another

through the stanzas, to stop with a sudden turn to Jamaican Creole:

Leave earth Nymphalid,
soar and stay bourne within
spirit breath, doctor breeze’s

reviving, bearing currents.

Calderaro / 170
