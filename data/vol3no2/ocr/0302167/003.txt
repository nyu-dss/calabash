Cross and the passion, not only of an individual but of a whole enslaved people, uprooted

and transported across the Ocean’.

The narrator’s story, interlaced with historical cross-references, memories of past
generations, of exceptional women and epochal events, becomes a choral quest to find
the deeper roots of a people, to define a national consciousness whose origins lie in both
the Caribbean and Africa, and to build a collective and historical memory that would
encompass the various personal memories.

The poet, thus, becomes a receptacle (if we may borrow a T. S. Eliot coinage) of
an infinite number of memories, and these memories are rendered by Goodison through
startling metaphors, sudden clashes of contrasting images and juxtaposition of situations
in a rich and strong language that mixes standard English with Jamaican Creole. The use
of Creole, indeed, becomes the strongest and only means to give the Arawak a voice, and

recount their ordeal:

Don C and the goldman posse

arrived by leaky caravelle taxi,

and barely made it to the beach,

and as dem reach so, dem start

with the hold down and take way.
* The idea of pilgrimage is conveyed by many biblical references, rendered through either a Rastafarian
interpretation — as in “Jah the Baptist” (“In those Bible stories our mothers read to us,/John the Baptist was
dread righteous Rastaman’”) — or characters whose tongues merge to give life to a new language — as in
“The Wandering Jew and the Arab Merchant on the Island of Allspice” (“All the way along the Damascus

road, the Jew/has come to sell his things to the freed Africans./The Arab came following the long spice
route/to this island of Allspice. Shalom and Salaam/becomes ‘Sallo’ on the tongues of the Africans.”).
