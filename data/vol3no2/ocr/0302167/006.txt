the receptacle of truth, the historian that carries memory across the ocean. Like John
Keats’s Grecian urn, this work of African art communicates far beyond what may be
perceived by the senses, and will continue to tell its story to future generations.

However, this vessel is not, as Keats would say, a “silent form... teasing us out of
thought.” It does not offer a story that is out of time to be discerned by the poet nor is it a
mere art object. Rather, it reports the untold history of Afro-Caribbean slavery, giving
voice to the voiceless and telling a story that is painfully current. It is through the creative
process that the calabash becomes one with the poet, both being the receptacles of
memory. Lorna Goodison emerges here as a true historian of our times.

Controlling the Silver defies reductive categorizing such as Old World/New
World or Western/Eastern. And if we were to say that it is the finest Caribbean poetry
book we’ve read this year, we'd be limiting its importance. It is, quite clearly, one of the

finest books in contemporary world literature, a rich and satisfying feast for the mind.
