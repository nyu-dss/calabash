CODENAME: BREADFRUIT

My uncle used to grin and call it Sky Pudding
my grandmother with little reserve

Bread-Wine

Bread-Kind
though it would hardly seem kind
to sliver off the skin
cut the heart out with a knife
and offer up the flesh
pun the old pinewood palette
my grandfather saw
and chisel with his own two hand
into something
roughly beautiful

but for all we pickâ€™ny mouth
it sacrifice itself
(hopefully with pork and cucumber)
to feed
I say rejoice

while others might contend

Cooling-Tea and Balm
and how them yellow leaf
does ensure a good medicinal
for when the pressure
mount high
inside the cranny of you head
