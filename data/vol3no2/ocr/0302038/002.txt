Roast Fruit
cause in the grass-piece
when the fellows was just out
to savour the blacken skin
the sweet burn-taste
with a trickle of butter
in them mouth
look at how
it perform the oath of camaraderie
and catch them joker-smoker
by the gist of their belly
and the faculty
of their nose
Who does plant breadfruit tree in a yard
for decoration
local island ambience
though I can assure you
that that is just another bonus

a added respect
