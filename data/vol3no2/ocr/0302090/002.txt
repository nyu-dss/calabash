In the midst of soft resolve and even softer sheets

Under the threat of disillusionment and the promise of despair

Trampled and hustled and outnumbered and outgunned

I will not be lost here

In a game with rules not of my own making

Between Park Place and a ‘Go Directly to Jail’ card

Inside the upside of a market on the downside

In the midst of depression brought on by a recession

Under the yoke of armed guards and the tyranny of armed bandits

Trampled and hustled and overworked and undercompensated

I will not be lost here

David facing Goliath with a broken slingshot

Between too black to be white but not black enough to be black

Inside leftover-from-slave-time Diaspora disputes

In the midst of why Black men can’t love sistahs with locs

Under the weight of a people and the heaviness of an empty womb

Trampled and hustled and out of time to play with time
