I will not be lost here

Having nothing left to gain or prove

Between wanting to play in the sun and needing to act like a grown up
Inside recollections of sweet steel echoes hiding in my memory

In the midst of images of golden sand scattered on warm stretches
Under the influence of a tempo that beckons me to come home

Trampled and hustled
