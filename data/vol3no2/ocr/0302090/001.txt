SOJOURNERâ€™S SONG

eee
I will not be lost here
In the confusion of tall buildings
Between the sheer noise and the sad music
Inside a corner office or some forgotten ghetto
In the midst of hard bodies and harder hearts
Under the snow and the sometime sunshine

Trampled and hustled and maneuvered and outmaneuvered

I will not be lost here
In a slow going nowhere love fraud
Between the bill collectors and the short dollars

Inside the loneliness and outside the in crowd
