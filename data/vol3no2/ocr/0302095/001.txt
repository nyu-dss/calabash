SUNDAY MORNING

thunder faced you hold your children
babbling brooks protected from

the flood of daddy's fears

by strong arms

that grip your little girl

talkative accusing daddy I want to come home
as your eyes trail her mother

man eyes

a dyke that holds back the deluge
your son tugs at your collar

so close to your heart

pulls it up to his mouth

sucks saturates it with saliva

you glance down

so close to your heart
