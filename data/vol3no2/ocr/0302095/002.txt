not sure that the wetness has come from his mouth
and your daughter's fingers crawl up your neck
insy winsy spider

you pull your children closer

shields

as their mother wheels the shopping cart past
her upper body rigid

impaled by the javelins in your eyes

her refusal to look is

her shield

fragile as paper

and you are both forced to conduct

this jousting match of shame and guilt and anger and
love

in the arena of C.K. Greaves supermarket

in a country so small that

a man has no place to hurt

except in full view

in a country so small that

a man has no place to forgive

except in full view

in a country so small that

love is weakness and

forgiveness weaker still
