A CARRIACOUAN VIEW
OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA:
“AFRICAN” THEMES IN THE PAINTINGS
OF CANUTE CALISTE

Emmanuel “Canute” Caliste' is a former sailor, shipwright, carpenter, fiddle
player, and artist from Carriacou, Grenada.” He started painting for his own amusement
in his youth and began to sell his paintings in the late 1960s. Although some of his
paintings hang in local business places, in museums, and in the Grenada Governor’s
residence, most are sold to tourists. The themes he paints are of his own liking. Some
ideas come to him from dream or visions. He has painted many scenes that depict a
Carriacouan view of the African Diaspora. These include the “Big Drum Dance;” prayer

meetings and funerals; mermaids; various Carnival scenes; quadrille dances; and

' | [will refer to Emmanuel Caliste in the various ways that he is called in Carriacou, where the older

generation was reluctant to use one’s given name. I will refer to him as “Canute,” “Mr. Canute” (an
honorific), or “Papa C.C.” (an informal name given to him in his village and based on the “C.C.” he
sometimes writes as a signature to his paintings).
