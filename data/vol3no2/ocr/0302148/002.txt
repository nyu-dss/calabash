“African” houses (that once were built in Carriacou). Mr. Caliste considers himself a
repository of the island’s traditional culture. Beyond Carriacou itself, his paintings are

evocative of many traditional customs that bind coastal West Africa to the Caribbean.

Biographical Sketch.

Canute Caliste was born in L’Esterre Carriacou, Grenada, on July 15, 1914. As
with most Carriacou people of his generation, “Papa C. C.” is “African.” Mr. Canute is
Ibo, an African heritage of many people from his part of the island and one of the four
most important groups on the island. The others are Cromanti (the “first nation’),
Manding, and Temne. This identification with Africa predates the 1960s and was shared
by only a few societies in the Americas (the others are the Haitians and various maroon
groups).

When Canute was nine years of age and was walking near the local oyster bed
between his home village of L’Esterre and Harveyvale, he had his first encounter with a
mermaid. As he crossed a bridge that jumped a tongue of the lagoon, he heard the waves
crashing against the rocks. With great surprise, he saw a mermaid sitting on a rock,
combing her hair. "So when I peak, you see, I think it's a spirit and then I screech out and
when I screech out she just like so, pum-joomp, she go down in the water... . So I'm
running and I see she was coming behind me. . ." (quoted by Lynette Diaz). About a
week later, Mr. Canute saw the mermaid in a vision; she told him that she was “Queen of
the Sea," "God's Sister," and that he should not be afraid. She placed The Book, the
Bible, against her chest and said, "You will live by this until you die. " The mermaid had
given him the confidence to engage in any pursuit he chose in life.

Canute dropped out of school to help his parents grow subsistence crops. It is
possible that he learned how to read and write a little before dropping out of school.
Through the course of his life he became a sailor, took up carpentry, boat building,
seafaring, music, and painting. He also had many children; twenty-two to be exact (three
with his wife and nineteen others with eight girl friends).

From childhood, Canute painted scenes on interior house partitions, on boards,
and on any likely surface. Sometime after 1961, the Canada-based Madonna House Lay

Catholic Order started a branch in Carriacou (Sister Trudy Cortens, personal
