drummers are singers and the crowd, which together form the “ring” around the dancers.
The ring is open in the foreground, so that Papa C.C. is able to paint an interior view of
the dancers, singers, and drummers, without the view being blocked by spectators in the
foreground. It appears as if a woman is dancing between two men, but that sort of dance
unit does not normally occur: individuals dance alone in the Big Drum, although when
one gives way to another (either could be male or female) they grab each other and whirl,
with one dancer taking over the center of the ring from the other. In the painting, the
woman has her skirt pulled out on either side at the waist to show her petticoats. Her
dress is Carriacou’s version of the nineteenth century formal Creole outfit. An oldoe
player would not be part of a belair dance. The oldoe is only played for certain Nation
Dances called “beg pardons” — those performed to please the ancestors - and can be either
Cromanti or Manding Nation dances.

The next Big Drum painting I have by Mr. Canute was painted in the middle
1970s and shows a variety of flesh tones, ranging from light blue-grey to light brown, to a
dark blue-grey-brown. This scene is similar to the first example except the oldoe player
is gone and there are fewer people at the sides and rear of the ring. It carries the
following inscriptions: “Mr. Canute Caliste. African Dance Big Drum. The singer in
Carriacou Isla.” The female singers are on the right and the male singers behind the
drummer, illustrating the sometimes separation of the sexes during public occasions.
(There is no formal separation for the Big Drum performance. This suggests the usual
public pattern of the separation of the sexes rather than a feature of the Big Drum dance.)

Big Drum paintings from the late 1990s show the growth of Mr. C.C.’s art:
drummers are in a open space in a cotton field and the singers have more formal outfits,
various iconic bushes frame the ring, the towels carried in many of the performances are
clearly shown, a dancer is featured by herself with no other people in the painting, Big
Drum dancers are accompanied by his quadrille group (something that probably never
happens), and people that appear to be dancing a quadrille are performing in front of

drummers.
