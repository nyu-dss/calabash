number in the hymnal. A man has his hands raised; he is the “chairman” who acts
like a referee between the seated people who favor one hymn or another. The
table is covered with a white tablecloth — missing is the sail or tarp that normally
roofs the table and protects the people from rain. On the table are three settings of
plastic flowers, several bottles of “jack” rum (180 proof), and two pitchers of
water, drunk along with the jack.

Conclusion.

The “African Themes” in the title of this paper are African Diasporic themes, a
continuously created mix of available cultural resources from diverse sources, most
assuredly including West Africa, that have been blending in the central Atlantic region
for over four hundred years. These African themes are both putative and historic. In the
case of Papa C.C.’s attributions of his specific Ibo heritage, his sense of waddle and daub
houses being “African,” and his labeling all components of the Big Drum dance as
“African,” show his beliefs of his own history. The actual historic “African-ness” of
these characteristics is a much harder nut to crack and is a very complex problem.

What we have in the Diaspora is a Creole cultural calaloo. Creole culture, like
Creole languages, exists in as many varieties that one chooses to name, from coastal West
Africa, throughout the Caribbean and elsewhere. Moreover, as with Creole languages,
there are aspects of this Creole culture that seem more at home with Euro-American
culture and other elements that seem to fit a West African model culture. There are
“standard” versions of this culture and vernacular versions, elements that even the most
localized Creole cultures share and idiosyncratic “deep” cultural elements that can be
understood only in the most abstract way outside their context. It is not as important to
see this “deep culture” as simply “African” or “somewhat African” as it is to understand
thoroughly the cultural context of some particular activity as that context gives that
cultural heritage meaning. Papa C.C.’s African culture comes alive only when its
meaning is revealed although this very understanding shrouds specific historic
connections. Even the sense of African-ness in his eyes and in the eyes of other

Carriacouans may change through the ages.
