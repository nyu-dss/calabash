The Wake Cycle of Paintings.

The core of rituals for ancestors is an elaborate cycle of wakes, beginning with the
first wake; the burial on the following day; prayer meetings (also called wakes) three,
nine, and forty nights after the death; and then annual prayer meetings held until money is
gathered to place an expensive tomb on the grave. Modeled after the forty days Christ
wandered the earth before ascending into heaven this series of wakes nevertheless has the
feel of an African funerary ritual. The focus of the rites is to comfort the ancestor more
than it is to act out Christian belief. If the dead relative is well treated, that is, if the
wakes are big, boisterous, yet respectful; if a “parents’ plate” (a “Saraca,” ritual food for
the dead) has been properly maintained; if dreams from the ancestor are given their due;
and if a tombstone is purchased and set within a few years of the burial then the deceased
will be pleased and will return to his grave and will not trouble living relatives with so
many requests. Once entombed a satisfied ancestor is said to join the “old parents.”

The fact of a death is sounded around the island, or in Mr. Canute’s words:

Well, the first thing that they do — they make contract to bury the Dead

[i.e., hire gravediggers] And then they moan. They cry, you know. They

announce it by call, send a few parties. Ring the news over the island, and

say that Mr. Harry is dead and will bury at four o’clock today. In English

they say, “Who hear, tell the others — Sa ki tann, parlay lot.”

Mr. Canute’s burial painting is also detailed and, as with his other paintings,
shows the ideal rather than an actual burial:

After that person dead today, the next day they will get ready. And they

will go and bury them at the same hour, which — they say — which — is

four o’clock. Now they are on their way, going to the cemetery. Now to go

and have burial.

The setting for the burial is the Harveyvale graveyard. A school that is actually behind
the graveyard has been converted in Papa C.C.’s mind — into a church in the painting,
from which a priest and two alter boys are heading toward a funeral procession. Two
men lead the procession carrying a banner. I have never seen this feature of a burial; it

may have been part of burials in the past. (Flags and banners form an important part of
