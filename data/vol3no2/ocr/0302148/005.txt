there are three mermaids. In the middle 1970s, he began writing captions at the bottom
of the painting, which reveal his ideas about the mermaid’s attributes: “the Queen of
Peace,” “The Maide going out for a view,” “The Maid having fun in the lake,” “The
Mermaid resting in her gardain,” “Framed Mermaid cry out for peace and joy to the
world,” “Studying the days in the year — peace and love to the whold,” “The Mermaid
said on earth peace bee on to the siner on earth,” and “the Mermaid in the lake restin

praying for sinner on euth.”

The Big Drum Nation Dance.

The core of Carriacou’s folk religion is the Big Drum or Nation dance. Such
dances are always given for the pleasure of the dead, the ancestors of living Carriacouans.
Living people communicate with the dead through the Big Drum performance. As noted
above the dead return the communication through dream messages. Big Drum dances are
sometimes a part of an elaborate cycle of funerary rituals. These events are dramatized in
Mr. Caliste’s paintings: the Big Drum dance, the burial, the wake, and the tombstone
feast.

A dance for the ancestors of a particular West African ethnic group - a Nation
dance - usually has one dancer at a time. Nation dances are given to pay respect to
particular West African ethnic groups from which Carriacouans are thought to descend.
These dances are always played in a special order, with the Cromanti dances coming first.
After the Nation dances, the belair, and other dances are played, still for the enjoyment of
the ancestors.

Mr. Caliste’s Big Drum Dance paintings show a typical configuration of three
drummers, singers, and dancers, all collected around an area called “the ring.” The oldest
Big Drum painting available is one he painted at my request in 1971. Itis framed and
illustrates a generic Big Drum dance, with elements from the belair and others from a
Cromanti or Midnight Manding. Two male and one female dancer face three drummers.
To the left is a woman playing a chac-chac and to the right is another woman playing the

“oldoe,” a hoe blade hit with a piece of iron.’ To their right and left and behind the

> As with the cowbell in many West African rituals and the “bottle and spoon” in Trinidad’s carnival, the

oldoe, which is hit to beckoning the ancestors, may be viewed as capturing the spiritual essence of the
ritual, the moment that the ancestors or spirits are called by the people.
