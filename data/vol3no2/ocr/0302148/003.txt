the late 1960s, one of the sisters noticed that he painted figures on wood and on scrap
board. Sister Trudy thought that there was something to his painting but she knew very
little about it. The sisters suggested that Mr. Canute paint on pressboard so that his
paintings could be sold to tourists. Then, they sent one of his paintings to a curator at the
Royal Museum in Saskatchewan. They wanted to find out if his painting was “childlike”
or was “good.” The curator wrote them back saying that his painting was an excellent
example of “primitive” art and not childlike at all. It was the work of a master painter
who is unschooled. He suggested that they should not interfere with his painting style in
any way.

The sisters began to sell his paintings at the Madonna House in Carriacou. The
checks for his sales were made out to him and the sisters taught him how to write out his
name in a formal way (sometimes he spelled his name with a double ‘I’ but usually he
spelled it as Caliste) but apparently he already could write phonetically. In the late 1960s
and early 1970s, most of his paintings were marketed at the Madonna House itself. Sister
Trudy remembers that some of his paintings sold from the time they were first displayed,
although few tourists visited the island in those days. Jim Rudin, an American, moved to
Grenada in 1968 and eventually opened an art gallery, “The Yellow Poui,” which he still
runs (personal communication, March 19, 2004). He also provided Mr. Canute with
acrylics and pressboard. Although Papa C.C. began writing captions on his paintings on
his own, Rudin encouraged the practice.

In the early 1970s, when I was living in Carriacou doing anthropological
fieldwork toward my Ph.D., I ordered a set of paintings depicting scenes of Carriacouan
folk life as I knew it — that is, the choice of subject was largely my own and not his (an
important issue for scholars of outsider art). I was not as interested in the paintings as I
was in getting him to talk about Carriacouan culture. When Mr. Canute completed the
paintings, I interviewed him about them, recording his brief descriptions of each painting.
Those early paintings all had hand-made frames, which were painted pastel colors to
augment the coloring of the painting. Other than this original set that I purchased, few of
any of his later paintings were framed by him. Those early paintings were signed “Mr.

Canut Calist,” “Mr. Canut. C.,” or “Mr. C.C..” (Later paintings from the 1990s are
