Carriacou’s iconic culture and may front carnival masquerade bands, fly from houses
during weddings, or the yards of Spiritual Baptists.) The coffin, carried by six male
pallbearers, is behind the banner. The casket has been placed on two yellow chairs, a
common procedure in the funeral processions of former times. This gives the pallbearers
time to rest, as the graveyard could be miles from the house where the wake has taken
place. Behind the pall bearers are two lines of people, one made up of women and the
other with men. As this is one of Mr. Canute’s paintings completed in 1971, the only
writing is his signature, “Mr. Canut Calist.”

Another painting shows a typical prayer meeting or wake. This is Papa C.C.’s
description of this painting (recorded on July 9, 1971):

Well, in the wake they gather a crowd. Seat them. Pray. Tell Nancy

stories. They talk about. And then they have all their drink. And then

they get up. And after that, they break bell [barrel]. Yes, they make a

Parents’ Plate [special food for the deceased]. Kill beasts and cook food

and put on the Table [Saraca]. And then they sing [hymns].
In this quote Papa C.C. refers to “Nancy stories.” These are Carriacou’s version
of the Asante cycle of trickster spider tales. “Break bell” refers to the custom of
breaking an empty wooden rum keg in honor of a dead sailor. The top of the
barrel is cut out and sticks are put into it to mimic rigging on a vessel. Men grab
the stick and circle the barrel while singing shanties and slamming against the
sides of the barrel until it breaks.

This prayer meeting painting is one of Mr. Canute’s most detailed early
paintings. There are two buildings pictured, as is a flowering tree. To the left
there is a kitchen, from which two men are bringing a basket of food, a teakettle,
and a bottle. A woman brings a tray full of some unknown goodies, perhaps some
“bakes.” Four other people are heading toward the house, a large building in the
center of the painting, which contains the body of the deceased (not shown). In
front of the house, in highly stylized fashion — enlarged so that Papa C.C. may
paint the detail he requires — is the prayer meeting table. Most of the men and
women seated around the table carry hymnals, from which hymns are selected for

singing. A woman has her hand up; she is probably requesting a hymn by the
