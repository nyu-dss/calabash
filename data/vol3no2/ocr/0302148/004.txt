usually signed “© Mr. Canute Caliste.”) None of the paintings have written comments,
his hallmark since about 1975. It is these cryptic remarks that gives us an inside look at
his thinking about the painting.

Although Papa C.C. continued to paint subjects upon request, the body of his
work strongly suggests his world, not that imposed by the others. He has painted the
mermaid (his favorite theme), tourist beach houses, whaling, planting cotton, “African”
houses (a local term for “grass” or waddle and daub houses), boats of all kinds, the
Empire State building (seen on his first visit to the United States), the Grenada war, the
Big Drum Dance, Quadrille dances, government buildings and churches, kites, islands,
the “jackular” (the devil), boat building, the “bush” (trees, plants), “beasts” (animals),
Jesus, the Last Supper (with 14 disciples!), jet planes, pierrots, graveyards, and many
other topics. His folk art paintings are now sought in many parts of the world and hang

in galleries in the Caribbean, Europe, and the United States.

Mermaids in Carriacou.

Carriacou has many examples of the presence of a water spirits or mermaids.
Carriacou’s mermaids seem related to Mami Water, the ubiquitous water goddess in West
Africa. When we look at Carriacou’s mermaid - her under-ocean travels, her ability to
control weather, her arbitration of luck or fate - we see attributes identical with those
possessed by Mami Water. The main difference is that in Carriacou only the “Shango
Baptists” that have organized rituals directed to her. Mr. Canute and the others who are
not “Shango” Baptists know of her through personal experience and not involvement in a
religious organization.

Canute Caliste’s mermaid is a “light skinned woman” with a finned tail, which
sometimes has a zipper. He told me once that he saw her unzip her fin to reveal two
normal feet. It was in the middle 1970s, when he was on his first visit to New York City,
to perform for the Carriacouan community in Brooklyn and at the American Museum of
Natural History, where I was a curator. He was watching television in his hotel room and
the mermaid appeared on the TV screen.

In Carriacou, the mermaid is usually in the lagoon where he first spotted her. Her

hands may be either in a waving position, at her side, or carrying a cross. In one painting
