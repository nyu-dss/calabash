Stepping on the one
Small,

Sharp

Splinter

I hadn’t noticed.

I am used to

Marveling at the beauty of the object:
Even in its state of destruction;
Marveling at your inability

To see what I see.

Do I have

X-ray vision,

Or is this a degenerative

Disease of the mind

Which causes me to hallucinate?

I am used to,
“Baby we can put it back together

I have some crazy glue”.

I am used to
Crazy glue

Cementing my skin,
