US and UK manufacturers and wholesaler of artist supplies, putting forward our
case, and seeking volume discounts and/or straight donations. In all but two
instances, we received negative responses.

To supply our own artists, as well as to now assist in the re-supply of art
and craft materials for the many schools which have been damaged by two
storms in the last 10 months, requires a massive collective effort. The artworks
of about 20 artists will represent Grenada visually at a fundraising exhibition at
the Galerie d'art Nader, Coral Gables Florida, USA on August 05. This
important fundraising initiative is on behalf of our beleaguered colleagues who
lost supplies and works of art, representative of a substantial portion of their
livelihood last September, and again during the recent passage of Hurricane
Emily.

The funds raised from this Florida event, we anticipate will provide a
20ft container of supplies - student and artist grade paints, brushes, canvas,
panels, papers, charcoal, pastels, etc etc adequate to supply our artists and the
students.

We wish to make contact with any manufacturers and wholesalers who
would be willing to work with us to make this a reality, plus anyone interested in
the development of our artistic community to please contact the GAC co-

coordinator Suelin Low Chew Tung at slct@caribsurf.com.
