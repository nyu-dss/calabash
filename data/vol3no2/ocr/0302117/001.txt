THE HONEY-GATHERER

Flapping his father’s loincloth, he tramps
up the mountainside, bearing two logwood

poles and an earthen jar, inured to

ivy imprint on shins, calves, thighs,
heedless of the ridges rising on his back

and shoulders: let bruises sign this ardor

of feet and hands. Aerialist in fog, he
dangles at rope’s end, a spindly spider

bouncing off sheer cliff-faces as he threads hives

to pry off sheaths of honeycomb, then swoop
them up with his pot. He floats in the ache

of drones who beat their last beats, pulse their last

for their siblings’ food — their stings so little
pain for so much sweetness. In their hum

and his prayers, he collects chambers glistening
