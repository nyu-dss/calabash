with the soft light of manna, flowing in song:
this is a passion of mouth and heart. And when

he returns home — laden and with a head-

hunter’s calm countenance, laughing with
his whole blistered body — he sings

through scattered teeth an offering of slow

stickiness, of spiraling joy settling in rings.
As he waves his hands across his face to

mime the rhythms of resistance, he sounds like

a tall-taler, this mountain magician,

this half-naked hunter with his sticks and stings

and jar, this riddled seeker blowing so much smoke.
