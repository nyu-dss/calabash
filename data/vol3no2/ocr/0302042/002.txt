the steam is visceral

and dissipates above the stove.

It seems the whole world

is in collusion some evenings

and the kettle has just willed itself
a clearer listening hole

where the silence obtrudes...

My husband soon reappears
and wonders how hard

could it possibly be

to grab a-hold of a simple knob
and turn it

anti-clockwise.
