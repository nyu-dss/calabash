KETTLES AND WHISLING HOLES

My husband comes home shorter
in the late afternoon

from a hard day’s work,

drops his briefcase on a side table
puts the kettle on to boil

asks me to listen out

for the whistle

and trudges up the stairs

to change.

Dutifully I start

to attune my ears.

But other things get in the way,
like this feeling

I sometimes have

that the whole island

is set adrift in the ocean

come evening

and sometimes I get the impression —
somebody pointed out

serotonin levels once

and I should take a pill —

that we are sinking slow

and further,

that we are either late for something vast
or vastly late for something...

The kettle wails its crescendo on cue.
The water changes into steam
