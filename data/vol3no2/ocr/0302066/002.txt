for lack of pasture.
Grenada mourns,
her parishes languish;
they wail for the land,
and a cry goes up from the villages.
Calm. Why are you scarce in the land,
like a stranger who stays only a night?
You are among us, O Lord,
and we call on your name:

do not forsake us!

â€œThe Nation Mourns is an adaptation of Jeremiah 14 of the Holy Christian Bible.

Peters / 67
