THE NATION MOURNS

The nation mourns,
her parishes languish;
they wail for the land,
and a cry goes up from the villages.
Bare-feet children look for provisions;
they head for the fields
but they find no fields.
They return with their crocus bags unfilled;
dismayed and despairing,
they bow their heads.
The ground is flooded
because there is too much rain in the land;
the farmers are dismayed
and bow their heads.
Even the sheep in the field
deserts her new born lamb
because there is no grass
Donkeys stand on the heights
and pant like jackals;
their eye sight fails
