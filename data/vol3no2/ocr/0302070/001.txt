SIX POEMS ABOUT THE LITTLE ISLAND OF

MINE

I. Exile

My hut of warmth,

summers and winter’s rain

that soaked my Sunday’s best to a wet mess.
I remember the platano smell of your conuco,
how I lost myself in your jungle of roots.

Il. Yolas

People hop these yolas for a dream;

I dream of days of no hunger,

no time to look at the sun

or else the guards of land will catch you.
I see, they cannot see who I am

under the ark of starvation,

sun deprivation has cruised through the seas
I left behind you.

Ill. The Trip

It was my milk that sustained you

through the Mona; this tore waves

and banged tears into darkness, until there
was nothing left of me, my breasts became
no more. I screamed no more; I have nothing
else to give, but death on this boat.
