SUMMER ESSENCE

Based upon the simplest thing â€”

the raw-sweet scent of rain,

guavas in a tray
at the fruit-stand
a couple blocks down

and suddenly that pond in the gully

next to the tier of trees
the fruit ripening

in their own incense,
plopping into the water
and continuing down
until they too had
fallen into

slow
disuse.

I missed that falling sound:
confusing

circumstance with pluck,
the trees powerless

to hedge their leaves

and stem

the drop.
