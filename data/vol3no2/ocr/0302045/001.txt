LIKE UNTO A MUSTARD A SEED

We had mustard greens in the yard

that nobody planted
so nobody think to water
yet they flourished

like said Kingdom of God

in the King James version of the truth

sprinkling the doorway
to we consciousness
with fine yellow flowers
proof that even

hard trampled earth
could sustain

the necessary joy

in a righteous house
dark seed

suspire hope

in the raillery of the sun

Mustard yellow
and fierce green
our yard

and visitors to the house
like birds
