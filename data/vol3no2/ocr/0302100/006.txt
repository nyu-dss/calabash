visually and display it as our own.

The freedom of information we currently enjoy, however, comes at a high price.
Our children, young people, and adults are bombarded with visual images from North
America via the TV, the Internet, and designer clothing. The effect is that these images
then become the story we tell, rather than our telling our own story. A proactive program
of cultural intervention must be embarked upon if we wish to have anything left of
ourselves to pass on to the generations to come. By intervention, I mean the active role of
helping to synthesize these ideas from the outside, interpret them within the local context,
accept some, reject some, but not let them overwhelm us and replace us. Defining who

we are as illustrated by our visual art then becomes the mortar for nation building.

I am not suggesting that every painting must be one with a little wooden house, a
donkey carrying goods to market, the men working in the fields, and the women washing
in the river. While these portray a glimpse into a fast-fading Caribbean way of life, this is

not our whole story. Abil Peratta Aguero, an art critic of the Dominican Republic writes:

Old clich√©s have been underlying a conception of Caribbean culture as an
active element of the international tourist industry. ...most of the rest of the
world see the Caribbean as a region of small states where typical aspects
of wild, exotic, funny and supernatural reign.... However, reality is

different. We are essentially a culture of real passions and dreams.3

In other words, we have much more to express than just the typical scene that a

tourist may purchase for a souvenir.
