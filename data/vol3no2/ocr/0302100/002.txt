I am an artist. Because my art education has been self-inflicted, it took me a long
time to be brave enough to say, "I am an artist." I did not go to school to become an artist.
My inner creativity was expressed at an early age. When given a "paint by number" set of
a portrait of a horse, I ignored the numbers and lines and painted a landscape scene of the
cane field and old windmill that I saw out my window from our residence in Barbados.
My parents, themselves educators, encouraged me to be a teacher. They viewed art as a
nice hobby, but certainly not something that would sustain a girl in for the future. Three
degrees in education later, I still had a deep need to express myself in colour and paint.
Living in Dominica at the time (teaching, of course), a teenager would often come to our
house to visit. He was a nascent artist himself, and when he saw my amateurish attempts
at painting, he told me "You could do much better than this." He began to give me
constructive criticism, and I started to paint in earnest. Thus began a journey in visual art

that continues to this day.

When I returned to Grenada to live permanently in 1992, I immediately began to
paint scenes from Grenada, and exhibit with the Grenada Arts Council. For many, many
years the Grenada Art Council had hosted an annual show at Marryshow House. As a
teenager I had visited the exhibit every year - admiring the work, longing to know the
secrets of the artists - how did they do that? I believe that my history is typical of that of

many small islanders; the desire to create art very strong, yet the opportunity, limited.

The reality of the state of visual art in Grenada is that it enjoys no institutional support.

Following are some examples of this.

Art education in primary and secondary school is very limited. When it is offered
in secondary school it is often relegated to those "who can't do so well academically." A
principal once told me that the only reason they prepare students for Art for the CXC is
so that some students can "at least get one O level." The traditional materials and supplies
needed to do art are expensive. The customs duty and the VAT tax, and the surcharge and
this that and the other often add up to about 65% added to the price of such items. A
secondary teacher from St. Andrew's shared with me that he was teaching calligraphy to

his students, but couldn't find the correct pens for them to practise with. When I asked
