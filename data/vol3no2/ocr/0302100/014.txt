In the year 2001, Caribbean Art Exchange was formed with links in Grenada and
Miami, with the vision of exposing Grenadian artist to the works of other Caribbean
artists and vice versa. The first exchange was held in February of 2001, with four
Grenadian artists displaying their work at the Diaspora Vibe Gallery in Miami. The
second exchange will take place in March of 2002, when Rosie Gordon-Wallace, founder
of the Diaspora Vibe Gallery and a U.W_I. graduate, will bring the work of four
Caribbean artists to be displayed in Grenada. Seminars and workshops in the visual arts
will be a part of this exposure. The co-operation of the U.W.I. centre in Grenada has
played a vital role in this exchange, and we look forward to an explosion of interest from

the local arts community in support of this effort.

The interesting concept of considering the visual arts as a sustainable resource is
that the development of human potential is not something that can be quantified in
numbers or statistics. It cannot be measured in terms of how many acres will produce
how many tons of bananas. It is not a pie with only so many pieces to be shared. But like
agriculture and fisheries, it must be invested in to. Structures must be put into place to
encourage the spirit of creativity in individuals, to develop skills to execute their ideas, to
provide vehicles to exhibit their work both in Grenada and abroad, and to ultimately instil
in a new generation a strong sense of pride of who we are as a people as expressed by our
visual art. This investment must come in several areas, education being key. Education in
the visual arts must be enhanced in the primary and secondary schools, provided via
programs on the local TV community channel, offered in community and church groups.
The investment must come in government and local business buying art from local artists
to display on their walls. The Ministry of Culture could begin to take a more active role
by assigning a department to the visual arts, and budgeting for its activities. And finally,
government and the private sector must join the art community in making a permanent
space for Grenada's art to be preserved. This space would include the permanent
exhibition of Grenada's art, as well as an educational aspect for documentation and

research.
