And yet another follows a similar vein:

Sustainable production and consumption involves business, government,
communities and households contributing to environmental quality
through the efficient production and use of natural resources, the

minimization of wastes, and the optimisation of products and services.2

The sustainable resource in our scenario is the creativity of the human spirit. It is
actually an intellectual resource, but needs the material and the physical to be expressed.
Like the resources of the earth, it can be abused, and used up. Like the products of

agriculture, if not given water and fertilizer and care, it will not thrive. It involves:

— business — the marketing and selling of works of art

— government, — the institutional support in education and physical structures

to exhibit art

— communities — the vibrant give and take of artists creating together and

— households — the family inculcating in the young the love and appreciation

for art

All these then contribute to the creative quality of life.

Sparks of creativity abound in the Grenadian community, but this resource must
be cultivated and invested in to reap the fullness of the potential reward. In the past
decade Grenada has become an environment where the nutrient pool is rich for creative
potential. We have had unlimited access to the press and news of the world through
television and the Internet. There is free speech and freedom to practice the religion of

where the world is at war, we in Grenada live in peace. The conditions are superb for a

cultural awakening. It is a time to invest in Grenada's culture and proudly interpret it
