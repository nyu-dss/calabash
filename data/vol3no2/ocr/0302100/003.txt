him about importing them for him, his response was, "Ah, but they wouldn't be able to
afford to buy them anyway." And this is quite true. Mr. Gordon de la Mothe, whom I will
speak about later, shared with me that he left Grenada some 50 years ago with a
Certificate in Art being the most he could obtain here. After studying and teaching art in
England all these years, he returned to Grenada in 1997 to find that the situation was just

the same.

Aside from material considerations, an even deeper problem exists for teachers
wishing to teach art. For the most part, our teachers in Grenada pass on what they have
been taught in school. Art history has never been a part of the core curriculum. Art is
often conceptualized just as the object that is produced, thus assigning it to the category
of a product. Also, there is no differentiation between art and craft, (craft being an item
that can be reproduced over and over). For the teaching of art to be a reality in our
primary and secondary schools the teachers themselves must have an understanding of
what art means in their lives. In the past I have taught workshops for teachers in "how to
teach art." We learned colour theory, we played with interpretation, we collected dried
grasses, seeds, coconut fibre and other natural items to be made into art. We made the
projects together; fun and excitement was the order of the day. Many of the teachers
expressed the view that they had never done anything like that when they were in school.
I thought, "Great, I have made an impact. I have shown them how to use local materials
to make art. These are things that are readily available, and don't cost much. This will be
a beginning of art in primary schools! Who knows which young Picasso will come forth
because of this exposure. Yeah!" I visited these teachers in their classrooms a few months
later to see what the lasting impact of the course was. I was sadly disappointed. Art class
was "take your pencil and tear a page from your exercise book and draw something you
like." Sigh. I could not effect positive change with a single course. It takes many
interactions from many sources to enhance a person's perception of the intrinsic value of

self-expression.

This dilemma is broader than the educational system. We have not been endowed
with a national appreciation for visual art. Aside from the visual trappings of Carnival,

we do not perceive art as a necessary part of our cultural environment. Take, for example,
