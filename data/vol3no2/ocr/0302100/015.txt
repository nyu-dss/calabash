Art, as a sustainable resource, is exemplified by Gilbert Nero. He was young, out
of school, and "liming on the blocks." A local gallery owner gave him some paint and a
few instructions. When Gilbert didn't have money to buy canvas, he begged his mother
for old bed sheets, which she gave, and he painted on those. Gilbert continued to come
back for criticism, instruction, and help. He exhibited with the Grenada Art Council in
1997, displaying a huge painting of a fanciful insect - his own interpretation. His large
painting of sailing boats now hangs behind the bar at Secret Harbour Hotel. Art changed
his life. It took him away from "the blocks" and the temptation to give in to the use of
drugs; it gave him confidence, and told him that his story was important, too. He is now
working on a cruise ship, and every time he returns to Grenada he brings his latest works

of art with him.

With or without institutions for support, artists will continue to exist in all
countries, even Grenada. The question is, will the country benefit from those artists,
culturally, socially, and economically? As our society develops, the need for artists to be
the interpreters and the storytellers becomes even greater. I encourage our government,
our schools, and our private sector - make the investment into this sustainable resource
now. If you ever have to wonder if the potential is really there, just remember another

storyteller of Caribbean origin. His name was Bob.
