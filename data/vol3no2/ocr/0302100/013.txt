Mr. Gordon de La Mothe is a Grenadian who returned after many years of
teaching art in England. Since 1999 he has rendered his services at the T.A. Marryshow
Community College. Taking students who have virtually no background, he is preparing
them for "A" level examinations in art. The very encouraging aspect of this is that two of

his students who were successful in obtaining passes are now teaching art in secondary

schools. It is a beginning.

The Sissons Paint Company has locally been developing an artist quality acrylic
paint. It is of good student grade quality, and available at a price that is much cheaper

than the imported variety. This is very positive for schools and students.
