the "Festival of the Arts" which has been produced by the Ministry of Culture every two
years for decades. While dance, drumming, choirs, soloists, instruments, and other
performing arts are very successfully encouraged, the visual arts are not even included.
Art is not present in public spaces. When you walk into a government office, even in the
Ministry of Culture, you do not see art on the walls, nor when you enter the country at the
airport or seaport. Monuments have not been a part of what we leave behind for the next
generation. Even the preservation and collection of Grenada's art has not been a priority.

We have no Museum for the display of visual art.

This lack of institutional support exhibits itself in the practical. When an
exhibition of Grenada's art is shown in another country, we are required to go through the
same process with customs as if we were exporting goods for sale. One such occasion
took me no less than seven visits to different ministries, hiring a broker to prepare paper
work, carrying the papers back to the customs officer, finally to the Comptroller of
Customs, all to ensure than after the work was exhibited abroad, when it came back we
would not have to pay duty on it. Mind you these were works of art created in Grenada
by Grenadian artists. There is no legislation regarding the exchange of art for exhibition
between countries; every interchange is taken on an individual basis, thus going over the

same ground again and again.

If we look to our history there are many reasons as to why as a nation we have
evolved in this way. It is beyond the scope of this paper to study the aspects of
colonialism, independence and nationhood and its effect on the visual arts. Therefore, we
do not look back to cast blame at any source, but we look forward to forge a strong
foundation for the future. History aside, we can no longer ignore this strong tool for

developing nationalism and cultural identity.

I believe that the visual arts are a sustainable resource that should be utilised in
nation building. This term "sustainable resource" is most often used in the context of
agriculture, eco-tourism, fisheries, or some other earth related science. The word
"sustainable" first appeared in 1727, having the definition of relating to, or being a

method of harvesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or
