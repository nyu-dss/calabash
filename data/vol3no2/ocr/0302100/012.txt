In spite of these many challenges, the visual arts in Grenada are alive and well.
Grenada has been well represented in world exhibits such as the IV Bienal de Arte Carib
in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic that is currently underway. (November
2001-February 2002) A few of Grenada's artists have exhibited in galleries in North

America, holding their own with the best of artists of the big countries.

The Grenada Art Council continues on a yearly basis to provide an exhibit for any
artist who wishes to participate. They do this without any government subvention, but
with the voluntary support of the business community and individual patrons of the arts.
Often this is the only avenue for beginning artists to display their work. Over a hundred
artists are on their list of those who have participated in the last few years. This is a
significant number. It has several times taken on the monumental task of sending exhibits
abroad. Grenada's art has been taken as a cultural ambassador to Barbados, The
Dominican Republic, Germany and the United States. During the 37-year history of the

Council, it has at times been the only candle burning in the night for the visual arts.
