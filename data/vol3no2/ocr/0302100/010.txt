Grenada's art has the capacity to bring many tourists to our shores. These tourists
stay in hotels, eat in restaurants, ride in taxis - spend dollars. Again, if the resource of the
visual arts is to yield benefit, it must be invested into in the area of marketing. When
foreign investors develop hotels here, it should be mandated that some of the art they use
to decorate their lobbies and rooms be created by Grenadian artists. What better venue for
exposing Grenada's art to visitors? Further, artists themselves must be recognized as
individuals who contribute to the building of Grenada's economy. Thus the same
concessions given to fishermen and farmers in allowing them to bring in equipment duty

Ministry of Sports pays the exit tax for athletes when they travel to compete, the Ministry
of Culture could pay the exit tax for artists when they carry an exhibit of Grenada's art to

be shown outside.

And this leads to the issue of Grenadians collecting our own art. One local
businessman was boasting of his terrific purchase of paintings when he was visiting Haiti.
"They were so cheap" he said, "I just couldn't help it, I bought 15 of them." I am sure that
the walls of his home are now bright and pretty, but what does that say for his
appreciation of Grenada's art? Does he know the names of those Haitian artists? Will he
follow their careers? When they are exhibited in an important world exhibition, will he
know? Will that work increase in value in the future? If it does, will he be aware? Or are
they just pictures to "stick up on the wall." The money for the purchase of those

paintings, no matter how "cheap," is now circulating in Haiti, not in Grenada. This isn't to
