Recently I encouraged an expatriate now living in Grenada to collect Grenadian
art. Her response was, "Oh, but I couldn't buy yours â€” it isn't Grenadian." Asking for
further explanation, she replied to me, "It doesn't look like the simple work of Canute
Caliste. It isn't primitive enough." Apparently she had been convinced that only the very

naive type of work was truly Grenadian art. She is sadly misinformed.

 

Painting by Susan Mains

Visual art in its true essence gives the artist the opportunity to express his or her
innermost thoughts and expressions within the context of his time and culture. This
expression can take many forms - it could be representational, as in the traditional painted

European format, or it could follow the impressionist movement of a hundred years ago.
