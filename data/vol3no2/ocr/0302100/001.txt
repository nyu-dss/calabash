THE VISUAL ARTS IN GRENADA:
A SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE

 

Painting by Susan Mains

One of the most defining moments of my artistic career was when an officer
attached to the Ministry of Culture turned down the Art Council's request for funding to
send an exhibit overseas. The reply given was, "Art is not a part of culture." Since that
time more than five years ago, I have observed in many ways that visual art is the

"outside child" of our institutional cultural milieu.
