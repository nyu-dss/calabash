artist anywhere in the world is that artists have to eat, too. Thus comes the reality that
works of art must be sold to sustain the artist, to provide money for materials to continue
to make art. The somewhat unique position an artist in Grenada has, is that the world
comes to Grenada to holiday. And when they come and enjoy the pristine beauty of
Grenada and the warmth of the Grenadian people, they wish to take a piece of that back
to their home with them. They want to relive that experience in their minds again and
again. A piece of art can be that bridge for them to return. Further, some tourists come to
Grenada specifically for Grenada's art. Our 87-year-old gentleman painter of Carriacou,
Canute Caliste, has had visitors from around the world come to visit him in his studio,

after reading an article about him in a travel section of a newspaper or magazine.
