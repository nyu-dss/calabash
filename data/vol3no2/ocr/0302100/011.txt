say that Grenadians should not collect the works of artists of other countries, but at some
point we need to consider nationalism. We suffer from the common misconception that
anything from anywhere else is of better quality and more valuable than what we can get

here.

In speaking with the owners of two local art galleries, I was informed that more
than 90% of their sales are to tourists. This is a double-edged sword. While good
economically, it also means that most of Grenada's art is being carried away from
Grenada - never to be seen by the next generation. This leads to yet another investment
that must be made; a permanent space for the visual arts to be displayed in Grenada. This
should take the form of a National Museum for Visual arts, including additional space for
an educational component. The Grenada Art Council for the past five years has been
collecting important pieces of Grenada's art with the concern that it be preserved for
Grenadians. Unfortunately, the collection is in storage, because of lack of an adequate

facility.

The investment for a permanent space is a large one. Government must take the
lead in such a venture. There is funding available through many sources: The
Organization of American States, the European Union, the World Bank, but this must be
accessed on the level of Government. This investment into a structure of such a building
is in reality an investment into the potential of people-an investment into the preserving

the past for the benefit of the future.
