ROAD SHOW

Before milk scald but after cock crow —
before breakfast start cook,
him stagger in, straggle in, come fe scare crow

loud something out a Dickens book.

Raking people’s sleep, shooing ’way mist
and swearing to Kingdom come,
parson come a yard a beat up him wrist

preaching heavy under him rum.

To show him what real sermon is,
missus rail up to batter him down. Since hot
tea no make and last night’s dinner cold,

she koof him with her chimney pot.

Chicken a fly off their roost
when holy head a burn and give,
fastened dogs go clear out loose

and donkey bray fe alternatives.
