CALALOO:
A REVIEW OF VOICES IN A NEW DAWN

Voices in a New Dawn, an anthology edited by Jean Buffong, Maureen Roberts
and Tony La Mothe, grew out of a project carried out by the St. John’s Educational Trust,
UK. A group of Grenadians living in London were brought together by Mr. Allister
Francis MBE, to build a library in the parish of St. John’s, Grenada. The library is
nearing completion and Voices in a New Dawn is a landmark collection which will take
pride of place in the library’s collection.

The anthology was conceived not only as a show case for Grenadian writers but
also as a fundraiser for the library project. It is the first time that such a collection has
been attempted. It is by no means comprehensive because although it contains work by
writers such as Merle Collins, Jean Buffong, Allister Bain, Ricardo Keens-Douglas,
Abdul Malik and Christopher DeRiggs many potential contributors are missing. Jacob
Ross is conspicuous by his absence; he contributed a great deal of time and effort in the
collection of works and assisted with the creation of the anthology. Joan Anim-Addoo’s

work is also missing from this first of what we hope will be a series of such books.
