The editors wanted to be as inclusive as possible for this first collection and this
can make for an uneven quality in the work included. It is a taster of the talent that is
available. The collection is organized into four sections and each includes short stories,
poems and essays. The themes are Grenadian culture, Relationships, Education, and
Migration. Contributions came from Grenadians living in South America, Canada,
America, England and Grenada.

There are poignant stories about living in other countries such as Esther
O’Neale’s Lament on a Winter’s Day and Loretta McMilan’s When Aunt Coralie Visits.
Classic folk tale style stories such as Ricardo Keens-Douglas’s Sebastian and the La
Diablesse_Stories, which try to unravel the mysteries of the interaction between changing
generations such as Merle Collin’s When Time Reach. Yolande Baker-Lewis novel
extract, Inforapenny, explores the cruelty that can reside at the core of the intimate
relationship between a man and woman.

The essays give the reader a chance to consider how issues such as migration have
changed Grenadians living at home and abroad. They engage with issues of education
for black boys in England and how the Grenadian family survives in the Diaspora.

Cleopatrice Andrew’s short story, J/licit Soup, overflows with nostalgia for a time
long past.

Voices in a New Dawn is an illicit soup of writing, which lends readers various

perspectives of what it is to be Grenadian..
