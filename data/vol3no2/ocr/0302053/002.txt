later that Ilearned to value that voice. When I went to university in Jamaica that
experience (of both voices) helped me to look at all of the issues of class, and of

inheriting various aspects of the island in a certain sense.

DOLACE: Well, you talk about inheriting the island, right? It seems that
inheriting the island is more than just what kind of space you occupied physically but
also the kinds of psychological and social messages that you got growing up as a child.
But at some point, the consciousness of that inheritance gets displaced and that would be

with the Jamaica experience, you would say?

COLLINS: Yes, yes, I would say with the Jamaica experience I came to have a
different sense of self. I came to be more conscious of the psychological and social
messages I got growing up, to question them and examine them. Jamaica in the early
1970s made me conscious of myself as a black person and of my inheritance as a

DOLACE: What was it like going to the University of the West Indies at the time

COLLINS: For me, it was a tremendous experience. I went to UWI in Jamaica

possible within the Caribbean and “as far away as possible” was found at UWI Jamaica.

Jamaica itself was, in a lot of ways, very important for me in terms of
development of ideas. That was the period when I---I already knew that I had an interest,
for example, in some aspects of academia and in art - I already knew that I had an interest
in theater. In Jamaica I did more with that, became part of the university theater group
and did some acting. I was also exposed to different artistic expressions — Jamaican
theatre, the poetry of Louise Bennett, the group Mystic Revelations of Rastafari, and the
ascendance of reggae. This was also Jamaica immediately after Walter Rodney had been
expelled. So there was a lot of political discussion---general discussion of socio-political
thought in the Caribbean. I wasn't in Social Sciences but most of my friends were and I

would go and sit in on Trevor Monroe's lectures, and talk to my friends who were doing
