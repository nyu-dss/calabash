doesn’t make sense to them.

DOLACE: Do you think there’s still a trauma in the Grenadian psyche? With the

U.S. invasion and all?

COLLINS: Oh, yes. But I’m listening to you and thinking that what is
traumatizing the Grenadian psyche is really not so much the invasion as what happened
before. I really don’t believe that the invasion is traumatizing the Grenadian psyche so
much as what led to it. Brother killing brother. That is what is so traumatic for

Grenadians.

JACQUELINE: You know, Merle it sounds as though---you are trying to
articulate what exactly happened. And now you are able to slowly and slowly to talk

about it .. .Where is he buried anyway, Maurice Bishop?

COLLINS: What? That is the real trauma for no one knows! There is a
memorial to him in St. George’s, but it’s not in terms of where his bones are buried! At
one stage there was a lot of talk about the recovery of the body but not much came of it.
That is still a big thing for Grenadian people so that even, you know, today people could

rally around where the body is buried in a symbolic sense.

JACQUELINE: No burial?

COLLINS: No, there has never been a funeral or the body being laid to rest in
that sense. No one knows -— officially - what happened to the bodies of those that were
killed! In a small island like that, though, everyone knows — speculation, hearsay,

whispers — but there has been no official declaration.
DOLACE: The resolution that is still lacking. . .
COLLINS: That is the resolution that is lacking still, yes...
DOLACE: Do you think you miss the Caribbean? I know you’re nostalgic for it.

COLLINS: Oh, yes. But there it is. For me it’s always---it’s a question of
always returning and always leaving. That is really what happens for me. Always

returning, but ever leaving.
