to the Caribs? It seems that it is always what is inside that is supposed to be preserved for
ourselves and the growth of our spirits and our self-esteem that’s not really being

preserved.

DOLACE: You also seem to be working on something about not just Grenada as

a political unit, but Grenada even just as a geographical space.

COLLINS: Yes, absolutely. In The Color of Forgetting - the struggle between
brothers that takes place in that book, over land, is, in a sense, a very contemporary

DOLACE: Politics versus the reality, the competition between what is real and

what it is that people kind of romanticize about the islands.

COLLINS: Right. So that in a sense, OK, perhaps this economic thing is sense
and truth, but it’s grand political sense and probably ideologically it’s right on, but you

have to find a way of working with the fact that because of people’s social history it
