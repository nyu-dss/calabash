DOLACE: Has anything happened recently that could bring you back to Grenada

to keep you there? Why can’t you stay?

COLLINS: Perhaps leaving is also a part of learning. And there are realities---
there are painful realities in the Caribbean that you want to escape, but you don’t want to

my socialization, is centered. And that is of such tremendous importance for me
personally, for me in the world, for all of those people there and for an understanding of

self and society.

I remember Lorna Goodison talking about reading a poem about her mother
somewhere in Italy and somebody jumping up and saying, oh that is my mother’s

situation exactly! And Lorna responded saying that, “Imagine I write my poem from
