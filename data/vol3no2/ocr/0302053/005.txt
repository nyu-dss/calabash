that I intend to deal with eventually. I wrote a poem, which is in the last collection, Lady

in a Boat, called “Shame Bush” which is basically talking about how the country has

DOLACE: Is there a shame and trauma about the invasion, do you think?

COLLINS: Well, you see---I have to pause because it's not only the invasion. In
a sense, it is easier to deal with the notion of the invasion than it is to deal with what

under house arrest. And we just kind of looked at each other in amazement because it
sounded impossible. After the announcement that night, the next day I went to work and

we were talking about events. At the time, I used to work at the Ministry of Foreign
