Bernard be Head of the party and Maurice be Head of the country i.e. Maurice would be
Prime Minister and Bernard would be party leader. You see, Bernard had always been
the ideologue, while Maurice had more of a rapport with people. Maurice was more of a

people person. The party needed him because he was very charismatic.

So I think what happened is that Maurice decided to break with the party. He
agreed to a party decision about joint leadership and then changed his mind after thinking
it through and realizing that it would in effect be stripping him of authority. Technically
I guess you could say that Maurice was wrong---this man, who has been supporting the
party all along, is now changing his tune and going against a decision made by the party
he has agreed is more important than any individual. He changed his mind about the role

of the party. That, to my mind, was where the major conflict was.

JACQUELINE: I still don’t understand however, how you moved from these two
people, who share the same ideology and same beliefs and all sorts of things to house

arrest and subsequently murder and killing someone.

COLLINS: That’s where I also become incoherent, because I do not know. I do
not understand how it got to that point. That’s why the invasion was in a sense so
welcomed by Grenadians, because people were so traumatized that any devil from
outside was welcome. . anybody from outside was welcome. This was all so confusing
and traumatic for me that I tried to sort some of my thoughts in writing, in my first novel
Angel, which came after the events in Grenada in 1983. How I came to write the novel is
that I had gone to England to get away from it all and I was doing a Ph.D. in Caribbean
governments, but all the events - everything that had happened in Grenada - were
occupying every possible space inside, in my head. And the Ph.D. was one kind of a
voice, but I didn’t have space for a lot of other voices that were occupying my
consciousness, yes. And in a sense those voices had to come out. So that sometimes on
my way from a class or from somewhere else I would be sitting on the train - and this is
really how Angel happened - I'd be sitting on the train just busily writing [Angel is

written largely by long hand], writing these stories, grappling with the voices in my head,
