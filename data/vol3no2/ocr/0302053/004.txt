COLLINS: Not just 1979, actually — the 1970s. 1979 was the year the New
Jewel Movement took over the government. It was a strange period. Even talking about
it now sometimes people say Grenadians were demonstrating because they didn't want
independence. But really, the demonstrations were because people were generally
unhappy with the Gairy regime which was in power at the time in Grenada---and the
perception was that Gairy was mainly concerned with having as much power as possible
within Grenada in order to continue a regime of repression. So that’s what people — in an
overwhelmingly youthful population - were demonstrating about. Not wanting
Independence under Gairy. Also, all of this was happening during the period of the
1970s when a lot of things were happening in the world. People were becoming aware of
the fact that they could demonstrate and express themselves against the socio-political
conditions in Grenada at the time. People were voicing their reactions against, for
example, the repressive attitudes of Gairy and against colonial attitudes in the country

generally.
DOLACE: The forming of the revolutionary struggle as it were.

COLLINS: Yes. When I eventually went on to do my doctorate in England my
dissertation was on Caribbean politics. The specific focus was Grenada and the political
development of the island between 1950 and 1979. I stopped at 1979 precisely because at
the time that I was doing my dissertation, it was immediately after the traumatic Grenada
events of 1983 and I didn't feel I could handle research into the 1979 to 1983 period. It
was just too painful and confusing. So I stopped just before the revolutionary period and
I didn't deal with the revolution or the invasion or any of that. Basically, in my
dissertation, I just wanted to figure out, how did we get here? Meaning how did Grenada

get here? I can't say that I figured it out but it was interesting going.

JACQUELINE: Well, you know, looking at your work it's obvious that you
haven't figured out the revolution, you still haven't figured out 1983, it seems to me, for

there seems to be, in looking at Ange! for example, something unresolved in that work.

COLLINS: Absolutely. I notice it up here: In my head. It's always something
