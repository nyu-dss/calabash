COLLINS: What I was trying to get at in my second novel The Color of
Forgetting is the way in which blue, Caribbean blue---the blue skies, blue seas, blue
whatever is often constructed as the color of the Caribbean---the place where one goes to

for forgetfulness or “paradise” or that sense of peace and getting away from it all.

DOLACE: So even though the language is a little easier there is the symbolism

being much more difficult in the second novel.

COLLINS: Right! The novel is supposed to show that there’s something more
behind the blue, within it.

JACQUELINE: And how did that novel come about, The Color of Forgetting?

COLLINS: That came about because of a sense of the Caribbean as being
enveloped in a construction of forgetfulness, of the tourist paradise, and even within the
islands themselves, Caribbean people often don’t really appreciate what we have. It’s
also another step towards working out Grenada. It’s part of my sense that we’re so
concerned with constructing things for those who rush to the Caribbean for its

“forgetfulness” quality, so much so that we don’t preserve the things that are important to

our Own spirit.

For example, in The Color of Forgetting, there 1s a scene starting at the top of this
hill and it’s really bush all around. But yet this hill, Leapers’ Hill, is supposed to have
this glorious history because it is the place that Caribs leapt from supposedly to their
deaths on the rocks below in defiance of colonial advancement. That has to represent
something seminal for Grenada. This place where people are leaping to their deaths in
defiance of the colonial invaders rather than be captured. So that’s the image I kind of
wanted to start with. And I wanted to start from that image, to move from that to where

towards the end of the novel you have. . .
DOLACE: The cruise ship passengers?

COLLINS: Right. You have the cruise ship passengers coming in and what that
looks like. There are also other images scattered about at the end of the novel. Because

you also have the monument to a great power, and all of that, but where is the monument
