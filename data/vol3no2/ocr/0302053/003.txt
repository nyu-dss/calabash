Sociology and Economics and all of that. It was really a very exciting time both in terms
of the artistic expression and other things that were going on---politically very formative
forme. At UWI, too, I discovered West Indian literature because they had a course at the
time that was called that - West Indian Literature - and also African Literature. Then I
took courses with Dr. Eddie Baugh on the Victorians. And this was also when Kamau

[Brathwaite] came out with “Islands”, “Rights of Passage” and “Masks.”

Kamau’s work helped some of us to sort out things. I remember hearing Kamau
read “The Dust” at the Creative Arts Center and realizing that there's another voice for
poetry, but still not knowing how I would use that voice in poetic expression. The first
thing that I remember writing on paper, leading me to think of myself as a writer, was
after UWI when I went back to Grenada and there I wrote a short story called “The
Walk.” That was the first time I started to think seriously about the possibility — well,
more about writing than about the possibility of becoming a writer. But I still didn't

know where to go with that interest ---and that was 1975.
JACQUELINE: So, Merle, just clarify some things. You left Grenada what year?

COLLINS: First of all in 1969. I was at Mona between 1969 and 1972. After
completing my first degree, I went back to Grenada, and left in 1974 to teach in St. Lucia.
I returned to Grenada after one year and taught at Mac Donald College in St. Patrick’s
until 1977 or 1978. I ended up leaving Grenada again in 1978. I left because, having
done English and Spanish earlier at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, I
decided that I wanted to do some more with Spanish. Generally, it was an exploratory
period, a period of testing my various interests to figure out which one or which ones I
wanted to settle with. So I went to Mexico, spent six months in Mexico and then came to
the United States because I decided I wanted to do Translation and Interpretation. I
ended up doing a master's in Latin American Studies in addition to a certificate in

Translation at Georgetown University.

DOLACE: In 1979 there were a lot of demonstrations in Grenada. Tell us more

about 1979 and the demonstrations of that period.
