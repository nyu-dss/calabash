Jamaica and this man in Italy saying it’s his mother’s situation exactly! How is that
possible?” And moving on from that to, yes, it 1s entirely possible because in a sense in
so many different ways, our own little thing is a concern for so many other things. The

great human story.

It’s the way in which, for example, talking about the Haitian situation and writing
about Haiti and researching Haiti you might ask why Haiti? And yet in so many ways, as
one of my students was saying recently and I will call her name, Tanya, because it was
her idea, Tanya was saying that as far as Haiti is concerned she chooses as her preferred
term the infinite rehearsal, because all of the things that have happened in Haiti have
happened in one way or the other in various Caribbean countries. The kind of treachery
among leaders, the killings, the repression of the population. .. the invasion, everything.
So it’s like an infinite rehearsal. I think of that little country Grenada---all of those
lessons ever learned there---I think those have been huge lessons for a lot of people
worldwide. In 1983, at the time of the internal political collapse and the invasion, people
talked about Grenada in terms of Czechoslovakia, and the fact that it happened in such a

tiny country doesn’t make it any less huge.
DOLACE: The political actually coming back to the personal.

COLLINS: Yes, yes intensely personal and it’s always there for me to go back to
and try to understand other aspects of myself. For me, working out the story of Grenada

is working out the story of humanity, of myself and my being in the world.

JACQUELINE & DOLACE: Thank you for the interview, Merle.

COLLINS: Thank you so much, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful — thinking through

all these things. Beautiful.
