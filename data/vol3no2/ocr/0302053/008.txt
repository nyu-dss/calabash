the stories that needed to come out.

In fact, what I was researching, in an academic sense, was covering the same
period in Angel. And so it was a lot of voices talking through where we have been, and

that is how Angel came - the characters just tumbling over each other out of my head.

JACQUELINE: I want to know what was it like trying to publish the novel in

that Creole voice and if today you think it was the best thing to do?

COLLINS: At the time it wasn’t so hard to get the novel published in that voice
because it was post-Grenada revolution and the publisher was looking for that kind of
voice from Grenada as well. In fact, Women’s Press [the publisher] had said to me at the
time, that when your book is finished let us see it. So when Angel was finished and I
showed it to them they didn’t hesitate really to publish it. Was it the best thing to do, to
write in that Creole voice? For me, it was the only thing to do at the time. It was the way

I could feel close to my characters and hear them clearly.

DOLACE: Something else interesting happens in Angel---competing ideologies

[are] at work. The whole revolutionary excitement [versus] the reality of people’s lives.

COLLINS: YES - with Angel there are competing political ideologies at various
levels. In the novel there’s an argument between Angel and her mother Doodsie and you
can see where Angel is going with her political theorizing, while Doodsie’s attitudes and
actions are informed by things which are more real because she is dealing with the real
every day thing of what the children have to eat. I am always concerned about those
things. Not always to shout people down because they don’t have what you consider
progressive political views. They are the ones on the ground dealing with their own
issues. It’s not all about what is considered correct in political struggles, sometimes it is

about very pragmatic decisions.

DOLACE: Well, speaking of language and entering into the voice of the
character, by the time we get to the second novel it is more accessible. What I want to
understand the most about the protagonist, Carib, in your second novel, is her enigmatic

phrase “blue is the color of forgetting.”
