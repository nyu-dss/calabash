throwing back her head and guffawing

and turning his mind to origami,

he folds up the parcels neat, neat so

figures out minute change

hums to himself when all it adds up

sticks his pencil at a jaunty angle

relative to his ears

and offers me a paradise sweetie

from a glass jar

before he rags the counter clean

and frowns all hopeful-like to the next customer.

Across by the main road

and a little ways up

(if you pass the rum shop

you too far out),

they building a new mini-market
with everything exact

and pre-package

and name-brand

cause is ample time we Bajans learn
how to suffer change

and to hell —

if I may make free with the devil
and his consortium —

with the dispatch.
