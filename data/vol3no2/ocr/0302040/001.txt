DISPATCH, A SCENE FROM PARADISE LOST

At the village shop,

shifting his weight around

so you could hear

the few grains of rice or scratch-grain
or whatever it was that spill
crunching under his feet,

the owner pits science

against conscience

as he sifts a little extra corn meal,
then sugar for goodness sake

and as a measure of courtesy

on to the scale

(of course that was well before
this latest onslaught of diabetes
begin eating everybody heart
inside out

and trying to desecrate we soul
at the knee joint)...

But getting back to the smell
of cider, lux soap
and pigtail in brine

So how your grandmother, he says,
wiping his hands and letting fall
the wing flap of his white apron

all business minded

and yet sociable like.

I say hearty cause it sound life affirming â€”
sound like if Ma was constantly
