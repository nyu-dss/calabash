for something particular,

as if my soul were something to be flipped over
and deciphered like a map spread flat—

my aunt, for whom the Psalm sent up its balm
like a fire’s whirling spark

over the cancer already altering her veins,

for whom the tambourine shuddered its muse...

She was the first to go and to have said aloud

what this poem does not want to name,

though what she said, at that window under the hill,
would become the fuel that powered my lamp of dreams.
Those firewood days of Beechamville come back

fresh as the moon to an evening stream.
