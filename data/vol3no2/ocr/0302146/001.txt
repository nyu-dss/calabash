LAMPLIGHT

Lampshades, their temples lapped in Home-Sweet-Home,

one for each room, all washed and dried,

wicks trimmed: Jane and Louisa will soon come home,

soon come home; I close my eyes,

passing in memory the high grass weltering in dew,

the ruminating cows in the bright field,

the red hibiscus that softened the cut-stone wall,

that time of day when the crickets break out sawing in the wind
pitched between petal and thorn—My dear,

will you ‘low me to waltz with you?—

I begin here, with my methodical aunt
whose inward eye browsed through me

as through the uncut pages of a book
