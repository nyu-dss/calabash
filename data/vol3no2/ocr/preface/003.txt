really need someone committed to help. Through their dedication and loyalty Calabash is still
alive, all the while becoming a better and more dynamic publication.

I also have to thank Jacqueline Bishop, Gerard Aching, and Michela Calderaro for
sharing their institutional knowledge and generously giving advice about how to make this issue
as fabulous as all the others before it. And finally, Calabash is nothing without the many people
who feel so strongly about the Journal that they remember to check for the next issue and send
their congratulations and expressions of support. I am highly appreciative to work with a Journal
that has such a glorious past and I take comfort in the fact that Calabash has a strong foundation

and strong relationships with its dedicated readers and artists.

Until next time,

Dolace McLean
