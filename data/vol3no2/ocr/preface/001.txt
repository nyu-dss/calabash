Calabash

A JOURNAL OF CARIBBEAN ARTS AND LETTERS Vol 3, Num 2 / Fall-Winter 2005

Dolace McLean

PREFACE
A Tribute To Grenada

If Calabash is to be described with a phrase, I would borrow one from the island of
Jamaica that says “it likkle but it tallawah!” Calabash Journal is indeed “little but it is stalwart,”
marked by a strength of spirit that matches the people for whom it purports to speak. In 2004, the
founding editor invited me to be a guest editor for three issues of Calabash Journal. At first I
hesitated because such a position with a small but reputable publication is fraught with
challenges, yet, instinctively, I knew that I would accept simply because Calabash is a publication
in which I deeply believe. Despite the many demands of getting Calabash to print, the Journal
refuses to die, or more properly speaking, it entices us to share in the magical splendor of
Caribbean arts and literature that it has yet to reveal to its many loyal readers around the globe.

The summer of 2005 has been a crucial time of transition for our hardy little Calabash.
With ambitious plans for a splashy July publication in homage to the equally hardy island of
Grenada, our hopes were dashed when we were forced to find replacement personnel within a
limited time span. As a Journal dedicated to a resilient people however, we decided that we

would conquer disappointment with a renewed commitment to the excellence of our publication.
