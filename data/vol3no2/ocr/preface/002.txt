Knowing that what we do is of value to the Caribbean community both within the region and
without, we redoubled our efforts to make this issue a strong one.

Grenada, the spice isle is our feature attraction for this issue. Grenada was one of the
islands hardest hit by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, and battered for a second time less than a year later
by Hurricane Frances. Given such cataclysmic events, Calabash was determined to present this
issue as a tribute to the people of the spice isle and their varied and interesting lives on the trio of
islands that include Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique.

Merle Collins sat with Jacqueline Bishop and me, Dolace McLean, one weekend in May
to try to address the events of 1983 and the political trauma that preceded the American invasion.
Suelin Low Chew Tung and Susan Mains offered articles about the thriving art scene. Jacob
Ross and Maureen Roberts, both resident in England, shared with us the beauty of their poetry
and prose. Donald Hill, an African-American scholar who specializes in the music and culture of
Grenada, presented some of the cultural forms that inform the lives of ordinary Carriacouans.
Eric Johnn, Grenadian and resident New York artist, gave an overview of three wonderful
Grenadian artists including the world-famous Canute Calliste. The Historical Society of
Carriacou operated by Clemencia Alexander, the daughter of Canute Calliste, generously gave
permission for us to use some of the images of the great artist. To Clemencia and the Historical
Society, Calabash is truly thankful.

Despite the strength of the journal and my faith in its intrinsic value to the Caribbean
community, however, there are people without whom this issue could never have come into
being. I am grateful to the dedicated members of the editorial staff who embody the spirit of
tenacity. I am deeply indebted to Trevor Peters who has proved to be an energetic and
indefatigable managing editor, getting things done, sometimes only by sheer force of will. Sassy
Ross, like her name, brings a vivacious commitment to the success of the Journal as our new
marketing editor and all-around copywriter and proofreader. Min Weng is the newest member of

our team who brings all his strong Internet publishing skills to the Journal at a time when we
