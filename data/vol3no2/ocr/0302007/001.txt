BETSY

Translated by Susan Massotty

(AN EXCERPT FROM THE QUEEN OF PARAMARIBO)

The Buick slowly inched its way through the crowd. People only moved over
when the car was practically on top of them. Anonymous faces peered in, hoping to catch
a glimpse of the passenger. Betsy listened with satisfaction and pride to the cries of
admiration that reached her in snatches through the rolled-down window. She wrapped
her fingers tightly around the jade handle of her feather fan — all her tension seemed to be
concentrated in her hands. The fan provided a welcome breeze on this hot and sultry
April evening. The usual wind wasn’t blowing in from the Surinam River, and the
oppressive heat had driven people out of their houses. They swarmed over the road like
ants on an anthill.

She had been looking forward to this evening for months. The birthday of Crown
Princess Juliana was going to be celebrated in style — dancers were even coming from the

Demerara!
