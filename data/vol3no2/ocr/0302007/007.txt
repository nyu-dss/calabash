she hasn’t got an ounce of style...” With this, Betsy flounced into the room.

She wove her way across the crowded dance floor to her usual place near the
stage, stopping occasionally to greet an acquaintance, chat with a friend, acknowledge a
compliment on her dress. When she realized that Maxi Linder and her two companions
were seated at the next table, she bit her lip so hard that it bled. While the bitter taste of
blood spread through her mouth, she pointedly moved her chair as far away from them as
she could.

Maxi Linder retaliated with a loud chuckle. Then she turned to the officer on her
left and cooed, “Darling, let me have a sip from your glass.”

“No, honey. Tonight ’?m gonna take a sip out of yours,” the officer replied.
Nevertheless, he offered her his glass.

While she drank, he playfully pinched her waist. She squealed and pulled away as
if she’d been bit by a mosquito. Then, laughing uproariously, she threw her arms around
his neck. Once again, Maxi had managed to make herself the center of attention.

“Tell me, what’s your opinion of that demonstration that took place down on
Orange Square?” said Betsy to the man sitting next to her, in hopes of distracting him
from Maxi Linder and her cheap tricks. It was a Dutch man in a dark suit with a garish
bow tie. “I don’t think Pve ever seen so many Javanese and Indian contract laborers
together in one place,” she continued.

“T didn’t see it myself, but I read about it in today’s paper. That Communist, De
Kom, has got the workers all riled up. You’ve got to keep your eye on people like that —
before you know it, they’ll have the entire population up in arms against the
government,” the man said.

“Do you think it'll come to that?” someone else asked.
