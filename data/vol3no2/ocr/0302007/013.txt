incident with Maxi Linder that she hadn’t even seen him coming. He swept off his hat
with a flourish and bowed deeply.

She couldn’t help noticing how incredibly broad-shouldered he looked in his
impeccable dark-gray Grimaldi-stripe suit. The waistband, held in place by wide
suspenders, came up to his chest. His skin was the color of ripe bananas, and the thin,
clipped moustache on his upper lip gave his pointy face the look of a predatory animal,
an impression that was reinforced when he curled his fleshy lips into a cunning smile and
revealed a row of gold teeth...

“Who was that gal you was jes talkin’ to?” he asked in beyan, the heavily
accented English of the Caribbean. Before she could even answer, he added, “I love them
wild gals...!”

He gently pushed her towards the dance floor, which in the meantime had been
cleared of people. The musicians upped the tempo. The firm pressure of his right arm
around her waist and the intertwining of their fingers made Betsy forget the time and the
place. Their bodies flowed rhythmically together in one motion. As if drawn by an
enormous magnet, her pelvis pressed against his. Effortlessly, she followed his steps.
Flawlessly, she made his tempo her own. The music surged through her veins. As if in a
trance, she saw the room whirling around her...

The loud applause brought her back to reality.

“Tell me, before we start the next dance. Do you have any plans for tonight?”

She could see by the rise and fall of his chest that he was having trouble
controlling his breathing. There was a sheen of perspiration on the yellowish skin of his
face.

“T have to dance tonight.”
