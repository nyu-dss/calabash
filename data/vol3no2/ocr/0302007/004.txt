majestic nod. The crowd held its breath.

For one second you could have heard a pin drop. Then the silence was broken.
“Wow, what a dress! She sure is beautiful!”

“T’ve never seen a dress like that. There must be at least a thousand beads...!”

“Hey, she’s wearing gold shoes!”

There was a buzz of admiration. Those shoes had cost an arm and a leg. A whole
seventeen guilders and fifty cents. And that was nothing compared to the dress, which
was actually two dresses worn on top of each other. The under garment was made of gold
satin, and the tunic that went over it was studded with colored beads. The entire outfit had
cost a hundred guilders, but Mr. Fernandes had let her buy it on credit. When she’d heard
the price, she had wailed, “But for that amount of money I could buy a building lot!

“Betsy,” he’d replied, “that dress is made for you. You’re going to look fantastic.
Try it on.”

One look in the mirror and she was sold. “Ill pay you every last penny, even if
I’ve got to dance my feet off.”

“Seeing you dazzle them in that dress on your big evening is all that matters to
me. The money’ll sort itself out.” His eyes unashamedly followed the contours of her
body.

“You mean you’re coming?” she asked in mock surprise.

“Of course. I wouldn’t miss it for the world! I want to see the look on their faces
when you make your entrance in that dress. They’ll be begging you to dance. Who
knows, maybe I won’t even get a turn.”

“Don’t worry, you won’t be left on the sidelines as long as I’m around, especially

not now.” And with a tingle of excitement, she had held up the gold dress.
