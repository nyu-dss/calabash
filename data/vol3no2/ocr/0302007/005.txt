“Why, she could be a crown princess!” exclaimed a heavy-set man standing a few feet
away.

“A Halikibe princess, you mean” replied an older woman with a face full of warts.

“Halikibe Princess!!” shouted someone else in apparent approval. The cry was
taken up and echoed by the crowd: “Halikibe Princess! Halikibe Princess...!!”

Betsy reveled in the success brought on by her dress. The gold silk scarf holding
her curls in place presumably added to her royal image. Halikibe Princess — she liked the
name. From now on, that’s what she would call herself.

Clutching her purse firmly under her arm, she strode to the entrance with her head
held high. Snatches of music from Buddel’s band drifted over the stone wall around the
dance hall. Inside, things were already in full swing, with various couples doing a fiery
rumba. Outside, the mob around the door pressed forward to get a better look at what was
going on inside. Other people were simply enjoying their evening out — chatting with
friends or buying food and drinks from the refreshment stands along the river.

Betsy had almost reached the entrance when Maxi Linder, accompanied by two
naval officers, cut in front of her. Maxi spit demonstratively on the sand and rolled her
eyes in Betsy’s direction. She was covered from head to toe in gold jewelry. Too bad it
clashed with the tacky dress she had on. What’s more, her hair had been swept up in a
ridiculous roll on top of her head, and she wasn’t wearing a bit of make-up.

Since Maxi Linder and her party were blocking the doorway, Betsy had no choice
but to wait. With Maxi on the scene, the public had lost all interest in Betsy.

“You’re beautiful, baby!” a man called.

Maxi grinned and blew him a kiss.
