BOY COUSIN

Who loved at eight to canter ‘round the yard

astride a molting broomstick

until he disappeared behind his parents’ back

through the forbidden gate

to where the loosening zinc fence rattled

in the wind like an old fan,

his young horns bent

on the live current of the street.

Just kids. But their fierce bonding

and rude regard for The Law
