the blade, in that world from which neither luck

nor prayer could pull him back.

Now he was one

of the children of Sisyphus.

And now, as when a stone is lifted

setting the ants scampering,

what claimed his imagination wrecked the street.

To defeat the godless foe, his parents moved,

leaving behind the house that soon could not be left

to anyone—no door anymore, no key—

and that was how I knew (before on thing

led to another) why they sent him to Bensonton

in the garden parish, to walk among the trees.
