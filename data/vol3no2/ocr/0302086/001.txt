FOR THE GIRLS

Who will stop our daughters from eating the food of misery
Who will tell them that locked closets may imprison living souls

That if a man touches a girl-child, she did not make him do it?

Who will show our daughters that fatherless children suffer quietly

Who will tell them that being on their feet means staying off their backs

That if a man whispers sweet nothings, he may have nothing else to offer?

Who will save our daughters from the rage of their tormented womenfolk
Who will tell them that a motherâ€™s love sometimes speaks though angry lips

That if a man decides your destiny, you teach your girl-child not to dream?

Who will show our daughters to pry their boy children away from their skirts
Who will tell them that raising a boy means letting him learn to be a man

That if your son thinks you are his wife, he will think his wife is his mother?
