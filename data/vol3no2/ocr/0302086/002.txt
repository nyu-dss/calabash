Who will stop our daughters from grabbing for the scraps left under the table
Who will tell them that their greatest power is not hinged between their thighs

That if a man leaves dirt on his marriage bed, then let him sleep on the floor?

Who will stop our daughters from storing their childrenâ€™s future in unsafe places

Who will tell them that the sins of the fathers will keep coming back

That if a child is left holding the pain, generations will be cursed by the legacy?
