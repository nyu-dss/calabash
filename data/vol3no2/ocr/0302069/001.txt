NOTES ABOUT THE MOON MY FAVORITE
STELLAR BODY OF THE MOMENT IN HALF
TRANSLATION

luna large circle in the sky sometimes, sometimes a banana, sometimes just nothing
lunes feast day for the moon goddess, first day of the work week
lunares literally small brown (or black) moons on your face
luna llena when the moon looks like a cheesecake
cambiar de luna change moods/moons
lunatico crazy maybe because of the lunar cycle (lycanthropy is also blamed on the
moon)
estar en la luna to daydream about the moon?; to be out of it
cara de luna llena a face that’s full like a baby doll with a porcelain head, big cheeks,
tiny lips
pedir la luna to ask for the moon; you can’t have it but you can have a helium balloon
which also

floats in the sky; you can videotape yourself in the desert and say you have

the moon
