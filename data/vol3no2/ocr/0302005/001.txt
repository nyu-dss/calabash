COLOR OF LOVE

-- for the rainforest of Grande Riviere, Trinidad

Who would have thought
that when she thought
of the color of love,

sheâ€™d have thought of the color green?

Not the brilliant, frolicsome green that lavished itself on almond trees in the early

morning sun.

Nor a vigorous, composed green

layering its coolness on roadside shrubs after sudden afternoon rains.

Neither was it a green of young,

betraying unripened fruit.

When she thought of love, it was of a mossy green,

quietly emergent, along the periphery of land-locked stone,

attaching its foreign, slippery essence to rock bodies submerged deep in muddy waters,
sneaking into the tiniest of crevices,

shrewd and able as it holds fast,
