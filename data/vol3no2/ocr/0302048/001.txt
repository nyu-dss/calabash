THE HOME LIBERATION FRONT

In New York,

Bajan

Jamaican

St. Lucian

Guyanese
(I could go on)

never have more spirit

than when they laugh

in some natural-born Americanâ€™s face
about going home.

Bus-stop, supermarket

train station

and once

even while I was watching
my goddaughter play

at the jungle gym

over there-so on Avenue N...

We are not just
passing the time then.

You would think we had sojourn

in Egypt
for so-many-and-so-many
desolate years
