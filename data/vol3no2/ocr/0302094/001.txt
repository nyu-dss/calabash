Calabash

A JOURNAL OF CARIBBEAN ARTS AND LETTERS

Black earthed grit
smears the darling
beauty of Red Dirt
Girl who dwells

in the Public Domain
of David Rudderâ€™ s
Hammer. But

maybe one day

She will emerge into
a fantasy of cool
summer suns; for
now, she resides in the
hot blue mooned
memories of forgotten

Carib warriors.
