THREE HAIKU FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS WHO
ARE TOO DEEP FOR OUR OWN DAMN GOOD

On rainy days waves
Make a mad dash for the shore,

Crash and then recede.

We are foolish waves.
Rain impels us to move too

Fast, collide with rocks
Struggle through seaweeds

That tangle at our feet and

Pull us down too deep.
