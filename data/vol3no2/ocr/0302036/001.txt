Calabash

A JOURNAL OF CARIBBEAN ARTS AND LETTERS

Walk into the yard

nigh on two

in the morning.

In this season

of the witch

and under a calabash moon
remember the old woman
whose house

you used to walk

forty yards

out of you way

to shun?

Well the shed

is hipshot now

and she has long since
performed

her last exequies

for the bone-man.

So what it is
you so frighten for now?

That the crapaud

with the night

down deep

in its throat

might husk and cough
like a man?
