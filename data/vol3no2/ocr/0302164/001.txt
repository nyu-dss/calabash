SLOW DOWN FREIGHT TRAIN

In summer the days are long and the body stretches out like it’s a plant trying to
reach the sun. Everybody looks taller in summer some wider too, and the streets begin to
come alive. There’s a different buzz to a summer street. Happiness and hope singing

itself in the air like a be bop, skitter-skatter jazz shy melody.

The girls start wearing colours like cotton candy pink, fresh corn yellow, mint
green, peachy peach, and baby powder blue. I wear red like a beacon to challenge the
sun. It aint’ no winter colour really, even if the girls look good in it then too. No, red is
for those long elastic summer days when you can sit in the yard, or hang out with the
guys at the barber’s and feel like you might... just might... touch the sky. Achieve some

wild, secret dream. Do the thing that’s not done that’s closest to your heart.

In the late evenings it’s kinda nice to sit by the little pond. The one that no one
knows is there ‘cos it’s kinda hidden now with all the buildings that grew up around
it. You can smell Away from there. I mean those far Away places your imagination drifts
into when you’re watching TV. or listening to good jazz, or a soulful Bessie. You can

look into that dark-skinned-sky and see cities far away. Catch a melody on a breeze.

Summer, that’s when my heart’s pumping and I’m ready to go. A person shouldn’t really
