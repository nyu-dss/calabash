stay put when the air is warm and smelling like flowers. Even if it’s only the flowers

sitting outside on the sidewalk of some convenience store.

I can stretch my neck, close my eyes and see corn fields swaying, melons
ripening, firm and plump: fruits ready for picking. I mean those squishy-squashy summer

fruits; that come in pastel or bright, ‘pick-a-colour-and-chew’ shades.

Perhaps it’s the trains, who know what’s on those thunder-clanking
trucks. Mainly you just smell the dark smoke, thick and greasy like rich gravy. You can
taste it too, sticky- slick on your tongue mixed with that burning metal, iron grinding on
iron taste. It floats into your throat, sticking to your gullet waiting for cold, ice cold,

swift flowing beer to clean it out. The way you pour Drano down clogged pipes.

Maybe one day I’m gonna slow down one of those old trains. Stand in front of
the engine with my elongated summer arms stretched wide, stretched wide and red in my
favourite red shirt. Then I’m gonna jump on that train, sit on top of a pile of something

good going to some market somewhere and deliver myself.

Perhaps it’s just that crazy wind that’s not blowing, that’s putting thoughts into
my head. What do I care, I can sit here and wait for those trains, wait for the night train

before I get up and go.
