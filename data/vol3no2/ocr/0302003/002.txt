look shinier still when he laugh

And sister look up to ‘de sky and see a spattering of stars and ’de moon nearly full;
and close picture-book

Brother find record player and old Bob Marley album and play Rat Race

Mamma light candle and draw curtain

Curtains start to look different with light behind it--pink get soft like cotton,
green look like sea water, and blue look like sunny sky

A neighbor man run an extension chord from his house to his yard, hang a bulb
over an old wood table and spread out a set of dominoes on top

Whole village start to show light

Lamp light,

Porch light,

Flash light in hand, lighting dark road in front of walk to neighbor yard

A neighbor woman start to laugh light, light, like a man say something to she, she
can’t repeat

It was night, so it was light

Island light

Home for the night light

Man whispering to woman light

Child teasing child ‘bout daytime, schoolyard game light

Extension chord attached to hanging bulb over old wood tables with dominoes, cards,
and checkerboards light

Bob Marley, Short Shirt, King Obstinate, Charlie Pride, old-time calypso light

Home from ‘de week doing live-in maid job light

It was night, so it was light carried like electric current throughout the night in the small
village...

Tonight, Saturday night

Bolans was dark but it was light, real light

Free from the rest of Antigua light

Free to be a small, old town, with dark, ancient people light

Reaching towards something remembered in between the despair of Island dark
Dancing sparks carried from house to house, porch to porch, yard to yard

A stereo blasts out Redemption Song, “Oh Pirates, yes they rob I...”

And people get light with song, with smiles, with tears, and say “play that one again,
Sahl...”

It was night. Island night.
For a few moments, dark and light danced so sweet and light
