NIGHT LIGHT
(Ode to Bolans Village, Antigua —‘Home’)

It was night, so it was dark.

Island dark

Bodies shades of dark

Dark of pure, unadulterated legacy from the earliest thoughts, arts, struggles
Dark of mixed ideas, sciences, faiths, romances

Dark lightened to a hue fashioned by imperialistic subjugation

It was night, so it was dark
Island dark

Black pepper, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla bean, cocoa bark dark

Pot “bun”, pegao, burnt crust dark
Mamma hand turn stew round, throw-little-sauce-in-palm-of-hand-and-taste,
add-more-spice-till-food-taste-like-‘de-cook- hand-good-tonight dark

Daddy say fish sale no too good today, dark

Brother say can’t get work no matter how much he try dark

Aunty say she pregnant again and can’t self pay she first child school fees dark
Sister looking ‘pon American picture-book and want dress, shoes, bag in new
color dark

Granpappa say he get good joke by rum shop today

Make him laugh

Mamma, daddy, brother, aunty, sister, young child who shouldn’t understand
joke all start to laugh

What a laugh!

Mamma say she shouldn’t laugh

“De joke directly too devilish,” too dark...

It was night, so it was dark

Island dark
A car pass and shed light on ‘de porch and Granda shiny silver teeth in his mouth
