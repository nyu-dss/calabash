She left that day and I remember the sky was gray, reflecting the sadness that
stained the air. The clouds were moving fast as if they were in a hurry to speed up time,
so that the rain could fall soon. I remember thinking that the rain, soon to fall, would stop
her from leaving, but I should have known that nothing would stop her. Nothing could.
The rain fell and she took the plum colored suitcase and her black umbrella and walked
slowly in the rain, on the rocky road that she fell on when she was a child and busted her
lip. I remember too, ‘cause it bled so badly, she cried for days. She walked like a slow-
motioned figure. I thought that she might not want to go, but yet I knew better. She
wanted to go. She had to go.

She left that day and no one has heard her voice since. She writes sporadic letters
to her mother, who yearns for words, lots of words to compensate for not hearing her
voice. She speaks of her health. She speaks of the weather. She won’t be coming back. I
know this. We all know this. But we stay. We stay because this is the only home that we
know, that we want to know. She left never to return, ‘cause she said her world was too
small and the world out there was too big. So she has gone to re-create her world. She has
gone to become again. I have always wondered how? How do you become again? How
do you make small big? I do not know. She will discover the answers, I hope, and maybe
she will be who she desires to be, and happiness, her happiness will be claimed, because

in the house, on the rocky road, it did not dwell.
