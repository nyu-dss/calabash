GONE

She left never to return. She said that she had to go, because freedom could not be
claimed there in that house. No, not in that house, she said! She lived her entire life in
that house. The house knew more about her than anyone in her life ever did. That’s why
when she left she knew she could leave without feeling sadness over having left, because

she knew the house understood.

She left to go everywhere. The world was too big she claimed, too big, to live
such a small existence. So she said goodbye to the house, to Nana and Papa, Libby, Rayla
and Gorlon. She said goodbye and she knew she would never return. When she was
leaving, she entered every room in the house. She spoke to each room as if they were
each individuals, because each room, in the years she had lived there, had seen different
aspects of who she was. Each room had become like a familiar “friend”. She said
goodbye to each “friend” that day. The blue room, the green room and the room the color
of puke were her favorites. She took her suitcase, worn plum colored and old as it could
ever seem to be. It was the same suitcase her momma used years before when she was a
little girl, to runaway to a place, any place faraway, to escape the wrath of her daddy who
didn’t know what to do with his built up rage. She didn’t run far though, ‘cause her daddy
caught her, by the collar, just as she was about to step her tiny left foot out the front door.

Her momma never tried to leave again.
