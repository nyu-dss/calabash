BAS' PANDAY, COOLIE PRIME MINISTER

I watched it on the news

OnelI thought I'd never see
One to make the world uneasy
Uncomfortable with our views

Trinidad of ethnic fears

I saw, I felt, I lived it myself
Truths accumulate on a shelf
Dusty with the brown mans fears

But why this tribal unity?

East Indians speak in Creole
Whisper, “Himis not we people!”
My accent gave me away

I wrote, cajoled, protested, paid the price
Not even sibling-victims did me a turn
When spurned by the academy, I yearned
For a little thanks, some rice with spice

Bas who persisted against all political charges
Was everyman, and every laborer’ s brother
Raised up now, Prime Minister

He excludes me, gives marching orders
