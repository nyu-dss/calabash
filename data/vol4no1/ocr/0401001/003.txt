And yet, the works presented in this issue are a mere sampling of unique
Caribbean talents that are yet to be exposed. In highlighting the work of women artists
from different lingual communities, it is the hope of the Journal that the creativity of the
region will inspire closer study to unearth the cultural treasures of the region even as

they continue to enrich the history of humanity.

Until next time,
