“AND THE EXCITEMENT CONTINUES...”

Just when we thought that it was almost impossible to get any better, Calabash is
pleased and proud to welcome our latest addition to the editorial board. Tiphanie
Yanique Galiber is a native of the United States Virgin Islands who was educated at
Tufts University, and received a Masters Degree in Creative Writing from the prestigious
creative writing program at the University of Houston. With many accolades under her
belt, Calabash is grateful that she has chosen to join our team us as the book review
editor.

Tiphanie will have her work cut out for her because the literature of the
Caribbean keeps growing by leaps and bounds and indeed, for this issue, Calabash
received a series of fascinating submissions both in the fiction and non-fiction categories
that testify to the ongoing creative and critical abilities of Caribbean people. The
amazing pieces eventually selected include a superb collection of poetry, prose, non-
fiction and fiction pieces from literary and scholarly luminaries suchas Zee Edgell, Cyril
Dabydeen and Ellen Ombre, and writers from places as diverse as South Africa, Belize,

Trinidad and Canada.
