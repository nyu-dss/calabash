The editorial board was fortunate enough to read submissions froma broad range
of writers and visual artists whose passion for and dedication to their work emanate
froma deep-connection with the unique cultural bridge that is the Caribbean. The
Caribbean physically links two continents but socially and historically it has been the
meeting place of various multi-cultural strains that have shaped the social terrain of this
unique part of the world. In honor to that cultural mélange, the editors have worked
diligently to incorporate pieces that reflect the presence of various diasporic groups such
as Middle Eastern, East Indian, Asian and Jewish settlers as a firm part of Caribbean
culture.

Also included in this edition is a strong emphasis on images and essays by and
about Caribbean women from places like Haiti, Suriname and Jamaica. Our feature
article is a piece on Anna Ruth Henriques whose absolutely beautiful creations are as
complex and multi-layered as the artist herself. With a rich analysis provided by Diana
Cooper-Clark of York University in Canada, and also of Jamaican background, the
feature presents the works of Anna Ruth, the artist who celebrates her rich heritage as a
source of inspiration for her stunning tmages.

In addition, from the Dutch West Indies we have images and an “interpretive
essay” by the artist Kit-Lig Tjon Pian Gi whose writing incorporates reflection, history,
cultural observation and poetry to showcase the influences that have shaped her art
while living and working in Suriname, a country witha turbulent political history after
Independence from the Netherlands. In writing across and within genres, as it were, Kit-
Ling’s essay becomes a work of art itself. She is not alone, however, in the ability to
dazzle us with her fascinating creations since all the contributions in this edition are

beautiful works of art lovingly bestowed upon us as privileged viewers and readers.
