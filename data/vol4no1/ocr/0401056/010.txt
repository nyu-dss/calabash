hear the voices of others. Madness moves in when one is not heard and slowly loses her
own voice. In a world ruled by the Internet and digital media, where flow of
communication is based on satellites and cellular phones, the voice of the Soul is lost,
silenced. In a small country, a beautiful island visited by transatlantic ships and
thousands of wealthy tourists staying in international hotel chains, neither Latin, nor
American or European, surrounded by the sea, the social realities of a Caribbean artist
become more and more visible in Osaira’s work. She writes “ if the heritage, the culture, the
system you live in doesn’t work, you have to make a new culture, your own culture.” After living in
Aruba for a week, one realizes that it is a small community; away from the rest of the art
world. Osaira therefore, through her work, including her involvement at Eterno Galleries,
tries to break the silence and awaken the sleeping hearts and minds of all those around
her. For she believes that indifference is unacceptable. Osaira states that “everyday she can
leave the island and plug into see what’s happening, but an awareness of art needs to be developed and

maintained in Aruba.” So, she remains. For she believes truly that “every day, art is a mission in

Aruba, you have to have art in life.” In 1999, for the “New Self Portrait” exhibit at the Institute
of Culture, she creates a sculpture titled “Seven Days a Week.” The work consists of
alternate mousetraps representing entrapment, and small pink birdcages with open
doors representing freedom; seven items for seven days of the week. The artist is telling
her audience that freedom and entrapment exists within us; each and every day of the
week. Without entrapment, there is no value to freedom, it cannot be understood. With
freedom, comes a certain entrapment. Nothing in life is certain, all is a compromise. A
beautiful sunny island, where tourists flock by the thousands to have fun; is it a cage for
an artist? An artist in a big city without the sun and her roots; is it freedom?

Osaira Muyale was selected to exhibit at “Arte 99: Identity, Yesterday, Today and
Tomorrow,” in Willemstad, Curacao. The art exhibition was part of the Dutch

Caribbean Islands commemoration of 500 years of written history. Osaira was awarded

the Grand Prize for “Illusion,” a mixed media installation for “an emotionally moving,
introspective, fresh and poetic installation which combines simplicity of traditional ritual with the

complexity of post-modern techniques such as performance and video.”* The installation consisted
of a magnificent wedding gown; the artist’s, raised on stilts, which the visitor could walk

in and view a video. Inside the gown, the floor was covered with Osaira’s wedding
