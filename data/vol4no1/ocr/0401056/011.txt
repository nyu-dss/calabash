pictures and in the chest of the gown, a television set was embedded, the video showed

Osaira’s slow parachute descent from the skies of Aruba, free as a bird. In the text that
accompanied the work, Osaira spoke to her audience from the heart; “...this is my wedding
dress you can step into, with wedding pictures on the floor, a contemporary look into the reality of my life,
and perhaps yours...my chest is where I can feel my heart and soul..that’s where the video sits..in this
work, everyone can walk on my past, for that is why ‘it is the past’ that’s why the word exists...and we are

allfree.”” During a discussion with Osaira about this work, she stated that, she wanted to
jump out of the illusion completely, and continue to fly. To her, the illusion surrounded
her island and could only be healed with effort and time. For her, the subject matter was
personal and the fairy tale that she was brought up to believe was not real. From a
personal perspective, “Illusion” was healing to her, and encouraging to the public in
facing their own personal illusions in life. Osaira’s use of materials from her own personal
life and elements of memory resulted in making herself so vulnerable as an artist that her
work reflected her humanity and engaged the audience in a uniquely meaningful way.
The poetry of the work laid in simplicity of the idea combined with the high standard of
effort in contemporary technique. In the text that accompanied “Illusion,” Osaira also

stated that “one may determine a culture based on the art that is created at that moment..., and that art

is so important for a country, for through art, one can understand the society..."° The tail of her
wedding gown was 6 feet long, spread wide across the gallery floor, on it she wrote in red

paint “ toa new life..to a new understanding..to a new freedom...” On the 500 commemoration of
the Dutch Caribbean Islands, Osaira Muyale, was exhibiting a work that suggested the
examination of past, understanding of current reality and change for the future. The
theme of the exhibition was “Identity, Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow,” and Osaira’s work
demanded that an identity that is defined only by honest self-examination could only
result in personal freedom. The exhibition opening received 1500 visitor’s and before it
closed within a month, almost 12,000 visitors came to see the exhibit, including H.R.H.
Queen Beatrix of Netherlands whom Osaira gave a tour of the installation wearing a
white dress with one red, and one white shoe.

Osaira Muyale participated in the Watamula International Artists Workshop
and Exhibition in Curacao, September - October of 2000. There were total of 12

international and 12 local artists and the site was an eighteenth century plantation. For
