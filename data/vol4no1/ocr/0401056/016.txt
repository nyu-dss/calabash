universe where she speaks in a symbolic language which we call her art. This art is
moving, challenging, different but it smells of life and can be all consuming. Whether the
context at hand is social, historical or political, Osaira keeps reminding us that her work
is personal; for she believes in the power of the individual. All changes begin at an
individual level and importance of Osaira Muyale’s work comes from it’s constantly
piercing the comfort bubble of the audience. For the artist-individual that is Osaira
Muyale, indifference is unacceptable. She believes that if we listen to voice within, we
hear our intuition, the voice of our Soul. This intuition, will not let us be indifferent to
the suffering and exile of others. For an individual to be in exile, they do not have to be
away from their home; they just have to feel marginalized within their society. Osaira
hears and sees those who are in the margins and her work reflects this sense of social
sensitivity. For she herself suffers from personal exile; and in the end, what is personal is
universal; and what is universal is very much personal. For Osaira, the power to
communicate and change relies within the individual, and with each work that she

presents, she reminds us that we are all one and the same.
