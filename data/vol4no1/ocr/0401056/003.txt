then by her family and at the end by the greater society. This may certainly sound archaic
to American readers, but such is the tradition and although it may not seem present; it is
the unspoken truth. In her adolescence, Osaira saw the reality around her and naturally
rebelled. The wild child grew up to be a striking, feisty young woman. As it is also the
tradition, she left for school in the United States. Yet, after completing her studies, upon
returning to Aruba at age 20, Osaira accepted the hand of marriage to son of an
influential and conservative family of Aruba.

She became pregnant to her first son Benoit soon alter. She could feel the baby in
her belly and hear his heartbeat. She painted watercolor and gouaches paintings where
she drew ears in the shape of a fetus; she was listening to her child. Benoit was born in
1987. But this theme of the eggs remained with Osaira. She continued to draw and paint.
Teardrops around the fetus now surrounded the eggs. Osaira was a good wife and a good
mother, however, she could not repress the yearning neither could she quieten her soul.
She started attending the Rietvield Arts Academy workshops organized by the Aruban
Institute of Culture, including Atelier ‘89. She gave herself to studying fine arts and the
works of other artists; mainly that of women artists such as Louise Bourgeois. She
realized that the reaction to anger and happiness was somewhat the same in all people.
The sculpture “External Milk” was created after her second son, Dominique was born in
1995; one big breast made of plaster, surrounded by other smaller animal breasts,
surrounded by small pieces of black and white paper, on them poems and scenes from
bible. Imagine, under the breast, like a cave, flowers, she called this little cave her
“garden,” and on the inside a guardian angel is coming down, a symbol of magical realism.
She wanted to give children all that she had and nurture them; but she needed her own
space, her garden. She adored her babies and nurtured them yet she felt that she lost
herself and turned into a “one big suckling breast.” From the depth of her being, she
heard a voice and created a space for herself. She felt that to love was to sacrifice. Both
her sons were born with a cesarean birth and she suffered from post-partum depression.
After studying with Rietveld Kunst Akademie workshops organized by Elvis Lopez and
the Aruban Institute of Culture through 1988-1990, Osaira attended Rietveld Kunst
Akademie in Amsterdam. After spending time Holland, she was unhappy remaining

away from her island. It is said that once one lives in the Caribbean, the sun makes you
