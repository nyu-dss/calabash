Osaira, working, staying, and living in this location, the Lagun and Landhouse Knibp site,
was particularly challenging. In the past, this is where the slaves lived, suffered, died and
were forgotten. She could sense their presence, hear their silent suffering and feel their
tears. In the year 2000, the site was a combination of uncultivated and farmed land
known as “cunucu,” meaning countryside, which offered possibilities of site-specific
installation work. Osaira sensed that the conservative islanders and the Dutch preferred
to live in Curacao; for the power structure of the island lent itself to the practices of the
old ways and the old world. She felt that although 90% of the island was of African
descent due to centuries of slave trade, they weren’t free enough and did not receive the
same privileges as those who were of European descent. Living in the small chambers of
the slaves, in the excruciating heat, only fueled her identification with those who
suffered in the past, and those who were suffering in the new millennium. Freedom for
Osaira, came through self-examination and discovery; which manifested itself in the
process and delivery of her work.

The process began by walking in the wild, and Osaira discovered an abandoned
house and started taking photographs of it. She looked for the owner and when she
finally found him; he wasn’t interested in meeting her. She then started writing poetry in
Papiamento on the house and she painted the house. She made a kite and tied it to the
house. She continued to write about what was it like to live in the Lagun, attracting
attention so that all who lived around there could read it, she called it the “Neighbors.”
During her walks in nature, she came across a pool where the slaves used to dye their
clothes with indigo blue. She also saw an abandoned water tank, next to it a photo
camera and condoms. Upon developing the film in the camera, she discovered that the

camera told the story of a black and white gay couple that visited Aruba and Curacao on

their honeymoon. She felt that their life crossed path with hers and she was “bound

together by fate and by this location with all its historical connotations.” She then started cleaning
the reservoir and met with Sharlon, a native of Curacao, who helped her. They become
friends and exchanged memories. Osaira documented these memories as they worked
and ate together. She also spent time with Wilson, a Columbian artist, whose artwork
she truly loved. Sharlon was strong, heterosexual, black; Wilson, brave, homosexual,

white. Osaira was looking at the pictures she found; a racially mixed couple; to her, the
