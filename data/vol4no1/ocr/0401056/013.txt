story was unfolding to her like a film. She proposed a ritual to Sharlon and Wilson. They
agreed. The piece “Bathing me, Bathing you,”(1) was a site-specific multi-media
performance installation that was later exhibited to the public on film lasting 37 minutes.
It was taped at night at 3 a.m. with other artists as the audience. Ryan Oduber another
Aruban artist was responsible for the sound. The name of the piece referred to the ritual
of cleansing each other in the blue reservoir that was used by so many slaves in the
colonial past of the Caribbean. Osaira, Sharlon and Wilson each had blue indigo tablets
in their hands, with them, they started writing on the walls surrounding the reservoir.
The first one to write was Wilson, he said “I am scared...” in a sense they voiced the fears
of those that came before them, for this environment where history and architecture
became a catalyst for truth, was too intense to process with anything but simple truth.
The pool was filled with water and Osaira, as the female, stepped into a pool with blue

For Osaira, the water was an element that would soothe the past and help wash away
the pain. There they started washing each other, slowly fear was lifted. Water is the
symbol of compassion and love and in Watamula, after she submerged herself in indigo
blue water, Osaira rose accepting herself once again a new person and announced the
final portion of her performance; her declaration of love for all mankind and _ her
engagement of love-making with Sharlon, her black friend from Curacao. She wanted to
give a message to all to break the oppression, in the very same pool where the oppressed
washed their clothes with someone who was still oppressed, by loving him

unconditionally.

The national slogan of Aruba is “One Happy Island.” It is on the license plates, it
the greeting that a tourist will receive in a hotel and the statement that one sees when
they arrive the island. But it is not such a happy island for those who live there, especially
if they want to be different. For Osaira, the identity of a true Aruban is someone like her
father; someone who worked to build the island and gave back to the island; someone
who knew every inch of the island and rode horses on the island, walked the beaches of
the island and spoke to the aloe vera plants on the island. As an artist, Osaira Muyale’s
love for her island is instinctive. She is that someone who walks the beaches, speaks to
the stars and listens to the wind. She doesn’t want to let go for she wants to give back.

She also wants to change the old mentality of the island and introduce contemporary
