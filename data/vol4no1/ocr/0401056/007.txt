In early 1997, Osaira Muyale was invited to participate in the Sixth Biennial of
Havana where the theme was “the Individual and Memory.” In Cuba, the ear became a
symbol of love, loss, memory and exile. She listened and heard the voices in Cuba in
silence. She fused her thoughts and their voices in one. She considered her public an
individual, and her work of art to be an homage to their memory. She created a cascade of

more than 1000 plaster cast ears — voices of silence: memories that are there, waiting to

be heard. Only if you LISTEN, she says. Each piece with a personality of its own, a story
to tell, waiting to be noticed, heard and seen. Osaira showed us that she has now become
a master in turning life experience in to sculptures. In this installation; we see genuine

sensitivity, an openness and vulnerability, simplicity yet strength; all that is feminine and

Osaira. She makes the statement: “Cuba, I am here, and I am listening... Your thoughts, your
laughter, your life and your suffering, joy and pain...-you are not isolated....We are here, We are listening,

and you are heard.” Osaira gave Cuba the message that they were being heard. But more
importantly, she gave the World the message that they should listen. This work
“Listening and Being Heard,” was featured on the front page of Arts and Leisure Section
of the New York Times in May by Mr. Edward Gomez in an article covering the Havana
Biennial of 1997. During the last week of the Biennial, Osaira was invited to participate in
the Soroa International Artists’ Workshop in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, which was organized
by the Wilfredo Lam Center in Havana. The rural setting of Soroa encouraged artists to
create site-specific work within the province of Pinar del Rio’s natural ecological
environment. The work was to be experimental and imaginative. The workshop was
unique in the sense that it brought international artists to inland Cuba to work closely
with Cuban artists in a rural and residential setting. It was supported by Hivos in the
Netherlands, the Triangle Arts Trust in London, the Gate Foundation in Amsterdam and
Wilfredo Lam Center in Havana. A child of north coast of Aruba, Osaira felt right at
home in Soroa. She wasn’t afraid of the wild natural environment around her, on the
contrary, she liked to walk in nature, gather materials, wood, leaves, rocks and get her
hands dirty, building and putting together “Matividiri No.9,” a name referring to her
childhood home. As she walked, she searched and remembered. Using the technique of

assemblage, she put together a wooden structure, which included objects that she

brought from Aruba. The result was an installation of impressive proportions; created
