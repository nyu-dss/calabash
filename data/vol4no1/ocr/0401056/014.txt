thought. She wants public to de-isolate itself and believes that the process begins within
the individual. In 2001, she participated in the exhibition “My Rights, Mind, Body and
Soul” with her work “I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,” a mixed media work of
photography, video & paper. It was part of the “Street Queen” series, where for a year
Osaira worked with Natalie, a drug addict, helping her by giving her a job and a place to
live at Eterno Studios. Natalie also became a model for Osaira where she posed during
her sleep, while shooting drugs, having seizures and in the “Illusion” wedding dress. The
photographs are a combination of roses, beautiful flowers and the scenes from the lives of
the local drug addicts. Osaira’s socially conscious realistic works exhibited in downtown
Oranjestad make the necessary statement that even in a “Happy Island” there are drug
addicts and those who suffer. The flowers represent the happiness on the island which is
an illusion. Osaira feels that as the artist it is her responsibility to see, feel and hear, but
to listen, reflect and make others see.

Since the summer of 2002, Osaira has been working on the project titled
“Immigration/Home.” This on-going project explores the issues of class stratification,
immigration, multi-culturalism, diversity and economic life on the island of Aruba. As
such, the work she produces reveals a radically different of idea of art to the natives of
her country. She completely rejects all relics of colonialism and conditioned conservatism.
She creates an additional studio in her home for other artists, local and foreign, to come
and collaborate with her. By the year 2002, the immigrant population in Aruba has gone
up by 35% and most of these immigrants come to the island from Colombia. They are
treated with not much respect and usually take “any” job. Aruba has two airports, one for
those that come from the United States and Europe, a beautiful modern, newly built, air-
conditioned terminal, and another one for those that come from the Caribbean countries
and Latin America. The Columbians arrive on the latter-one but they don’t care, for they
are there to make a living. Their numbers are not even exactly known for they do not
leave the country, and no one seems to care as long as they don’t cause a “visible”
problem. Osaira’s concept of “God-Dog” series was during this time, where she felt that
society was ruled and regulated by manipulation of words. The artist believed that by
ignoring an issue, the said issue would not disappear but turn into a problem instead.
She could feel the pain of the immigrants, the fact that they were treated poorly, when

she heard the wind in Aruba, she could also listen to their sadness, too. Her island was
