psyche of her audience. Her sculptures are potent and engaging. She travels to “no man’s
land,” asking questions, seeking answers and encouraging us to make our own journeys.
Her work challenges, enthralls, captivates and at times disturbs us. If art is personal for
her; she wants us to take it personally, too.

In the last 15 years, the “Ear” has become the trademark of Osaira Muyale’s work.
One can find the symbols of the Ear in her sculptures, paintings, mixed media and
installations. In the human body, the ear is the nerve center; the center for balance.
When our sight is lost, we can no longer see; therefore observe, but when our hearing is
lost, we can no longer communicate, hear and truly express ourselves. We simply are no
longer “there.” In Egyptian mythology, the eye is represented by Osiris as the seat of the
Eye. According to Dr. Dimitry Halley of Aruba’, the ear is the reverse image of the eye.
Where the eye observes and therefore represents an extravert, the ear takes in and
therefore is symbolizes an introvert. But since, Osaira’s work is about creating mutual
points of access; in a sense I believe she has managed to observe, take in, process and
bring out her life experience in the form of her artwork.

It is said that a ‘name’ carries one through their journey in life. Born and raised in
Aruba, Osaira’s seem [fit to her purpose. Her name is the combination of the name of
Egyptian Gods Osiris and Ra: Osai-Ra, providing her with the way to see the world, hear
her soul and create her work. Born in 1964 in Aruba, Osaira was the third child and the
only daughter; in a family of four children. She has two older brothers and a younger
brother who was born when she was 10 years old. Her mother, a lady, stunningly
beautiful, born and raised in Holland, was dedicated to her home and children. Her
father was a true Aruban, in soul and spirit. An architect by profession, he nonetheless
thought his children about the nature, mountains and the wild. Although they went to
school in Oranjestad, they were raised in Matividiri, the breathtakingly beautiful north
coast of Aruba. There, Osatra learned to ride the horses bareback, climb the rocks and
took in the scenery of cacti filled hills, the blue, red, purple and the orange of the twilight
sky and waited for her father to come up the hill every evening. Osaira also learned to live
up to be an ideal daughter and wife; where it is understood by the nature of tradition
that in the region that is the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Middle East; a daughter’s

role is still defined by her father and a wife’s duties are identified first by her husband,
