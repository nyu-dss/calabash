with approximately 35 pieces of wood between 5 — 7 feet each held together with cords
from Aruba. When asked, Osaira stated that in Soroa, she “buried her father,” and finally
was able to say goodbye to him. She lost her father years ago. Although she grew up ina
male dominant environment, she always had a sense of the fire in her and nurtured the
feminine spirit that existed within her by listening to her Soul. In Cuba, she remembered,
forgave and said goodbye to her father; whom after all she loved very much. To her,
building this structure was the ritual of valediction. Getting down on her knees and

produces its flower, so the psyche creates its symbols...” In our lifetime, archetypal images at one
point or another appear to the individual and almost everyone; these images are usually
quite bizarre; some mystical, usually too far-fetched. As the artist-individual, when
Osaira Muyale creates and performs her work, 'A Savage Dream,’ she takes herself and
her audience through the state of conflict into greater freedom. She lets the hair come out
her mouth; for all in the audience this symbolizes release of confusion, and oppression of
