conditioned qualities of sexuality, bearing children, vanity and pride. Osaira releases the
repressed anxiety of her memories. She washes herself with water; for water symbolizes
spiritual cleansing, expresses emotion, compassion and love. In ethno-mythologies,
water is where gentle creatures make their home and live in peace: dolphins, whales,
mermaids and water spirits. With the water, Osaira washes away the worries, sadness
and conflict. She reaches freedom.

In 1998, Osaira Muyale participated in “Lips, Sticks and Marks,” a landmark
exhibition of seven contemporary female artists of the Caribbean. The exhibition opened
in Barbados at the Art Foundry and travels to Trinidad hosted by Caribbean
Contemporary Arts at the Museum of Port of Spain. Her piece, “Chance and Change”
was a multi-media installation, where Osaira’s performance and use of her body was in a
sense a metaphor for the island of Aruba. Her mouth was silenced with an egg and there
were corks in her ears. It represented the current affairs in Aruba, an island that did not
listen to its soul, and could not speak its mind. The work also reflected her isolation from
the rest of the world as an artist. It was also an expression of her personal suffering, for

Osaira was going through divorce at the time. On the plastic see-thru cover that covered
her body, with a black marker, she wrote “A Letter to Myself... I know you for a long time, we
were playing hide and seek, I could and could not , Hear; see, touch, smell, talk to you...But still I knew you,
and still wanted to know more about you...appreciate, understand, trust and love you....we are playing
another game, the game of affirmation..A relationship of soul and brain, you are teaching me...the

existence of love, every time we meet...” With an egg in her mouth, corks in her ear, covered
with her writing on the see-thru garment, naked underneath, Osaira stepped under the
water and took off all that silenced her and let the power of water cleanse and purify her.
On a personal level, she could now hear and be heard; make the changes in her life. This
was a meditation and a deep cleansing. It was also a message sent to her Island in the
format of body politic; purify and remake thyself, heal thyself and listen to thy Soul.

Osaira Muyale’s profound love and devotion for Aruba provides her with the
courage to produce work that continues to be experimental and unique.

At this point, the Ear not only is a symbol of hearing one’s soul, but also becomes
a symbol that reflects our fears, miscommunication, imbalance, and isolation. The ear

represents pain; despair and madness. Despair comes on when one is isolated and cannot
