fall in love with the wind. It must be true; for Osaira came back to Aruba as an artist,
armed with her education from Rietveld. She also realized that artists in Aruba sutfered
from isolation, disilluston and lack of communication. Osaira believed that there needs to
be a space for all the artists, curators and art lovers on the island to convene, exhibit and
promote contemporary arts on the island. After experiencing the arts scene in
Amsterdam, London, and New York, Osaira Muyale wanted to create a contemporary
space in Aruba. She thought of an environment where artistic freedom and creation
could flourish like it had never been done before. She founded Eterno in the same manner
that she would create any other work; observing, seeing, living, feeling, hearing it in her
soul, and finally making it into a reality. From 1993 — 2002, Eterno Gallery and Studios
was a local and international venue that was highly beneficial for the cultural life of
Aruba. Although Aruba was mostly known as a touristic island, Eterno added to the rich
mosaic of the island and provided the much-needed artistic, aesthetic and cultural
vibrancy to the land. Along with Institute of Culture and Casa di Cultura, Eterno was
the only venue for contemporary art to be shown on the island of Aruba during those
years and Osaira Muyale spearheaded this effort along with Elvis Lopez. Today, Aruban
artists are represented in international exhibitions, art fairs and museums. But Eterno,
began with an idea that belonged to Osaira Muyale, for she wanted to change the old and
make it new and different. She wanted to apply her life experience and Eterno has also
become her work of art. For 9 years, she was also the director of Eterno Gallery where
Elvis Lopez, Remy Jungerman, Christopher Cozier, Alida Martinez, Yahaira Salas,
Glenda Heyliger, Renwick Heronimo, Ciro Abath, Madelene Kelly, Ryan Oduber, Kevin
Powers, Stan Kuiperi, Dimitri Halley, Ludwig de L’Isle, Osaira Muyale and many others
have exhibited, lectured, curated, participated in discussions, and listened.

In 1994, Osaira gave life to a metal chair and let it have wings and fly. Upon her
return from Rietveld, Osaira moved to Paradera, away from the scene in the city of
Oranjestad. There, she took an ordinary metal chair, and turned it into a sculpture by
fitting it into 4 shoes, for the Chair’s four legs. The industrial chair then received hand-
made pink wings and was painted red. An ordinary chair received life and became the
“Flying Red Chair.” [t was then proven that anything and everything had the capacity to
change and be changed around us. Osaira firmly believed in this, and she still does. She

felt attracted to found objects; specifically plaster and plastic fragments of the body: a
