In 1996, the visitors to the Institute of Culture in Oranjestad walked into an
installation that was part of the “Women in Evolution,” an exhibition that showed four
contemporary female Aruban artists. The room was covered with more than 1000 plaster
ears in flat spiral arrangement on the floor reflecting the ear’s inside narrowing circles.
The visitors had to tip-toe around the small plaster ears in order to go around the
installation; as they did, they noticed that each ear was scribbled with a black magic
marker; as they leaned down to see it closer, they discovered a poem written by Osaira in
Papiamento, the native language of the Dutch Antilles which is a combination of native
Indian, Portuguese, Dutch and Spanish. The poem, loosely translated in English, said:
“Look, if you don’t see, I can’t see, so we are blind, yet if you can, I too can see. Hear, if you

can’t hear, I cannot hear, so we are deaf, yet if you can, I too can hear.” The poem

continued, in spirals as she introduced “Feel,” “Give,” “Receive,” and along the journey there
were pit stops where the travelers were first allowed to go to bathroom if they wanted to,
in an old-fashioned baby potty, to let go of their fears, then they could rest on a rusty
metal bed, for this journey can take a lot of you; the pillow was made of plaster cast ears,
as they kept walking through the river of poetry and symbolism, they could stop at a
fridge, filled with more ears, urging them to communicate with their fellow passengers,

the spiral took them finally to a mirror for visual self-reflection, and then the poem and

the spiral, the Ear, ended, with a final word “Together.” For Louise Bourgeois “a spiralis also

a metaphor for consistency...and the soul is a continuous entity,” and Osaira has been
continuously encouraging her public to contemplate the reality in which they exist.
With this work, she tells us that an artist cannot live in isolation and that
communication is essential for the survival of all that is human. Osaira Muyale decides
that she must take an active role in waking others up from their long sleep.

Osaira Muyale received local and international critical recognition between 1992
- 1997. She was part of the Mira Arte of 1992 in Aruba and two of her sculptures from the
“Mysteries of the Soul” was exhibited at “Art in the Caribbean: Exclusion, Fragmentation

“

and Paradise, “ in Barcelona in an exposition organized by the MEIAC Museum of
Barcelona. Because of the unique quality of her work, the Artimo Foundation of
Netherlands, recognized Osaira as an artist who is “particularly well-equipped” to

breakthrough the literal and figurative barriers in visual art.
