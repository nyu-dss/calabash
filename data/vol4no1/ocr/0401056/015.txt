changing and no one wanted to acknowledge it. She believed that artists should work
with their community. Early 2003, she opened her home, Osaira Muyale Studio/Gallery,
for an exhibition, where she exhibited her Ear paintings, in the work “Untitled” (2) there
were 9 red ears coming from the red painted center, Osaira was asking her visitors to not
be deaf and hear the voice of their Soul, for she believed that that’s where the process
began. The fierce intensity of the color was to awaken the sleeping public; boldly. Yet, a
few steps ahead, there laid sketchbook on a pedestal; "Untitled II”. (3) It was painted
grey, with a sculpture of a grey plaster cast ear on the top cover. In the book pages of the
book, the visitor discovered the incredibly detailed and elegant drawings of the human
body, reminiscent of the fact that we were all made of muscles, bones and blood; the
same fiber. Osaira also installed a public neon sculpture to a beautiful house on the water

at L.G. Smith Blvd. #30 in Oranjestad, where in blue she wrote in italics “I_always
thought that everyone is the same” In the accompanying press release, she stated that “she

has always lived these words....they came from her mother’s heart and she believed in them. Until I have

experienced and discovered through life that this isnot the truth.”

In July and August of 2003, Osaira’s last work “Dog Race,” a film/mini DVD with
color, sound and 4 minutes in length, has been exhibited in Associacao Cultural -
Videobrasil, Sao Paulo, Brazil and Caribbean Contemporary Arts Center in Trinidad. The
work is based on society and barbarism and the fact that the society encourages
barbarism when the public allows set rules, bureaucratic systems and comfort to rule
and lets indifference take away human dignity. Based on this work, Osaira Muyale was
invited to participate and represent the Caribbean region in the international artist’s
workshop in October 2003 in the Yunan Province of China. The workshop has been
organized by the join collaboration of Triangle Trust and Gasworks Studios, London,
England, Caribbean Contemporary Arts Center in Trinidad and Upriver Loft in Kunming.
The artists will work around Mu Wang Fu Palace in a virtually mediaeval city. The
emphasis of the workshop will be the process; no doubt Osaira will hear the story of the
Chinese and in a mediaeval city on an ancient land and share her journey.

Osaira Muyale’s visual narratives are personal but they carry universal messages.
She communicates her views with simplicity and eloquence. She knows her craft well

and trusts in herself. She has developed a confident relationship within her own visual
