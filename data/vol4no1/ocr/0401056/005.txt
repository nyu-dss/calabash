finger, an arm, hair, and of course, the Ear. In Osaira’s visual universe, these objects serve
as her tools to discover the annals of her subconscious mind. Symbols and images that
reflect her thoughts and her emotional patterns. In her studio, Osaira like to put these
plaster body parts around, arrange them differently to “experiment” and to “see” how
they compliment each other, and what they would say to one another, if they could speak.

She creates the “Luggage:” a sculpture, made with a family heirloom, a 1920s antique
valise that belonged to her husband’s grandfather. From the upper corner of the luggage,
a small little hand of doll’s hand, a child’s hand almost reaching out; imprisoned child is
trying to come out. The child is in the luggage, in the closed and trying to come out, in a
closed society, in a conservative environment and cannot be free. At the other end of the
studio in Paradera, there is a sculpture “Untitled” — a mountain of shoes, but there is a
baby doll who is without a shoe. There is no one to hear her; one rich island, one crying
baby.

In 1995, Osaira Muyale had her first solo exhibition “The Mystery of Soul” at
Eterno Gallery. Public came face to face with her work which connected the
psychological complexity of the human mind to her favorite found-objects. She didn’t
stay there; she gave life to these objects. Using found objects was not new in art but the
making them speak, that was Osaira’s domain. She gave them a second life. Her “found
objects” all possessed individual histories but have lost their original functions, the artist
took them and gave them a second chance with a new life. She reincarnated them as
works of art. Wandering through the intimacy of the exhibition, she took her audience
through the age of childhood, the innocence of youth and passions of adulthood. One
cannot help but remember the “Untitled” sculpture of the Chair, whose hands reach out,
a praying chair; almost asking: could I be more than a chair, more than myself? These
images symbolize a journey of the soul. Through her work, Osaira makes us confront our
own personal history and past. “Mystery of the Soul” is about memory; and without
memory, a human being is not whole. In her exhibition, her sculptures are visceral, they
are strong and they have personality and life. They are given stories and now they have
new memories. Torsos hanging upside down, legs, feet, hands, and hair and the Ear. They
all tell a story; theirs, hers and perhaps ours? Although much of this may seem surreal, it
is very much real to Osaira and she invites us into her world; she believes that by looking

at her past, we are forced to look at ours as well.
