Because

Spirit or Ghost or whatever done catch he too
And Lucy, say, This Enough

So she ask for excuse

‘“Nough

And nobody hear

Cause all the big people dem in the church song
Grip

So Lucy, say, she fling off she polish shoe fa sheself
And she run

Out the door and pass steeple

And bush

Takin’ sea grape on the way

Don't care‘ bout no poison ivy or no thorn
Lucy gwan go

by the water where everything blue and still
And the sand hot on she bamsie

And the grains takin’ over she mahogany leg
And she aint care ‘ cause everything still
And when she done, Lucy say

Amen
