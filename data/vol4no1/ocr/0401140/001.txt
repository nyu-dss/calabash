CHURCH SONG

Pentecost and fifty day dun dun

When the woman forty pounds too big
jumpin’ and wavin’ she hand

Like she mad

And pastor say throw white cloth on she quick
So blood vessel nuh break

The organ music sing shrill

And the saxophone blare

In reverence

Sweet ignorance

Shuttin’ up and screamin’

And rockin’ and swayin

Bliss

Thick lip press, pink lipstick smudge

And cymbals a clashin’ like David Psalm command
‘Stead a lyre we gat voice

And booty and tambourine

And l’il Lucy in the snow white dress

Poor baby don’t know what to do

In the fourth pew from the back

So the pastor preach about seed and mustard
And spreadin’ it to the world

Somethin’ bout how the tree get big

And he shakin he top lip

And woman still on the floor

At Jesus altar, Trinity door

Still convulsin’ with she red pump already
Flyin’ off into the crowd

On Mr. Simmons’ left cheek

But he ain't give one damn
