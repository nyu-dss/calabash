nothing else. Father Riley is telling me to say this too. But what if Bessie figures it’s the
pigs that matter most of all..and who we are in this faraway place, far from England...
and Germany?

Stronger breezes come from across the ocean into the
cane fields, everywhere. Coming across the wide Caribbean, the entire archipelago,
blowing far and wide, from Florida and North Carolina too, places I've come to know

about. I imagine cooler winds also blowing!

Bessie is more nervous, I sense. Her father is nervous too.
I look closely at Bessie, her expression, and

maybe it’s because she doesn’t want the pigs to die when they start
running for their lives.

Now I’m disappointed in her, because I think if she doesn’t run iv’'ll be like the
end of Empire, suddenly. And do I really want it to end?

Father Riley wags a finger at me...at Bessie. At us all

Mister Joe smiles from a distance, and drifts farther away.

Bessie starts talking to herself; and maybe she still
imagines talking to them each one coming around her again. And the boys will tease
her once more, especially when she makes a face.

“Hey, Pig-Face, won’t you run again, thin as you are?”

“Yeah, really thin!”

Bessie looks at them, and I know at once: she hears the applause
from a great big distance, coming as if from across the ocean, same as I once told her to
listen for. Go on, imagine it, Bessie, I urge.

It’s now like all the world’s coming closer to us.

But it’s only the pigs coming around her, squealing, as muchas I hear too. Yeah,
Mister Joe makes a strange face; and then I see Father Riley in a distant place—really far
away--still swallowing communion wine, the last drop left. Yeah, I want to tell him:
Bessie will indeed run the fastest race ever, thin as she is an’ all. And the pigs will be on

with her, running along with her, even if Her Majesty is watching.
