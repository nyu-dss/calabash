into the sea and ocean to escape Mister Joe’s “murdering” hands. Christ! Father Riley,
what will he say now?

“Haram, haram,” voices rise tn the air.

A gust of trade wind comes, the ocean’s waves lashing. Palm trees hurl their
branches. Mangrove and courida flagellate, leaves falling. Shrill voices are everywhere,
faces of glee in the bright sun.

I start running again alongside Bessie, being her coach, panting and heaving; ah,

Father Riley wants me to do just that. And Bessie must run to save the Empire. She must?

I'm out of breath, as Besste runs ahead of me. Far ahead.

I shout to her, yet encouraging her on. The wind slaps harder, my ears sting, It’s a
hurricane coming, remember? Sugar cane wave their tassel-like fronds, flaunting arrows
in the wind. “Can I run faster?”

Bessie calls out back to me.

“Faster!” I pant. Then, “How much faster?” Father Riley is making faces. And
maybe before long he too will yearn to return to England, no?

Mister Joe somewhere is also urging Bessie on, with his mind still on the pigs.
Maybe he doesn’t want Bessie to run for Empire...as Bessie now has the sun in her eyes
and perhaps thinking of the big day that’s not far ahead when she will show the world
who she really is, runt an’ all!

Bessie stops, and I quickly say to her, “You mustn’t slow down now.”

“T will if | want to,” she pouts, making a face.

Then it’s her father, something between them.

“You must train harder, Bessie,” I say.

“What if I don’t want to?” she scowls. Christ, where’s Father Riley now? But it’s
the boys she’s also thinking about., all her own age. And doesn’t Mister Joe not want

her torun anymore? Father Riley waves, head lifted up, so haughty-looking. England is

all, see!
“Why must I run so fast?” Bessie snaps, and the heat’s getting to her. Getting to
me too. It’s getting to Father Riley most of all, red blotches forming on his face. Will he

really return to England where it’s damp or just cold-cold?
