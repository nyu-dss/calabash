squeal. Not run for their lives? See, 1am now the Todd House trainer. And Father Todd, an
English priest, he was, yeah!

The boys laugh again, pointing. To me? And Mister Joe keeps going about his
business, as the pigs run helter-skelter; and indeed Bessie’s father is going after them...to
“murder” the pigs. What else?

“Why he’s not a Muslim like we?” cries one, cringing.

“Pork is haram,” wails another.

Mister Joe turns around and wags a finger at them.

“Haram, haram,” the boys sing. And voices wane after a while.

Back in class Bessie is thinking about the boys, I know, still making faces at them,
or maybe she will just imitate the pigs like a new habit. “Pig-face,” I imagine the boys
hurling at her. Then, “Black like a pig, heh-heh!”

Everyone laughs; and I, really a young school teacher--with them~I also laugh.
Father Riley will come by to remind us about the name “Todd” being that of another
English priest, a kindly man, indeed (as I heard): the same who left us a long time ago
alter the tropical heat got too much for him; some still say Father Todd became mad
pining away for England. This only!

Now Father Riley wants us to become athletes, as a way to save the British

Empire. Really? At once I figure Bessie will run as fast as she can. And it’s like my own

dream also. “ Really run for Empire?” the boys let out next. Heh-heh-heh!

“Yeah, run to save Father Riley too, no?” another scoffs. How they hector or just
hurl abuse. And what can I do about it, eh?

I imagine Bessie doing the hundred-yard dash, skinny legs an’ all. Her heart
thumping, mouth set hard: gosh, she’s really running her heart out! Imagine her running
faster than Wilma Rudolph. Who? Ah, Bessie’s in the Olympics. “Run, Bessie, run!” I let
out voicelessly. Father Riley is looking at me, then at Bessie..at the same time. The
others pick up on it, “Run, Bessie, run!” They are no longer scoffing. Echoes are
everywhere. “Run for dear life’s sake,” another hollers, a Hindu boy named Rajan.

Bessie is indeed doing the hundred-yard dash before a large crowd in a stadium,

as the boys cheer her on. Then they berate her father again, the pigs yet close by...running
