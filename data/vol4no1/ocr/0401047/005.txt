will throw his head back and drink communion wine, swallowing it down, in one great
gulp as he stands before the altar. God comes near then, I figure. Christ coming down
from the Cross too, no? — Bessie and the others-the boys mostly--will look long at
Father Riley and maybe wonder about faroff places, as I do.

Will Father Riley say a few words from the pulpit about the big day
coming...and about saving the Empire?

The boys now fancy themselves running, also--they can’t fool me, because the big
day is at hand. Maybe they hope to go to England one day and really see Trafalgar
Square, as they’ve talked about. Yeah, see the pigeons most of all, and who can really
kick a pigeon in Trafalgar Square? Can anyone..anywhere? Yeah, Father Riley’s still
talking to them, taking them there; and what if they want to run so that Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth will look at them? Not look Bessie, if she’s thinking about the pigs only?

“Bessie can run anywhere she wants,” I'm about to say.

Yeah, imagine her running in Asia, Africa...South and North
America, but mostly in Jamaica, Trinidad, Cuba, closer to where we live. Really? Eyes
widen; and censors with smoke swirling in the air it is, as Father Riley waves to me. Ash
Wednesday, remember? The smell of candles, then mahogany smells waft in the air. I
inhale hard. Holiness is upon us, and we pray altogether, to God the Father, God the
Son, God the Holy Ghost in this the highest church building in the world. It really is!

Father Riley is yet fully at it. Rule Britannia! Land of Hope and Glory! Clamorous
voices are everywhere. Indeed, Bessie imagines herself in a huge stadium, a place bigger
than Trafalgar Square, as thousands cheer, foreigners—white people all-all who take part
in the Queen’s coronation. Then we'd sung “God Save the Queen.” Everything
sacramental yet, the blood of Christ flowing. See, Father Riley has England deep in his
veins, he can’t fool me.

More aroma: dark wine, I inhale sitting in a pew in front.

I cross myself, thinking Bessie will run really well. Then Todd House will
become famous the world over, I will be famous too, for [ve become a genuine track
coach, says Father Riley. I cross myself. Bessie also crosses herself. “See how fast I can

run,” she hums, her face a tremor.

Tam nervous too. Oh God, help her run really fast!
