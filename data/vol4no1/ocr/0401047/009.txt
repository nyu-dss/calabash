Yeah, even as the boys are in England, the Muslim and Hindu ones also, and
those “converted” also. It’s what I will imagine while training the other kids in Todd
House-- to want to run as fast they can. Fast as Bessie, see.

Bessie’s father will come by once in a while to watch me, and maybe imagine
Bessie running...in England... where the trade winds no longer hurl...where the sea and
ocean grows wider the more you look at it. Where’s the hurricane now? And Her
Majesty is pointing from somewhere, speaking in her clipped English accent...though ’m
not sure about what really. But Father Riley knows, being back in England among his
own kind sipping tea and talking about us... for the rest of his days, I figure. Even as |
once ina while savour the wine he drank at Communion from the altar in the tallest
wooden church in our
part of the world; and it will always be about Empire, as he rubs his skin with red

blotches on it. This only, I will think about, see.
