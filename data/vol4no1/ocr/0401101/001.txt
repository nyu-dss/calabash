MISSIVE FROM A CALIFORNIA HAITIAN LIVING
WITH A FRENCHMAN

I married my colonizer. Guess that makes me a traitor of sorts. I broach the
subject with my friend, Jeannie, who is Jewish and married a German. It is time to heal, I
think, she says.

The French caused so much trouble in Haiti, first by raping their slave women,
then treating the resulting children honorably—passing on the family name, the right to
inherit, and sending them off to France for expensive educations. Today, those half-blood
children still think they’re better than their darker brothers and sisters. 200 years later,
they still don’t mix, dance, kiss or make love together. But who am I to speak? I’m one of
those half-blood descendants, and I married a white man, ancestor of the rapist.

It’s time to heal, I tell myself, when I notice the worst characteristics of the
French embraced by mulatto culture. We have taken on their arrogance, even though we
own the dubious and oft-heard distinction of poorest in the western hemisphere. We have
their haughtiness, which celebrates education above all, even as we engage in benign
neglect of our literacy rate. We take pride in our sophistication, while steps away from
our mansions, neighbors live in shacks without running water and electricity. Even
though I prefer the lilting, lyrical charm of our island accent, and find it disingenuous
when Haitians try to “sound” French, after 15 years of living with a Frenchman and
attendant new relations, I sometimes find myself using French expressions I wouldn’t

begin to know how to say the Haitian way.
