“Haitians speak excellent French,” I hear my husband say to French people, who
ask about the difference. I ask him what he means by that; he says Haitian French is
closest to the form and structure of the way the language is spoken in France. I get the
feeling that’s supposed to be a compliment.

It’s time to laugh, I tell myself.

We kicked the French out of Haiti and look what it got us. When I visit other
islands in the Caribbean, I want to cry because, for all their problems, many have
escalators in airports, elevators in tall buildings, paved roads with working traffic signals
and phone systems, that while not perfect, do not make cell phones the equivalent of the
second coming, as in Haiti. But look at what we reaped from independence. We retained
our intrinsic exotic African flavor more than any other island; our Haiti chérie is
enveloped in a shroud of mystery, magic and charisma like no other place on earth; we
are the biggest producers of Black intuitive art in the world; our people embrace the
spirit of God in so many faceted ways, like Ezili, Bawon Samdi, Kouzin Zaka, Gran Bwa,
La Siren, and the list goes on... If God equals love, and God equals power, then love and
power permeate Haiti in multiples. Some claim they can almost touch that potent mix,
even as they step off the plane—it’s that thick.

Some say Haiti is cursed. We can talk about Haiti's political tribulations and

hell-spun problems until the skinny Haitian cows come home, but we retain our African

beauty, the lyricism of our market women and secret magnetism that makes feeling people
fall in love with the island again and again. Martinique and Guadeloupe may have other
attributes, but Haiti has the spirit.

Did we pay too high a price for independence? You decide, I can’t.

We kicked your ass before and I can do it again, I remind my husband when his
French arrogance surpasses even my father’s own inherited haughtiness. And we laugh

because he knows it’s true.
