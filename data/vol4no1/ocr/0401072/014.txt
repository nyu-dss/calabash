back in their mythological cosmic figures, one could hardly see where adaptation to

Western urban culture started and what remained of the old culture that is transmitted

from generation to generation. And so the “Pikin fu busi” (Children of the forest) series

about Indigenous children came to be.
“Pikin fu busi” was followed by “Pikin fu foto” (Children of the city). She observed

different problems among urban children than those among the children of the interior.
The influence of Western lifestyle was very great. Children watch TV the whole day, and
see all kinds of B-films with lots of violence. There are bullies and peer-groups. In this
series she uses mixed media with a lot of ripping and gluing, reconstituting torn

elements to a whole. “True to life”, Kit-Ling says.

The search for identity is not typically Surinamese. In 2000 FVAS and Eject

initiated by Ellen Ligteringen, a Dutch artist whose mother is Surinamese. The exchange

Ellen en Kit-Ling]

A cycle of lectures was part of the exchange program. Charlotte Elias, Director of
CCA (Caribbean Contemporary Arts) and Kenwyn Crichlow of the University of the
West Indies, Trinidad, were two important speakers. At the end of her presentation,
Charlotte Elias asked the people in the auditorium:

“Do you as people feel that you belong to which region? Latin America, the Caribbean or

Kit-Ling’s answer to this question would be: “Surely not Latin American because
we don’t speak Spanish, even though we are part of South America, geographically. We
are a former Dutch colony, and that is clearly visible. We have a typically Caribbean
history. Migration is important, as it is in all Caribbean countries. People come and go.
Even our “original inhabitants”, the Indigenous Peoples, were nomads. Our ancestors
came from everywhere. We have a huge diversity of cultures and ethnicity.”

The choice for cultural and/or multicultural themes has also influenced Kit-Ling’s

opinion about the way works of art are judged: “My whole life 've heard that as a person
