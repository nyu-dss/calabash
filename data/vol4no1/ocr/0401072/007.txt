were all picked by hand. Her youngest sister liked to play under these trees and get up to

mischief, like playing with fire.

Women

The twentieth Surinamese Independence Day in 1995 was the reason for a large
exhibition of Surinamese art in Surinamese Museum in the recently restored Fort
Zeelandia in Paramaribo, as well as in the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. A full-color
catalogue accompanied the exhibition. This exhibition contained no work by woman
artists.

Were Surinamese women artists not considered good enough, or had they simply
not been considered?

When Kit Ling asked about it, the organizers explained that they had only hada
few months to prepare the exhibition.

Kit-Ling then realized that she had been sleeping in the earth, covered by dirt,
just like the woman sleeping in her fetal position that she had painted the year before.
Ideas about her own position as a woman, the position of women in general and the
position of Surinamese women in particular, became new themes in her work.

“Piranhas and Women”, a series she had been working on at the time, took on a
new meaning. The first reason for these paintings were the enormous logging
concessions that had been issued to transnational logging companies. She compared the
uncontrolled felling of trees to the construction of a hydroelectric dam in the 1960s,
which caused a large area of jungle to be flooded. The inhabitants of that area were
forced to leave their beautiful villages along the river. They were evacuated to new
villages that resembled refugee camps. The original idea was that the hydroelectric lake
could also function as a holiday destination for swimming, canoeing and waterskiing.
Miami Beach along the lake never materialized, and the waters are infested with
piranhas.

The women in the paintings originally represented Suriname. In the process of
painting, the symbolic meaning was gradually lost, and to Kit-Ling they became actual
women, remaining undisturbed, even though they are surrounded by piranhas.
