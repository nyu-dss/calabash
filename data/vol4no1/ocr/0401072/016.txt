Suriname and lived there is whole life. He was internationally reknowned for his
beautiful botanical illustrations and dioramas.

Kit-Ling struggles against the idea of elitist art. Her statement: Art is more than a
painting on the wall ora sculpture in a hall. Art should be more part of our daily life. "Art
is life’ and 'Life is Art’. This position is the basis for her work, whether it is a painting, an
illustration for a calendar or a postage stamp.

Since the end of 2002, cultural and ethnic diversity has become the driving theme
for Kit-Ling. It is a broad theme. How can one possibly explore such an extensive subject
in depth? The answer came the moment she actually started thinking about it. Her old
interest, dance, would enable her to penetrate the essence of the various cultures. Kit-
Ling has taken up ballet again since the first half of 2003, and has now also started
kathak classes at the Cultural Center of the Indian embassy. She has no idea what the
final result might be, but she is convinced that this is the right way to try to make her
vision of multiculturalism profound, a vision that will guide the production of inter-

cultural art.
