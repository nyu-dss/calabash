The new rulers, who claimed to be revolutionary reformers, lost any initial
goodwill they had internationally as well as nationally when they murdered seventeen

prominent citizens at the end of 1982. The people were shocked but effectively silenced

for a while....

International aid to Suriname dried up, inflation reached record heights and many
products grew scarce. Kit Ling set up a small toy business for which she designed the
toys of wood and cloth. She helped her husband in the enterprise he started from his
parents’ house. Her son was born in 1984. Then in 1987, her husband, who was a general
medical practitioner, wanted to go the Netherlands to specialise in occupational
medicine. His family went along. Kit-Ling chose to stop teaching and to take up art
professionally, having discovered that it was not possible to effectively combine the roles
of teacher, wife, mother, homemaker as well as being an artist. In the Netherlands she
became a free-lance illustrator for a publisher of educational books. She returned to
Suriname with her son at the end of 1988, while her husband kept travelling up and
down between Suriname and the Netherlands to finish his specialisation. From 1988 on,
her main preoccupations were her family, including her mother, and the arts.

The Federatie van Beeldende Kunstenaars — Federation of Graphic Artists — was
founded in Suriname in 1998, for which Kit Ling still is the secretary. In that role she
helped organise various successful international exchange programmes.

In the meantime, her husbandcl’s restaurant business flourished and in 1997 a hotel
was added. Kit-Ling adapted the lobby for exhibitions, to enable artists who work and
live in Suriname to present their work. She publishes positive and informative articles in
newspapers to increase the appreciation of Surinamese artists and their work.

The future looks bright for Kit-Ling. She has been invited to teach at the MO-B /
Masters Course in Art & Culture. She has agreed, because it will be on a challenging

subject that she can work out herself: the psychology of art. She mounted a large solo
exhibition in 2004.
