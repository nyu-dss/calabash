she presented images of dancing women in traditional costumes, vibrant landscapes,
startled birds, Javanese ceremonies and other typical Surinamese views. The paintings
were executed in oils, water-based paints and pencil, for Kit-Ling is not bound to any
particular technique. She loves to experiment with materials as well as styles.

President Venetiaan, who opened the exhibition, recognized the graceful, fluid
ballet of her high school period in her water colors and oil paintings. Her later work,
studies of patterns from Maroon culture, shows that she is also able to paint in a more
direct, rigid style.

Kit-Ling’s work expresses her experiences, her thoughts, her view of life. She has
a message, and this is most apparent when she combines poetry with painting. But when
she uses visual images exclusively, there is often some surprising element that challenges

the viewer to think.

Nature
“The Back Yard” (1992) is an intriguing painting of wild growth behind thick iron
bars, very different from traditional landscape paintings. The jungle war and crime
changed the nature of wild places in Suriname, making it inaccessible. The following
poem she incorporated in a brightly coloured painting emanates the same kind of

melancholy.

a busi ben kenki

a ben kenki

so wan langa ten k’ba
wan dei mi sa las’ pasi

inia memre fu busi

the rain forest has changed

it already changed

a long time ago

one day I'll be lost

in the memory of the rain forest
