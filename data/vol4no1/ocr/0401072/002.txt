leaves...)” became well known. One of the main exponents of this movement was the
AMS principal, Ronald Venetiaan, who would later become president of the independent
Republic of Suriname twice. The atmosphere of nationalism was also tangible at the
AMS, in the idea of “studying in one’s own country,” And so, after graduation, Kit-Ling
decided to stay in Suriname, in contrast to her siblings. But choices were limited; you
could study to become a teacher, doctor or lawyer, but none of these careers appealed to
her. Architect seemed like an interesting job, but then she would have had to study in
Delft, in the Netherlands. Her eldest brother advised against that, because she was a
woman and mostly men studied in Delft.

She has liked drawing ever since she could remember. In primary school, drawing
lessons were the only ones she took seriously and followed with concentration. In
advanced elementary and secondary school, the margins of her notebooks were always
full of drawings. She kept drawing after school and she still remembers her youngest
brother teaching her the rules of perspective. She therefore decided to make her hobby
into a career and become an art teacher, just like Rudi Getrouw and Stuart Robles de
Medina, who both trained to become art teachers but established themselves as artists in
Paramaribo. She studied Art at the Instituut voor de Opleiding van Leraren (the advanced
teacher training college), where students were taught as though in art school. The fact
that you were expected to teach later was secondary. Among her teachers were Rudi
Getrouw, Stuart Robles de Medina and Jules Chin A. Foeng, important names in the
Surinamese art scene. She was the first graduate of the MO-A course but because of the
lack of advanced training, she eventually decided to study for the MO-B level in the
Netherlands after all.

In 1979 she returned to Suriname, which by now had been independent for four

years. She started working in government service as an art teacher in a secondary school

and her former training institute, the IOL. Kit Ling transfered to the Project Curriculum

Vernieuwing Basisonderwijs, the department of the Ministry of Education charged with
reform of the elementary school curriculum. There her team developed a new method for
teaching drawing in elementary schools, which was also piloted in a number of schools
under her direction. Then in 1980 a military coup put an end to parliamentary democracy

in Suriname.
