c. Awareness of another culture or different cultural aspects and wanting to

be part of that because it is all part of one’s country.

Kit-Ling places herself in group 4, particularly in 4c. She simply starts working
with anything that she has observed in the area of cultural expression. But it is just like
falling in love; once the first fascination with the look of things has passed, one starts
looking for the deeper meaning, and then one finds true love or not.

In 1986 a war broke out in the interior of Suriname. Traditional authority among
the relatively isolated tribes was disrupted by armed groups. One Maroon village was
completely exterminated. Schools were shut down. Many disrupted families moved to
Paramaribo, were ghettos arose.

Prior to the jungle war, Kit-Ling visited the interior regularly for her work or to
enjoy nature. In 1984 children in the interior had regular drawing classes in school.
Cultural education outside of school was a family matter. Traditional Maroon of
Indigenous art was taught by fathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, grandmothers,
mothers, aunts, sisters. To what extent was this still possible after the war? In the series,
‘Pikin fu busi, pe yu de?’ (Children of the forest, where are you?) Kit-Ling wonders what

indicating how Javanese culture in the form of eating bami has filtered through to Maroon
children. Their isolation has been broken, they have become part of multicultural society.

After the war Kit-Ling decided to resume her trips to the interior. One of these
was to the Indigenous village of Palumeu. The advert said: ‘Get to know the oldest
inhabitants of Suriname and their culture’. Once there, visitors were only allowed into a
sectioned-off part of the village; the villagers were not keen on snooping tourists. They
also refused to perform the dance that had been promised. However, they liked to play
volleyball with the tourists. The trip was not a waste of money, because the rapids and
the virgin Amazonian jungle were impressive. The Indigenous People were friendly. The
children were particularly charming. For Kit-Ling, seeing the children in NBA t-shirts
was a big eye-opener. But the best was the small details that revealed their traditional
culture. A typical example was the hairstyles of a number of boys; they were modern

hairstyles, but the patterns in the hairstyles were original. Just like there is no front or
