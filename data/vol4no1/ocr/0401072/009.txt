Many paintings of women stem from this period, showing the figures’ character and

emotional state:

- Free Spirit, woman with a free mind, happy in all situations

- Survivor, woman with the urge to survive

- Mai, a Hindustani woman burdened by the past

- Childless mothers, facial expressions of women who are mothers but who have no
children (anymore). They might have lost their children through war.

- Angel on Earth, the innocent face of a young woman, ignorant of earthly suffering.

- Mother and Daughter, the modest mother who functions within a strict religious
system and the daughter who is open to the challenging world.

In 1992 Kit-Ling said in an interview with Elvira Rijsdijk, art critic of the daily
newspaper De Ware Tijd: “If you really and truly want something as a woman, you must go
