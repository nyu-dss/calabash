Asked about this, she said: “Before you can see a woman’s work, you need to peer
through the washing on the line.”

She considers taking the aspect of womanhood to its extreme in her work, but
loses interest when she realizes that this has already been done in Europe by a number of
women artists. She decides to elaborate on a theme that has preoccupied her for years:

multiethnic Suriname.

Out of Many Cultures, One People
Kit-Ling considers herself an artist from a multicultural society. Already in high

school she was fascinated by the rich diversity of culture among the ethnic groups in

Suriname. The poem ‘Wan Bon’ by Dobru made a deep impression on her.

Wan bon One tree
Someni wiwiri So many leaves
Wan bon One tree
Wan liha One river
oo So many creeks
Someni kriki All are going t
going to one sea
Alae gona wan se
One head
Wan ede So many thoughts
Someni prakseri Thoughts among which one good one
Prakseripe wan bun mus de Must be
Wan gado One god
Someni fasi fu anbegi So many ways of worshipping
Ma wan papa But one father
Wan sranan One Suriname
ee So many hair types
Someni wiwirl So many skin colors
Someni skin So many tongues
Soment tongo One people
Wan pipel
