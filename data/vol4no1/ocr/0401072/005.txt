This is from a series of paintings that express her view of the relationship
between man and nature in words and images. The poems arose spontaneously,
complementing the images, and showing the intimate link between nature and humanity.

In one of her paintings she writes:

firia kraktifuson
yu yeye sa de
inden deidi

alene fadon

feel the power of the sun
your soul will be there
in those moments

when rain falls

In other paintings she shows how man is part of nature, physically as well as
spiritually, such as ‘Wan Dren’(1994). The image of a women sleeping in a fetal position
reflects Kit-Ling’s concern about pollution in Paramaribo. It is as though the woman lies

buried in the earth, while on the ground there is garbage. She added this to the painting:

me ben dren wan dren

adrenno bende wandren

I had a dream

and it was no dream
(translation: Monique Pool)
Kit-Lings link with nature reflects her spiritual side. She wanted to take up

hatha-yoga after ballet, but only at the end of 1997 was she able to find time for herself,

without responsibilities to others.
