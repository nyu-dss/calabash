After five years of yoga she says this: “Once, during a trip to the interior, I was
sitting in a waterfall. ‘Are you meditating?’ a companion asked. ‘No’, I said. ‘I’m just
observing nature’. When I had started yoga, I realized that I really had been meditating
then. I only never knew it was called meditating.”

The paintings inspired by the poem ‘dare to dream’, are intentionally spiritual.
Especially the painting “...to be...” reflects what she has learned from yoga: “Without
breath one cannot live. By breathing one absorbs oxygen. Oxygen is produced by plants.
Through them you live. You live, so you think. Meditation produces enlightened thought.

”

This one can project into the cosmos.” The painting originated spontaneously from the
subconscious, triggered by a poem. “The poem inspired many paintings. They all seem
rather surreal.’

The same is true for her first experiments on wood. By meditating on the patterns
of the wood, Kit-Ling allowed her subconscious to come to the fore. In her later work,
the pattern of the wood governed the image less. She even sticks pieces of paper on the
wood and keeps to a particular theme from folklore.

Nature also plays an important role in Kit-Ling’s personal life. When her father
dies in 1997, her love of nature helps her cope. She makes a series of watery landscapes.
Her father loved the black waters of Surinamese creeks and swamps. He often went

fishing, and took the whole family to Republiek, a holiday resort along the Coropina

Creek, every year. An old Creole resident of the plantation taught Kit-Ling to paddle a

korjaal, a traditional dug-out canoe. When she was young she spent hours in the waters
of the Coropina Creek. After her father’s death she automatically starts painting this
creek. She becomes obsessed by the reflection of leaves in the water. The transition from
object to reflection seemed as fluid as the transition from life to death. And in the same
way the reflection of trees and plants in the water seemed clearer than the real thing, so
death seemed more tangible at that time than life itself.

Her mourning ends with bright and lively paintings as a reaction to the dreamy
landscapes, but nature and memories of youth keep playing a role, as in “Uncle Eddy
Wessels’ ceiba tree”. Uncle Eddy Wessels used to live a short distance away, and had a
large ceiba tree in his yard and he played classical music. The two mango trees in “The

mango trees, my little sister is making a fire” were her father’s favorite trees. The fruit
