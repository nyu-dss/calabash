you need to be honest. In the Catholic schools I was on, you had to be honest and never
lie. All my drawing teachers told me to be honest in my work. So I have always been
honest and I hope to stay honest in the future. But during my whole career I have felt
indirect but constant pressure not to be myself. I had to produce art of the great Western
art world. I refuse to conform to that and not be myself.”

According to Kit-ling it is the owners of art galleries, art critics, art collectors,
senior civil servants in ministries and directorates of Art and Culture, museum managers,
managers of funds, who dominate thinking about art within the current art world. The
highest people in this circuit, the managers of major international museums and donor
organizations, assisted by curators, are actually the major artists, because they have the
power to elevate work to the position of Art with a capital A. Generally, participants in
the process of art listen to their opinion.

The Western art world generally treats all creative expression with any cultural-

exhibition with the same name “Afro-American Arts of the Rainforest”, which had
toured various museums in the USA, to the Netherlands: “..although major Dutch
museums repeatedly rejected the idea of presenting arts from their former colony as “art”

Art with a capital A cannot be functional. As soon as a work of art acquires
anything else than a purely esthetic function, it is no longer Art and is looked down upon
in the great art circles.

Sometimes Maria Sibylla Meriam (1647-1717), PJ. Benoit (1782-1854) and Gerrit
Schouten (1779-1839) are considered artists, but sometimes they are rather scorntully
called illustrators. Maria Sibylla Meriam (1647-1717) from Germany and P.J. Benoit
(1782-1854) from Belgium lived and worked in Suriname for a short while, and published
beautifully illustrated books. Their work mainly showed images from the natural world

and daily life in Suriname. Gerrit Schouten (1779-1839) was a mullatto who was born in
