- Justa little resistance, going up the stream
- Diving without water, it did not matter at all
- Hanging down the hill, an easy way of living

In these paintings Kit-Ling expresses the way she operates as a woman in
Surinamese society, as she experienced it up to then. She lived life lithe and gracefully,
jumping, ducking, balancing, hanging, enjoying nature in Suriname, and nothing was
impossible.

Kit-Ling explains her approach to life in different ways. At the AMS she shared her
class mainly with boys because of the subjects she had chosen: mathematics, chemistry
and physics. When she studied art, the other students were also mostly men.
Functioning in a male-dominated world thus became natural. In her time she was one of
the few who chose to study in Suriname alter finishing the AMS. The course was not
doing well, and every year a substantial number of students dropped out. She was the
first to graduate from the MO-A course, even before people who had been at it for years.
This strengthened her ability to persevere. She learned to find a solution to any problem.
As she said to a friend from Holland in the early 1990s, when there were widespread
shortages: “If there is no créme fraiche, we use regular milk and some flour. If we can’t
buy butter, we make it ourselves. And if we can’t make butter, we have custard instead of
cake.”

The new theme, ‘women’, combines well with her earlier theme, ‘nature’. The link
with nature remains visible and you can feel how the female figures are empowered by
nature.

“Once upon a time, she was passing by...” and “Once upon a time, she was drifting
by...” call to mind a fairytale atmosphere. The mermaid passes all the monsters, as though
they were flowers. The mermaid stands for all Surinamese women.

Kit-Ling is of the opinion that Surinamese women, including herself, are able to
survive all kinds of dangerous situations while remaining cheerful and optimistic, as if
nothing has happened. She thinks that Surinamese women are strong women; she is
proud of her sisters.

In 1998 she started experimenting with painting on massive wooden planks. Initially

she tried to find images in the patterns of the wood, the way people do with clouds.
