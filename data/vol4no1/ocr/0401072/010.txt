but if it is unfair, just ignore it. You can work with fair criticism.” Nine years later, in
2001, she writes the following commentary on her work which was included in the
traveling exhibition “Between Lines”:

“Often people consider very ‘masculine’ features when judging whether an
artwork is good or not. Words like ‘strong’, ‘powerful’ and ‘revolutionary’ are used to
emphasize it is good. Being a woman, I want to create a work of art, very feminine, soft,
lovely and peaceful. I do so, even when I am visualizing something that is very strong and
shocking. For instance: In these works, I used traditional Maroon patterns of patchwork,
and images of Maroon girls of a society destroyed by a civil war and Western culture.”

Using the geometric patterns of Maroon patchwork was part of a study of shapes
and colors. The results of his research were not unique. Her paintings prompted a
number of people to remark: “Oh, this is Mondriaan”. It annoyed her, but then she read
the introduction to the book “Afro-American Arts of the Rainforest” van Sally and

Richard Price, and realized that this reaction should not have surprised her. The Prices
write: “In spite of growing sophistication about arts, for example, of Africa or Oceania, many people
have expressed surprise that Maroon woodcarving is not dominated by masks or fetish figures and that
Maroon patchwork textiles (because of their geometric patterns and contrastive primary colors) remind

them more of Mondriaan than of Abidjan.”

“The results of my color research were also outdated,” she admits. She found that
there were female and male colors. Pastels were mainly feminine and bright primary
colors were more masculine. “The Chinese have known about feminine and masculine
colors for centuries. I recently read that in a book about Feng Shui.” The reactions to the
results of her research do seem to indicate a greater appreciation for masculine colors.

She is not too enthusiastic about the results of the research mentioned above,
because she spent almost a year reinventing the wheel. Still, her work from this period
was Clearly appreciated by a part of the public of the 2000 National Art Fair.

The National Art Fair is an annual event that has grown to be a national art exhibition.
School children visit the exhibition to write reports on artists and their work. In 2000
Kit-Ling made a little installation in her booth by stringing up a washing line with a

Chinese cheongsam, a Javanese sarong, a Hindustani shawl and some baby clothes.
