Before and after independence, up to the early 1980s, Dobru helped create a
political climate in which the government stimulated Surinamese to get to know and
appreciate each other’s culture. Kit-Ling fully supported this idea.

Visiting the cultural shows that were organized by official institutions were not
enough for her. She went to the field herself, to the kampong, where she experienced
Surinamese Javanese popular theatre, and to Abrabroki, a poor area in the capital with a
fairly large Maroon community at the time. She was introduced to their way of
celebrating and their way of dancing. In the District of Wanica, with its Hindustani
majority, she say a chokra-danser for the first time during a simple Hindu wedding.
Fascinated by this female impersonator, she made a dry needle sketch on a flattened
butter tine. Her teacher Rudi Getrouw didn’t much like this etch. He did not understand
the subject of the male dancer dressed like a woman, and he didn’t particularly care for
the experimental use of a butter tin. Etching was done on copper or at least zinc.
Disappointed, Kit-Ling avoided themes from folklore for a number of years.

Only around 1990, when she was asked to make prints for a calender to be issued
by the Rando Suriname furniture factory, did she take up the theme again. Her first
calender series shows facets of Javanese culture. Once more she became obsessed by the
variety of culture in her country of birth.

Multiculturalism often raises the question of one’s own identity. In Suriname Kit-
ling envisages the following process of identity formation:

1. The first generations (slaves, immigrants, colonists) bring traditional cultural
expressions from their homeland to the new country.

2. The culture of those in power becomes superior and parts of the other groups
conform to that culture.
3. This is followed by groups promoting the idea of ‘back to the roots’, who strive
towards renewed appreciation of authentic culture
4. Then there are groups that create something new. This might be:
a. A natural process of assimilation. Very often a mixture of different races
and conscious or unconscious experimentation with different cultural
elements.

b. Experimenting with different combinations of 1, 2 and 3.
