Most of the indentured immigrants to the Caribbean came from North India,
primarily Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, while lesser numbers came from South India. The
majority of immigrants to the French territories originated from South India and spoke
Telugu and Tamil. Northern Indian immigrants spoke the Hindi dialects of Bhojpuri,
Urdu and Bengali. The vast majority of these immigrants were Hindus with about ten
percent Muslims. Many factors in India encouraged migrants to leave and seek their
fortunes elsewhere. Severe famines in India were a major factor.

In the early days of indenture, when the passage from India to the Caribbean took
at least three to four months, conditions on the ships were deplorable, resulting in high
mortality rates. Caste endogamy broke down on the plantations as well as on board the
ships which traversed the Middle Passage. Due to the harsh conditions that Indians
faced, they became united in their struggle for survival. Despite these cruel living
conditions, Indians eventually produced a middle class of small farmers and shop owners.

By the time Indentureship ended in 1917, many Indians did not exercise their
option to return to India. They chose, instead, to remain as permanent settlers in the
Caribbean where they got, bought and rented land to do agriculture and rear cows. By
the end of World War Il, those who chose to settle in the colonies easily constituted
about half the population of Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad (and Tobago). They also
formed the largest minority in Jamaica, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and St. Kitts.
Today, they constitute over 15 million in the region, settling in the territories of the
Caribbean from Cuba and Jamaica in the North West to Guyana and Suriname in the
South East. They form a visible ethnic group that has changed the face and form of
culture, religion, music, food, architecture, politics and the economy in the Caribbean.

The social circumstances of the early years were exceedingly difficult. Not only
were Indians thousands of miles from the land of their birth, they also faced an
apprehensive and sometimes hostile host community of non-Indians and non-Hindus.
Despite the loss of many valuable traditions through the death of the elders and the
inability to resist the dominant Afro-European culture, several aspects of Indian cultural
heritage have survived. The growing presence of Indians saw the rise of racial, cultural
and religious trends that has contributed to the creation of a uniquely cosmopolitan
Caribbean society at the beginning of the 2Ist century. Notwithstanding their

impoverished means and limited opportunities, the Indian presence has demonstrated
