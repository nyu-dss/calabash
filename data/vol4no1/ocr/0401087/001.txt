IN THE CARIBBEAN

The abolition of slavery in the early 1830s in the British, French and Dutch
colonies of the West Indies/Caribbean led to a severe shortage of labor in the sugarcane
plantations. The ex-slaves had exercised their right of freedom of choice to discontinue
working on the sugarcane estates even for a wage. The subsequent shortage of labor
served as a catalyst for the introduction of a system of imported contract labor. The
British first introduced laborers from India to the Caribbean through a system of semi-
slave contract labor known as Indentureship. In 1838, Britain brought the first Indian
laborers from the port of Calcutta to British Guiana (now Guyana) based on the success
of the system in Mauritius.

Initially, the Caribbean initiative met resistance since accusations were leveled at
the harsh treatment of the newly-arrived workers. Nevertheless, with lobbying by John
Gladstone and other British planters, the system continued and expanded. It was later
extended to Trinidad and Jamaica [1845] and then to other Caribbean islands like St.
Lucia [1856], St. Vincent [1856], Grenada [1857] and St. Kitts [1861]. The system was also
adopted by the French and Dutch who took Indians to Martinique [1853], Guadeloupe
[1854], French Guyana [1855], St. Croix [1862] and Suriname [1873]. By the time
Indentureship system ended in 1917, about 400,000 Indians came to the Caribbean

colonies, most of whom chose to settle in the islands.
