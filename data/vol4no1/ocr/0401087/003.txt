steady social advancement in every field of endeavor, including literature, law, medicine,
science, business and politics.

The record of achievement of Indians in Trinidad and Guyana is as far as it is
wide. In 1953, Dr. Cheddi Jagan, an Indian of Guyanese birth, a dentist by profession and
leader of the Peoplesâ€™ Progressive Party (PPP), was elected the first Premier of the
Republic of Guyana. However, he was not to last, and given the social and racial
instability of Guyana, was deposed. He wandered in the political wilderness until he was
elected President of the Republic in 1995. Upon his death, Dr. Jagan was succeeded by
his wife Janet Jagan. Currently, Bharat Jagdeo, a PPP member since the age of twelve, is
President of Guyana.

Like Guyana, the glass ceiling to political power was shattered in 1995, when
Basdeo Panday, a trade unionist and Opposition leader with more than 30 years in public
life, became the first Indian to be elected as Prime Minister. His party, the United
National Congress (UNC), with its support mainly from the Indian community,
accomplished the seemingly impossible through an alliance with the Tobago-based
National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) to form the government during 1995 to 2001.
Additionally, during the term of office of the UNC, Kamla Persad Bissessar served with
distinction as the first (Indian) woman to be appointed as Attorney General.

Perhaps the only person who has brought international recognition of the Indian
presence in the Caribbean is the novelist, V.S. Naipaul. He won almost every major
literary award in English in the world including the prestigious Booker Prize. In 1990,
Naipaul was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, and in 2001, he won the distinguished
Nobel Prize for Literature. He has written more than 20 books in the last 45 years, but
perhaps his most popular novel is A House for Mister Biswas, which is based on the author's
early life in Hindu Trinidad. Sir Vidia is the son, older brother, uncle, and cousin of
published authors Seepersad Naipaul, Shiva Naipaul, Neil Bissoondath and Vahni
Capildeo, respectively.

Samuel Selvon is the second most recognized imaginative Indian writer from the

Caribbean after Naipaul. He is known for novels such as A Brighter Sun, The Lonely

Londoners and Moses Ascending. Selvon received numerous awards, including two
