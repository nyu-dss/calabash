At present, six of the country’s eighteen radio stations broadcast Hindi-film and
Indian music. “Radio Shakti” is the last to be launched by the Hindu Credit Union
(HCU). The HCU also publishes a cultural newspaper and plans to produce the region’s
first Indian television station at the end of 2006. The Indian cultural identity has also
been preserved by the importation of movies from Bombay which is the largest film-
producing country in the world. Indians in the Caribbean still flock with their families to
see these movies at their local cinemas that are largely owned by Indians. Many forms of
Indian music have been maintained over the last four generations in the Caribbean. Some
have been lost and others have taken new directions. Chutney is a musical cross-cultural
genre which has been produced and popularized in Trinidad and exported to the
Caribbean Diaspora the world over. More than calypso and soca, chutney represents a

shows are held in the heart of the Carnival season in south Trinidad. Cultural
connoisseurs see chutney as a Carnival fete with a curry flavor, and as an attempt by
Indians to affirm their identity by staging their own style of Carnival as a complement to

resources. The SDMS now has a temple in every community on the island. Indeed, the
visionary Bhadase, who was equally revered as he was reviled, was tireless in his quest to
lift the status of the Hindu community. Today, the SDMS is on par with its other
denominational counterparts in the field of secondary education. The Lakshmi Girls
Hindu Colleges is its flagship, standing shoulder to shoulder with other prestige schools.
With the revision of the Education Concordat, the SDMS has been successful in
establishing three other high schools in the country.

The vociferous Muslim voices include the Anjuman Sunaat ul Association and the
Trinidad Muslim League. Both Islamic bodies have successfully married education and

religion for decades, and their mosques and schools are considered among society’s
