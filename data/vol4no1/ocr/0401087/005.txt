In Trinidad, the Indian heritage had become an integral part of the country’s
lifestyle, and has added significant content and color to the nation’s social and cultural
mosaic. For example, the Hindu festival of Light, Divali (or Deepawali) is a national
public holiday, and despite the difference in theological origin, the celebration finds
favour with the majority of the island’s ethnic groups. Hindus form the second largest
religious group after the Roman Catholics in Trinidad, and Divali is the second largest
national festival in the country after Carnival. It is not surprising therefore that majestic
mandirs adorn the landscape of Trinidad and Guyana. The off-shore temple in the sea at
Waterloo, for example, built by one man with a bicycle, has become a world-famous
tourist attraction. Temples in Guyana have the most varied architectural designs. They
range from ancient single-chamber models made of timber to octagonal shapes made of
concrete with pagoda patterns fashioned after the classical era in India.

Eid-ul-Fitr, the Muslim celebration of Prophet Muhammed (uwbp) is also a
public holiday, enjoying similar national acclaim. Every year, Shiite Muslims
commemorate the death of the grandsons of the Holy Prophet Muhammed by observing
Hosay/Murraham. Participants wheel colorful, glitzy and ornate papier-maché floats
through the streets as part of a solemn procession. Tassa drums are played in a military
style and moon dances are performed during the night procession. Large numbers of
Hindus and Africans participate in this commemoration. In Jamaica, Hosay is one of the
largest national cultural events.

Trinidad is the only Caribbean island with the distinction of celebrating Indian
Arrival Day as a public holiday. The heritage day is observed in commemoration of the
arrival of the first batch of immigrants who arrived on May 30th 1845. The day is marked
with speeches, songs, music and dances and the re-enactment of the historic landing of
the first batch of weary band of pioneers, who had sailed for six months over half of the
world.

The region’s diet is a culinary menu that draws heavily on Indian dishes and
spices. Curry is a popular preparation of almost every kind of dish, and roti | pizza-like

bread| has become a standard staple even in Jamaica. “Doubles,” which is a bara

sandwich made of chick pea and chutney, is indigenous to Trinidad. It is eaten hot and
