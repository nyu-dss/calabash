met a one to match my father. Dealing with him and grandfather day in and day out, as I
did for so many years, was not easy believe me for they did not like too much foolish talk.
Of course, I was a young girl, and maybe I was lonely as you said. I think I must really
have been, for sometimes he and grandfather, when he was not laid low with bad
remembering, would listen to my chattering, not saying much, just nodding or grumbling
until they'd had enough. Then they'd remind me of a chore I had to do like screwing the
cashew seeds off the fruit or getting the cashews ready for stewing if we had a little sugar,
or something like that. But whenever I was cut short and sent to bed to stop me talking
or anything like that, I always felt offended, dismissed, rejected, or some other sad feeling,
Silly isn't it, but I still feel that way sometimes.

I'd make all sorts of secret vows not to speak to them for days other than the
usual necessary daily conversation, which I managed to do sometimes, believe it or not.
But after a while there they'd be again, father and grandfather, smoking pipes both of
them, sitting on the three-legged stools in the clearing, looking at me as though I'd just
said something they hadn't heard, and before I knew what was happening I'd be talking
to them and then the same thing would happen all over again.

Well, as I said, I lived with two strong men who had terrible memories about the
old life about which I knew so little. The men I've met so far aren't like my father and
grandfather, and when I am myself, which I can't help being, of course, after some time, I
notice that I seem to say, maybe even do things, that are not pleasing to the men. Perhaps
it's my voice or my looks or something.

Still, I did get this job and now I'm quite settled, inside myself, I mean, except
when the hot season arrives, like it seems to have done today, and 1 am washing mangoes
for the bowl! on the dining room table, or someone like you reminds me by mentioning
Manantee Lagoon or asks me about the land we used to own in the bush. I think of the
trees, bowed down with green fruit about this time, which surrounded our clearing.

The day when the Confederate soldier entered our clearing, I'd been carrying the
buckets of water and looking at the huge trees near our well, trying to spot a mango that
had turned, for I liked eating half-green mangoes. So that's how I remember it must have
been the mango season that day when I dropped the buckets of water and rushed past

my father and went to my grandfather who was asleep on his cot underneath the room
