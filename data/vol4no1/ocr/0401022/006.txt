window. I told him what was happening outside. He sat up and pushed the wooden
shutter slightly ajar.

What happened next? Oh, by this time, my father and the Confederate soldier
stood quite close to each other in the clearing. At first their voices were low but soon
they were shouting at each other and my grandfather joined in, calling through the
window, ‘That's right, that's right, you tell him.’ My father didn't want to work for the
Confederate soldier every day during every season because he had his own place to tend,
and he had us at home to worry about as I've said.

Father told the Confederate soldier that he wasn't going to work for starvation
wages from before sun-up to after sun down day after day. He told the Confederate
soldier about every bad treatment he had received from him. You won't believe this but

most of those old soldiers are gone now.

There was something in the papers long ago, so I was told, reporting on their
behavior to people living in the bush like we used to do.

Do I want to sell the land? Oh, it’s nothing to do with me now, you know. Oh, no,
Tam sorry to have wasted your time like this. You've come to the wrong person if you are
hopingto buy that piece of land. My father didn't leave the farm to me you know. Well,
he wouldn't, would he? He left it to his grandnephew. I can give you his name if you wish.
A very nice man, very grateful to my father for his good fortune, so unexpected, too, as he

always says. I receive a little consideration from him every now and again. The first year
