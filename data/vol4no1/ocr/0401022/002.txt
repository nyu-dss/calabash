Of course, my father's answers were not always the same. Sometimes he'd say
that grandfather was thinking of his friend who'd been sold down the river, or about my
grandmother who had been crippled by the whip, then worked to death in somebody's
kitchen. I didn't know what to make of those stories, but I decided then and there that if
ever I had children I wouldn't tell them those stories. Gave me nightmares they did.
Sometimes they were so sad, I cried so much I could hardly see. Then my father would
say, â€˜You're so wa-wa, but what can I expect from a girl-child?' He never said so but I
believe that my father wished I had been born a boy.

My mother? Oh, she died a few days after I was born. She was buried out there in
the bush. I've always meant to go back to Manatee, to Gale's Point, to look for her grave,
but I never have done. It is strange, I agree, when there is no one to hold me back, not
now anyway. But all the graves there are covered with grass and high bush.

But all that was a long time ago and I don't think of it much except that as I grow
older, not that lam old, but you know what I mean, memories come upon me when Iam
not thinking about my father at all, like yesterday. There I was in the kitchen getting the
breakfast trays ready for the guests when I looked out the window for some reason or
other, and instead of the old barrack rooms back there I see instead my father standing in
the door of our house in the clearing, looking towards the trailhead where that
Confederate soldier stood, a gun in his hand.

Our house was almost like a shack, you know, but of course I didn't think so then.
It was my home, the only one I knew. There weren't any grand houses in the bush except
for that of the Confederate soldier who lived on ten thousand or more acres or so my
grandfather said, but I had never seen the house and as was my way then, I didn't really
give my grandfather's words much credit. Me? Oh, I slept in a lean-to attached to the
kitchen and father and grandfather slept in hammocks in the big room. There wasn't
much to speak of in it. It had a dirt floor, and a thatched roof which I didn't care for at all.
Snakes and scorpions could hide in the thatch and sometimes did in other people's
houses but not in ours for father, until he died, kept it clear of anything like that.

I kept the dirt floor and the outside clearing swept and Grandad, when he was in
the mood, which was rare as I've said, would help make sure that not a blade of grass
survived in the clearing encircling our house. We were not a careless set of people like

some I could name. We caught fishes in the lagoon, hunted for game, cooked, cleaned and
