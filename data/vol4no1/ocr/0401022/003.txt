grew ground food on our farm, washed our clothes and so on. That took up most of the
day and part of the night, too.

Money? My grandfather didn’t much like it, but sometimes my father hired
himself out to the war families from America who were trying to make plantations, like
the Confederate soldier I was telling you about. The most of them didn't succeed here, as
I hardly need to tell you. As far as I could understand it, they seemed to get angrier by the
day as they saw their efforts come to nothing, again and again.

Everything about the country seemed to make them extremely angry. But like
grandfather said, 'They were slave owners in their own country, and no kin of mine will
ever be a slave again.’ I wondered at grandfather when he said that. After all, as far as I
was concerned, a dollar was a dollar, and there were so many things we needed to buy in
Belize Town. Our clothing was extremely ragged, and patched in every possible place
and when we had a littl money, I was sometimes able to persuade my father to buy
enough cloth for me to make us new clothing.

My father and Grandad never went many miles from our farm, and, and except for
rare occasions, they didn't visit the little nearby settlements. Lonely? I didn't consider it

and deadly weapons if you so much as looked at them the wrong way, or so grandfather
said, but my grandfather had a fighting nature, and was quick to anger himself, so I took
most of his sayings with a grain of salt. But these are some of the things which caused my
heart to beat so fast the day I saw the Confederate soldier enter the clearing.

Of course, by now I had become almost used to seeing the white faces of the
Confederate families at a distance, but I had not yet met any of them up close. The soldier?
Oh, he was not very tall, and not wearing a uniform, as I recall. His mouth was turned
down in the midst of a gray beard. He wore his jacket, a white shirt, with a small collar,
and a black string tie...as far as I remember, and good trousers of course. But as I said, we
called all the men soldiers, for that's what they said they mostly were. In any case, his

face looked as though he smelled something sour in our clearing, and he narrowed his
