eyes when he saw my father. The sun? Well, it could have been against the sun, I grant
you that, which always did seem too bright, and too hot, to me in those days. I very much
doubt it, however, although as I said, it was a long time ago.

No, I can't remember what day it was, nor the month, nor the year. Before time,
out in the bush, it didn't matter what day or year it was, or so it seemed to me. My father
and grandfather usually knew when the season was going to change by looking at the
sky and the trees, and by wetting a finger and holding it up to the breeze. They could tell
you all sorts of things like when the rainy season would start and the dry begin, what
time of day or night special fishes would be in the lagoon, or when it was best to cut
certain trees or plant certain foods, that kind of thing

So as I said, there I was returning from the well carrying two pails of water, one
in each hand, when I saw my father, his face alarmed, then angry, disappear from the
door of our house, only to return with his gun in his hand, staring at the soldier standing
on the path through high bush and trees. My father had his head cocked to one side as
though he was listening to something. I set the pails on the ground and went into the
house through the back door.

I don't know how old I was but I was still what people called a girl, you know,
not old enough to be a young lady or anything of that nature. My father made me dress
like a boy and my hair was cropped close to my head as there were no women near at
hand to do any plaiting. To tell you the truth I seldom remembered I was a girl for I was
tall for my age and strong.

But I remembered sometimes, for my father wouldn't let me lift anything over
heavy, and I couldn't go wandering by myself along the bush paths or near the lagoon like
I sometimes wanted to do. I tried it once but my father gave me such a beating I never
really had the courage to leave the clearing alone again until he and grandfather were
dead. If my father hadn't gotten the rotting sickness, which I wouldn't wish on my worst
enemy believe me, I suppose I'd be there still where I was until long past what people
called the marriageable age.

This hotel? Oh, I've been here now for about five years and I live in hope of
marrying some strong man like my father. There are many good men around this town, or

so people tell me. My one or two friends sometimes point them out to me. But I've never
