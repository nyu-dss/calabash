MY FATHER AND THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIER

In those days? Oh, then we lived in the bush near Manatee Lagoon, at the back of
beyond, so I think of it now. We had a pond, fruit trees too, pineapples, coconuts,
bananas, and what not. Did farming, at least my father did. Yes, I suppose it was peaceful
and quiet, except for snakes and the like, until the Confederate Soldiers came. But I
prefer it here at the Belize Town Hotel. When ships arrive, people come and go asking
me for this and about that, like you are doing now. I see the latest in fashionable things
and hear what's happening in foreign parts, like the end of the war in the States. The
guests are not always to my liking, but I know how to take the good with bad.

I have a room in the servants’ yard along Duck Lane at the back of the hotel. It's
small and noisy. hot, too, during the rainy season, but I prefer it to the bush where I lived
as a girl with my father. He's dead now, of course, God rest his soul, died before my
grandfather did. You'd think my grandfather would've died first seeing that he had
suffered beatings and suchlike when he was a slave before my father was born, and he
was forever complaining about one ailment or another. Of course, he couldn't do much
work about the farm, but my father never seemed to mind.

Whenever I used to ask my father why Grandad didn't give us more of a hand, my
father would say, 'His hands are worn out from squaring mahogany logs on the Haulover
Creek.’ At other times my father would say, "Let him lie there all day if he wants to, he's

probably thinking of his brother hung, then cut up into pieces and burnt as he was.’
