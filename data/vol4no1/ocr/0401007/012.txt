meditative paintings that one could immerse oneself into, and explore that strange state between being
and non-being, before a new life declared and defined itself. I was in a strange, in-between state myself,
having not-so-long-ago experienced the birth of my daughter Ise and, in the same breath, the death of
my marriage....Too soon, I was fighting for custody of my daughter in court in New York while living
eight blocks from Ground Zero. In the darkness of this period, I sought light....And then it dawned on
me that light was before me, emerging from these paintings themselves; the light of their color, the corn

was brought from Africa as “provisioning for the slave ships” and among Caribbean people of African
descent, “parched corn (without salt) was used in Death rituals, the Ashanti regarding asham (sansam)
as special food for the spirits”."”

Henriques’ mixed media (corn kernels) acrylic paintings on canvas mounted on MDF in the

Ceres Series are untitled. The shapes and materials suggest a connection with a past that promises new
