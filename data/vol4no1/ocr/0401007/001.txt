Visual Journeys: The Art of Anna Ruth Henriques

Diana Cooper-Clark

The art work of Anna Ruth Henriques embodies voyages of discovery that explore landscapes
of the heart, mind and soul. Her national, transcultural and autobiographical passages trouble the fixity

In The Taino Series (1994), Henriques connects the exile of Sephardic Jews who were her

ancestors from Spain (Sepharad) and Portugal to the obliteration of the aboriginal Tainos of the
