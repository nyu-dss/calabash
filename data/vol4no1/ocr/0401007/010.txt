long, diverse, multicultural experience.”'’ Jamaicans too bear the imprimatur of hybridity and plurality.
Henriques’ illuminations resonate with the diversified axes of ethnicity, religion, and cultural mores
within the Caribbean diaspora. Educated in a Roman Catholic convent school, Henriques is Jewish and
a descendant of Sephardic Jews, African and Chinese Caribbean people. Christianity and Judaism
cross-pollinate with Obeah animism in Jamaica. In the last images of The Book of Mechtilde, “Duppy
Prayer’, death has come to Mechtilde except there is no peace yet for mother and daughter, just
sleeplessness, fear of self, and dread of the “Duppy Kingdom’. (Figure 9) A duppy is a restless ghost
or spirit of the dead, and often associated with Obeah. It is seen as both an “evil spirit” and a “good”
spirit, sometimes called an ancestral being who continues to “take an interest in the welfare of the
family”.'* Mechtilde’s daughter looks away from the flying figure of her mother whose claw-like hand
encircles the former’s head like a questionable halo. Significantly, iconographic motifs in Hebrew
illuminated manuscripts avoid the delineation of God with the use of rays of light usually indicating the
presence of the Almighty. Likewise, Mechtilde’s face is repeatedly crowned by a nimbus of light, with
rays of yellow, orange, red and blue radiating out into infinity and the words of the Book of Job.
However, there are no emanating rays of light from this image of Mechtilde but her daughter looks
toward the Jewish Star of David on her robe and the former’s head is at the top of a Christian Cross.
The peace of Jesus must come after, not before, the “‘fright-filled” Duppy Kingdom. This journey is not
about antithetical theologies, but part of the process from pain and loss to healing. The Kingdom of
God unites the religions of Mechtilde’s Jamaican sphere, Judaism, Christianity and Obeah. Finally,
Mechtilde and her daughter can “rest”. As Mechtilde lies in her coffin, (Figure 10) the rays of light

return, emanating from her in yellow and gold. In the end, she is enveloped by the words of Job to his

Jewish God as he finally recognizes the correlation between affliction, recognition and revelation (Job

42: 1-6).
