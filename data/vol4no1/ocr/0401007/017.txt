The sheer monumentality of Anna Ruth Henriques’ oeuvre is one exemplar of the
preeminence, power and vigor of Caribbean art in the contemporary world. Even though Jamaica is her
hearthstone, her vision integrates the disparate pieces of Old and New World culture.** Public and
private myth are fused. Her art work has been exhibited in the Caribbean, the United States, England,
Venezuela, and Germany. The splintered and multifaceted nature of the Caribbean identity requires
recognition that the instability and mutability of identities are continuously reconstituted. The act of
creation in Henriques’ art work is a Jewish matzeva, an invisible tombstone, erected to those whose

voices have been silenced by a history of domination. Her art speaks for those who cannot.
