of her illuminations. Nonetheless, lurking above the explosion of brilliant pigments, is a sky that still
“carries a shade of grey.”'®

In 1997, the original art work from The Book of Mechtilde was shown at the Jewish Museum in
New York. The flat pages of the book still capture the intensity of the illuminations displayed in
circular or rectangular box frames. Henriques’ work is consistently remarkable for its use of color,
achieved by means of saturated acrylic and watercolor tones. Around each graphic, she imprinted
passages from the Biblical text in gold ink. Clearly, Gothic and Byzantine illumination have influenced
Henriques. Yet her work also reflects ties to Hebrew manuscript painting. The idea that Jews did not
reproduce images is a persistent one. However, Hebrew illustrated manuscripts and Jewish prayer
books were frequently decorated with figurative art which was further replicated in Christian art.
Metaphorically, the words from the Book of Job are like a labyrinth. The first verses that enfold the
images of Mechtilde’s life, the center of the maze, leads the viewer, not to intricate passageways and
blind alleys but to the ways in which Job’s story commingles with Mechtilde’s. At the outer rim, the
particular chapter and verse from the Book of Job is cited and beside it is Henriques’ initials “ARH
1992”. Job, mother and daughter share this life-altering journey. The practice of having the letters
themselves form the shape central to the illumination appears to be distinctive to Hebrew manuscripts
in which the ideographic images summarized elements of medieval Jewry’s spiritual experience.'!
Geometric contours, floral designs, animal and human figures were regularly found in Hebrew
manuscripts of Christian Europe. Similarly, the outer framing of Henriques’ work, which is an aesthetic
geometry, is patterned in gold with the natural and spiritual topography of Jamaica, tropical flowers,
fauna, fish, and shell shapes that remind the viewer of the all-seeing eye.

Since “Mechtilde lived in a land of songmakers” where “‘in times of joy, the music rejoiced”

and “in times of sorrow, the music wept”!”, there is a synchronous relationship that binds people’s lives
