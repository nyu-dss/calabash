“early tourists” would have gathered exotic objects for Isabella. Consequently, within The Boxes are
artifacts which recall the Taino people who were conquered and eventually extinguished by the
Europeans. The Boxes, therefore, represent an act of sympathetic and artistic archaeology.

The twelve Giclée plates of The Exodus Series (2002) are a “visual meditation on the theme of
exile incorporating iconic imagery’, using a digital pen and downloaded internet materials. Henriques
went to Seville, Spain in 1992 as Design Coordinator of the Jamaica Pavilion at the Universal
Exposition planned to coincide with the 500-year celebrations of Columbus’ departure to the New
World. On the last night for Jews on Spanish soil, August 2, 1492, Columbus and his crew probably

the marranos (secret Jews) and openly practicing Jews who shared in Columbus’ ‘discovery’ of the
New World, like Henriques’ ancestors, have fallen through the cracks of history. In Spain, her family’s
history became visceral and concrete. Although Columbus sought new territories and gold, he returned
with other riches such as spices and, specifically cocoa. Henriques had taken a dozen Jamaican
chocolate bars to Seville and she saved the gold wrappers of those chocolate bars, collecting souvenirs
of coins and a Portuguese tourist brochure. She arranged her collections on canvas boards in
iconographic forms. They were memorials that had the power to synthesize in a single composite
image the ‘Old World’ of her family, and a celebration of the ‘New World’ of Jamaica.

The centerpieces are digitized images of West Indian ‘gold’: the wrappers of Jamaican
chocolate bars, representing cocoa and cane sugar. Within the centerpieces are emblems from an
official Portuguese tourist brochure, as well as the Spanish coins. Markings of Moorish pre-Inquisition,
Spain, form borders while other Caribbean spices serve as background, as does a burlap bag of
Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee. Various reproductions of 16" century Caribbean maps weave

throughout the layers comprising the images, as does the first page of the original Inquisition
