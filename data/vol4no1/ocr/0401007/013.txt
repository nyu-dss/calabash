imaginings. The name Demeter is etymologically linked to motherhood, female sexuality and rebirth.
The Greek meter is ‘mother’ and de is a female genital sign known as “the letter of the vulva’. In many
traditions, doorways were sacred to women and painted red. In Demeter’s center at Mycenae, the
doorways of tombs signified the womb of the Goddess which promised the possibility of rebirth.'* In
her Untitled (Red/Green), (Figure 11) Henriques places a solid, square mass of red paint and corn
kernels in a border of green. The opaque square
evokes a door that is heavy and secure in its
foundations. Against the surrounding green, the border
is not an obstruction but an entrance into a world that
embraces the fertility of nature and Mother Earth. The
vibrant red of blood and the deep green are passages
between the life-giving principle as well as death. The
color symbolism in Henriques’ work transcends a

specific cultural heritage and locates her mythology

 

transnationally. Green is emblematic of life but it is
also a depiction of death for the Egyptians who painted Osiris (the god of vegetation and of the dead)
green.”

Like The Book of Mechtilde, the Ceres Series is “meditative”, a medium that one can
“immerse” oneself into, as Henriques has written. Untitled (White/White) (Figure 12) places an oval or
spheroid shape, rich with the consistency of corn, in a field of varying hues of white. Behind the surface
of white on white, small dots of pale pink and red barely emerge, reinforcing the resemblance to the
vulva. A comparison could be made to Baubo, the maidservant who, “‘completely baring her abdomen
