Her mother was convinced Hannah was having a sudden flu attack. She brought
her an aspirin and a hot water bottle. Hannah tucked the bottle between her thighs,
braving the heat to the very last.

The following Saturday, she rushed from her job at the senior home to Americain
on Leidseplein. She sat at a table near the door. In the middle of the establishment was a
reading table covered with newspapers from around the world, English, French, German,
Italian. The chairs were covered in red velvet, she hadn’t noticed that on her first visit,
and once again she was impressed with the tables with Persian rugs on them. So
sumptuous! This wasn’t just a bar; revolutionaries, left-wing writers and intellectuals
came here. She’d read so in the paper.

She drank a cup of tea, set down a book in front of her as an excuse, and, feeling
out of place, turned to her surroundings for support. Thoughts of Gideon haunted her.
He was her promised land. She did not dare approach the reading table. No women sat at
It.

The next Wednesday Gideon was not at Haporzim, the Zionist youth

organization. She didn’t like it there, and the topic, assimilation versus exile, was
confusing and incomprehensible. It turned out that an assimilated person was depraved,
a traitor, whereas Hannah, with Surinam in mind, had thought that assimilation was an
achievement.
Someone called out that galut, exile, was the same as masochism... There was only one
answer, off to Palestine and all help build the country. Hannah withdrew from the
discussion. What was she supposed to say? She couldn't follow. At home she’d look up
masochism in the dictionary. Fortunately no one asked her anything. Afterwards she
rushed to Americain. It was virtually empty. She ordered tea. That was cheapest.

A black man was sitting by the window. He silently was staring into space. She
found out it was him when the waiter brought her a drink: from Mr Baldwin, the writer.
She had nodded shyly to James Baldwin. He nodded back and smiled. What was the next
step? Should she go over to him, sit down at his table? What then? What was she
supposed to say to an older man, her father’s age, perhaps older, who was world famous?
What were the rules? She peaked at him quickly. He could have been a Dankerlui.
Bulging eyes. Heavy eyelids, wide mouth. A long upper lip. The colour... All the other

customers were white.
