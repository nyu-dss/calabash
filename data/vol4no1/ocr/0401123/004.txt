school. I don’t like to see her do that. Hannah can save for the journey from her wages,
can’t she? We don’t have to pay. She’ll earn it herself”

‘For a start [ don’t like to see my daughter exploited by other people. What it
comes down to is that you're a kind of labourer, in a work camp, even if it’s only for a
limited time and of your own free will,’

‘Man, youre acting as if your daughter is ending up as a coolie subject to penal
sanctions. Okay, so she’ll be working the land. What’s wrong with that? She thundered
