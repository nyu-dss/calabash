bugger off and knock on the doors of their Arab brothers. Israel was the home of the Jews
and no one else.

Hannah hoped she would not be taken for an Arab woman in Israel. She yearned
for love letters, not for the unromantic political diatribes that Gideon wrote in Dutch.
Gradually the letters became scarcer. She longed for him, was consumed with desire,
threw herself into Hebrew.

She had to pay the association three hundred guilders to cover the cost ofa three-
month stay in Israel. After two years of working she had been able to put aside half that
amount. Then her mother decided overnight that she must pay for her keep and
henceforth must buy her own clothes.

‘Why? asked Hannah.

‘Because,’ replied Mrs Dankerlui sternly.

‘Tl never get to Israel like this.’

‘Where there’s a will there’s a way,’ said her mother nonchalantly.

Hannah had gained a place at high school. She was an excellent student and was in her
last year. The wages at Beth Shalva had remained the same. The rent was raised by two
and a half guilders.

One Wednesday afternoon the telephone went. Hannah was in her room
studying. At three o’clock she was due to go to Haporzim, report there and then as usual
set off for Americain to indulge her daydreams.

‘Hannah’ Mrs Dankerlui sounded alarmed. ‘There’s a man on the telephone for
you.’

‘T’ve got to speak to you urgently,’ said Gideon.

Hannah was speechless. She hadn’t heard a word from Gideon for ages. She
pulled herself together, and just for something to say asked if it was something serious.
He couldn’t say over the phone.

Mrs Dankerlui looked on frowning while her daughter telephoned. ‘Who is it?”
she whispered.

‘Someone from Haporzim, replied Hannah with her hand over the mouthpiece.

‘W hat does he want?’

‘T’ve got to hang up, Gideon,’ said Hannah. ‘See you later, at Haporzim.’
