out in his room with the door locked, remarked that it would be good for his sister to do
some scouting of that kind. ‘Otherwise she’ll turn into a blue stocking. And who knows,
our patapouf may lose some weight from working on the land,’ he added, ‘and get a
boyfriend.’

‘She can put that right out of her head, his mother laughed.

After months of deliberation Mr Dankerlui came round. Hannah was lying in her
room one evening listening to her parents’ conversation. ‘Okay!’ she heard him say, ‘I
won't make this a life or death issue. As far as I’m concerned she can go, but only if she
learns the language first. Then she can get by. It’s a bloody difficult language, impossible
to learn at short notice. Anyway, I’ve bought her something. Look.’

‘What a huge tome, that’ll keep her busy for the time being, said her mother. ‘You
must be thinking that while she’s preparing she'll still be at home...’

The next day her father gave Hannah Leon Uris’s Exodus as a present.

Hannah started Hebrew lessons with the wife of a rabbi from Buitenveldert in
order to familiarise herself with the Jewish religion. She was impressed by the pious
woman. The house exuded harmony, there was a smell of steeped plums, boiled
chestnuts and fresh bread. The woman taught her with the patience of a saint, praising
Hannah on every word she acquired. All the money she earned went on what she called
her Jewish training. There was nothing left for gramophone records.

She was having a hard time at Haporzim. She felt as if she were being observed,
an outsider. There was talk of the Jewish identity, and spiteful things were said about
non-Jews. Someone suggested that people without a Jewish background should be
excluded. ‘Religious faith and origin are one.’ Differences with outsiders were blown up,
mutual differences brushed under the carpet. Outsiders meant everyone who was not a
Jew. You were Jewish if your mother was Jewish. ‘Don’t be such a goy,’ was a taunt. She
learned. At home she looked up goy in the dictionary: non-Jew, foreigner. And she also
found the meaning of matrilineal, shikse, orel... If you want to belong you have to adapt.
Hannah put a dusting of Zwitsal talcum on her face. Richenel commented that it made
her look just like the negative of Al Jolson. He wanted nothing to do with his sister’s
antics; thought what he called her Jewish flirtation ridiculous. She in turn threw the

insult goy in his face.
