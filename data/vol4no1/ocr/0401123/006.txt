Her father did not come up at Haporzim. And just as well too. He seemed to be
moving more and more into the militant black camp, and that was hard to reconcile with
Judaism. He once said that wives of Jewish slave owners were cruel, and mentioned the
abuses of a certain Sarah de la Parra.

Crueller than who?” Mrs Dankerlui said that those abuses likely had been
recorded by hypocritical Christians. Hannah’s strive to come out as a Jewess had turned
the living room into a stifling forum. She could not bear to think of someone from the
association witnessing her parents’ discussions. None of the members of the association
ever came to her house. Home and Haporzim were separate worlds. She counted herself
fortunate in her mother’s origins. Without her she would never have had the chance to
enrich her Jewish spirit. But she could not free herself from her father’s background.

For her fifteenth birthday she asked for a Star of David. She was given a golden
one, openwork, the size of a two-and-half-guilder coin. She would have liked to wear it
on her coat in winter where it could be seen, so that people could place her. She became
impressed by the solidarity of the young Zionists. They were like one big family. Self-

It was emphasised that in a Jewish environment, one could automatically acquire

help her progress. She read and read, but the gap in her knowledge was unbridgeable: the
more she got to know about the history of the diaspora, the more she realised she knew
very little, as if she were on a conveyor belt moving in the opposite direction.

Hannah was a head taller than the other members of Haporzim, and however
small she tried to make herself, people looked up to her. She did a folk dancing course.
The boys fought over her, and when they danced in a circle reached on tiptoe for her
shoulders to lean on them heavily.

The dance teacher was critical: Hannah swivelled her hips too much. It should be
more stylised: ‘This is not Africa. Less bum!’ Homework! At home she practised ‘Hava
Nagilal’. The rhythm did not fit in with the rumba at which she excelled, a South
American shuffle, in which the continents of Africa, America and Europe merged into a
single music. Mrs Dankerlui encouraged her to rehearse the steps separately. She

demonstrated. ‘That’s how I learned the Charleston in the old days,’ she said, leaning on
