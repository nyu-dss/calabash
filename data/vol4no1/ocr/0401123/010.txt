He suggested going for a walk. He put a hand on her shoulder and led her in the
direction of Vondelpark. He was breathing slightly heavily, as if climbing a mountain. He
looked different, burdened. ‘I’ve got to tell you something,’ he said, stroking her shoulder.
‘T've got to get married’

‘That’s impossible. I’m far too young,’ replied Hannah in embarrassment.
