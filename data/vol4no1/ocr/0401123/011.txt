to that woman in her moth-eaten wig. If she ever wore a wig it would be in the style of
Tina Turner or Aretha Franklin!

She was startled when a man, resting his hands on the table, leaned over to her.
He was wearing a short leather jacket with the collar turned up. Her first thought was:
Mick Jagger. He looked like him. Thick, pouting lips, piercing blue eyes, curly hair
hanging halfway down his shoulders.

‘Is it good? he said in a low voice. He sat down opposite her. ‘Shit, you’re
gorgeous. Drop-dead gorgeous! You'd think God exists. What’s your name...? Where have
you been all my life?” He gave her a penetrating look, took hold of her hand that lay
limply on the table and said softly, ‘You’re waiting for me, true or false” Hannah’s body
reacted violently at that moment, which might be decisive for the rest of her life. She ran
a timid glance over him. There were two buttons missing from his jacket. His
unmanicured nails marked him as someone who neglected himself. She trembled at the
thought that this man opposite her might not be the man she was waiting for, but was
certainly all she was going to get. Chaim.
