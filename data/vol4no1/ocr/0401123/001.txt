EXCERPT FROM THE NOVEL NEGERJOOD IN MOEDERLAND
(BLACK JEW IN MOTHERLAND)

Translated from the Dutch by Paul Vincent

The extract below reflects the dichotomy of Hannah’s cultural background in a scene in which she has a
date with Gideon, whom she met at the Zionist youth movement. While she is waiting in Café American
for Gideon, an older black man sends a drink to her table - with compliments of Mr. Baldwin, the
American writer. At the end of this sample translation the reader is introduced to the young man, whom

Hannah will end up marrying.

Gideon ordered rissoles and beer. She had an orange juice.

‘You're rather quiet,’ said Gideon, downing the steaming snack. ‘I like a woman to
show a bit of initiative.’

A woman? She was only just fourteen, but he didn’t know, he mustn’t know. Oh
God, initiative, how do you do that? She stared at the table rug’s pattern. Her head spun,
she couldn’t breathe, fought back a sigh, and thought she would faint.

Gideon told her he always drank at Café Americain. In two weeks’ time he was
off to Israel. He asked whether Hannah was going on holiday. She shook her head,

apologized, and said she had to leave as she had forgotten an appointment. At home she

crawled into bed, desperately in love.
