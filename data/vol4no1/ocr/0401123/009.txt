‘At the gate of the Rijksmuseum, next to the entrance, said Gideon hurriedly, ‘at
two o’clock. Not at the association!’
Hannah rang off.

‘Odd conversation. | thought that only young people were members of that club.
That wasn’t a boy’s voice, it was the bass of a full-grown man.’

‘It was one of the leaders. We've got to be there on time. He had to pass on the
message.’

‘It runs until five o’clock, doesn’t it?” asked Mrs Dankerlui suspiciously. ‘1 want
you back by a quarter to six on the dot.’

Mrs Dankerlui did not know that Hannah seldom went to the association any
more. She turned up only to provide herself with an alibi and left shortly afterwards. She
paid her membership fee. But the time intended for the club, the time she had gained, she
spent in Americain, submerged in anonymity. Whenever possible at that special table
where she had sat for the first time with Gideon.

Once her eye was caught by EBONY in the kiosk at Americain. She was struck by
the photo of three confident, carefully coiffed, sexy women on the cover and read:
Surinam Multiracial Paradise at the Crossroads. She bought the magazine. In the bus
home she read the article. The writer had never encountered such a multiracial society.
Hannah looked at the colour photos of people who made up the Surinamese population:
blacks, Hindus, Javanese, Chinese, creoles, moksi’s. She observed her fellow-passengers
in their grey winter clothing. She fell into a trance of homesickness. When she got off she
realised she had left the magazine on the bus. At home she crawled into bed, her
consolation, and that afternoon she skipped Hebrew class. The lessons had been getting
nowhere recently. She felt sorry for the rabbi’s wife. In the space of two years she had
had three children, including a pair of twins. She now had nine of them. She looked tired,
pitiable. One of her canine teeth was missing. Her shapeless grey wig was too large for
her pale sunken face. The house smelled musty. The woman was no longer a model, and
orthodoxy began to repel Hannah. This atavistic religion was diametrically opposed to
the age she was living in, the 1960s.

Gideon’s phone call threw Hannah into uncertainty. Time had diluted her

yearning for him. Now he turned up again. Eretz Israel!
