PEANUT MAN

Peanut Man, lift ya bag high in the air

and preach ya revolution

like choir

or like when shore roll up

and kiss up

and sex up silver sand

Preach it loud

“Dollar, Dollar’ fuh the roast cashew

that taste like it just come from oven red sting
when it ain't

How he make it?

Make what?

The peanut, man, the peanut

It come from the tree

Peanut man say that’s the way it should be
oven, them, they make in Miami

all the money, say, going there already
Revolution, he preach

Where?

Down Nassau street, Bay Street

With pink English building and Victoria stare
She lookin’ at us

Rope round she belly like Judas lynch

You silly, gal?

Silly what?

Peanut man in the middle of the road

And what he doin?

Selling the bags for dollar?

And what that have to do with revolution?
Look how he skin dutty, he head all dred-up
