recognized the face of the lady from the night before who had stood with her arms
spread in the light and accompanied me up the steps. She drew me with her. I followed
her to a small room. She gestured and | understood that she wanted me to undress myself
and that | had to wash.

Perhaps it was because she turned on the tap that came out of the wall and

'Well child, she asked me when I was dressed and had come downstairs. 'Have
you cleansed yourself properly?’ She already had the comb at the ready. ‘Come, let me
quickly tidy your hair.’ She liked combing and plaiting my hair. When she was finished I
set the table in the dining room while she prepared banana meal porridge for breakfast.

Mr and Mrs Miskin ate at the large table in the dining room. They took breaktast
at quarter past six. On Sundays as well. | ate first in the scullery. Before starting to eat |
