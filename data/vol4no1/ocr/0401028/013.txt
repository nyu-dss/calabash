chance to stretch my legs at the same time,’ he said. ‘That had gone by the board because
of the festivities.’

I took the ring and the handkerchief upstairs to my bedroom. I carefully packed
the ring into an empty matchbox. | pulled the red case out from under my camp bed,
opened it with one of the two keys that were tied to the handle with a string, and put the
box and the handkerchief with the rest of my things.

The case was my very first possession. The day after | arrived at her house in the
city, Mrs Miskin gave it to me as a gift. All my possessions were stored away in it: my
Sunday dress, the three dresses for weekdays. ‘One in the wardrobe, one to wash and one
to wear, was the Dutch adage Mrs Miskin brought me up with but there were always
two neatly starched and ironed dresses in the case.

The Miskins had waited for a child for a long time. ‘From my own flesh and
blood,’ as Mrs Miskin was wont to say. But the Dear Lord ordained otherwise. It can't
have been because of me. They turned me inside out, just like a fish, and there was
nothing the matter.’ | always had to think of Mrs Miskin inside out when | cleaned the
fish on Fridays. It was one of the household duties she had taught me.

Every Friday around one o'clock Mai, the fishwife, came by with a big basket on

her head in which the fish lay, protected from the sun by a banana leaf. 'Warapa, trapoen,
koebi, she would call through the street.

Mrs Miskin bought a koebi. She taught me how to cut open the fish's belly. First, |
had to sharpen a knife on the whetstone. Then I had to stick the point of the knife in the
small hole in the middle of the belly. In one movement, I had to pull it through to the
gills. Under the skin, not too deeply. The innards had to be removed from the intestinal
cavity with their membrane intact. | carefully extracted the koebi-stone from out of the

head. Mrs Miskin had a collection of these white stones. Around her neck she wore a

gold necklace. The pendant was a koebi-stone set in gold.

The fish had to be divided into three pieces. The head piece was for me, the tail
for Mrs Miskin and the fleshy middle chunk for Mr Miskin.

The Miskins' house was on Hofstede Crull Avenue, in the Combé neighbourhood.
‘I'm still trying to find the works of this poet from our Golden Age,’ said Mrs Miskin.
