her story. The history of the reversed names was from long ago, from the time when there
were still slaveholders.

‘If I told you how we were mishandled and humiliated in former days.’ She made a
face as if she were trying to suppress afterpains. ‘Like a cancer, the worm of slavery
gnawed at every budding sprout which, with proper care, could have contributed to the
blossoming and prosperity of our country. You can get down on your bare knees and
thank our Dear Lord that you didn't live in those times.’

On my bare knees | thanked the Lord with full submission.

She taught me the poems of Van den Vondel and Speenhoff, the Dutch national
anthem. | learnt everything off by heart and gradually made Mrs Miskin's language my
own.

‘There are, she once said solemnly, ‘two beautiful things in this world:
remembering and forgetting. And two ugly things: remembering and forgetting. | didn't
make that up myself, she smiled, ‘but it's something | could have made up myself.’ |
thought it a pretty saying and repeated the words to myself. Mrs Miskin was like a radio
that was on all day, quiet but clearly audible. She was my background music. | was her
only audience. We were in tune with each other.

Mrs Miskin was big. She had shining black hair that she wore in a bun over
which she stretched a gossamer thin hairnet. She wore beautiful dresses with lace
collars. Gold bracelets tinkled on her wrists. When she spoke she stood straight, her
head slightly raised. As people do when giving a recital.

Mr Miskin had no time for her rhymes and what he called her verbal flood. He
was small, a good bit smaller than his wife, and stout. It seemed as if his head had been
dropped onto his shoulders froma great height so that his neck had shot into his trunk.
The back of his head was like a sloth’s. Mr and Mrs Miskin lived together politely. They
never touched each other. At home they avoided each other. When she spoke to him he
answered without looking up from the book he was reading, so that it looked as if he
were reading out loud. If he happened not to be reading he looked downwards while
speaking, as if studying his knees or the ends of his shoes.

‘Do me a favour, he said when Mrs Miskin had been speaking for too long.

‘Words, words, I can't bear all this racket.’
