When I was finished she got up off the stool and said: ‘Sit down.’ [ sat down and
draped the towel over my lap. Mr Miskin turned onto his side. His eyes were closed. |
started on the other hand.

‘T'll leave Mr Miskin in your hands for this from now on. | couldn't do it better

Mr Miskin valued regularity. After his lunch and before his rest hour he liked
