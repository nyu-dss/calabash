sat there and Jules Chok Fung Yen, a boy with baggy deep-blue shorts and knobbly
knees. Jules came from China. He was far advanced in arithmetic and could multiply and

divide large numbers at top speed. He didn't speak any Dutch and in Paramaribo he had

to start at the beginning with Does and Mies. But mostly he just slept with his head on his
hands and softly snored.

New children came to the school and others disappeared. | remember Jopie. She
sat by herself at the back of the class. She told me about her family who lived on the
plantation New Refound, about her little brothers and her granny. Now she was a
fosterling with Mrs Mendesohn. But she missed her mother so much that she'd already
run away from the Mendesohns' a few times. She couldn't find her way back home. |
asked her how long she had lived with her foster mother. She said: "Two months.’ Mrs
Mendesohn had threatened her with Youthripen, the children's prison. For a long time |

If Jopie ran away again she'd be locked up in there. Then she'd never see her
mother again. In class she stared straight ahead or lay with her head on her arms and
slept. Just like Jules Chok Fung Yen. Sometimes it was Jopie's turn to go to the front of
the class. Sister called her Sleeping Beauty and asked her to recite the two times table.
Jopie stood up slowly, dragged her feet all the way to the front and then bowed her head
and said nothing. Sister Victorine said: ‘There are whole tribes that will never learn.’
Jopie went back to her place at the back of the class and silently stared into space.

The school books had pretty pictures in them. Of Ot and Sien and Trui. Children
who aged a year with every new book. They weren't precocious. But they were very far

away in an unreachable world. We of St Peter's School could never be like them. We

were from a different world. The things that happened to Of and Sien and the other
