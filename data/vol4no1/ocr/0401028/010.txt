After first arriving in the house of my foster parents, | slept on a woven mat on
the floor. Mr and Mrs Miskin slept in two beds. In the mornings, when | helped Mrs
Miskin with the housework before going to school, we made the beds and I noticed how
she tied them together with a shining cord around their bars. She always did that herself.
One Saturday | was allowed to accompany Mrs Miskin to Happy Day, the department
store where she made her large purchases.

‘A sleeping mat is for a plantation, said Mrs Miskin, ‘we're going to make a fine
city lady out of you.’ She bought a camp bed for me. ‘Later, when you've grown up, you
shall sleep in a proper bed like Mr Miskin and I. When you have reached that stage. But

Remorse which she told me with great enthusiasm. Long, long ago, when slaveholders
still had slaves, the plantation I came from was the property of the wealthy Du Plessis
family. Mr Du Plessis was an incorrigible lady's man and his wife a jealous spouse who
watched over her husband like a kidnapper guarding his victim. She traced all his
movements and noticed that he spent a noticeably large amount of time in the vicinity of
a certain house slave, Etrave. One time the jealous Mrs Du Plessis saw how her husband,

in an attempt at seduction, casually stroked the young slave's breasts as he passed her.
The mistress was furious. She was in charge in the house. With such behaviour the

slaveholder undermined her authority. Outside he could go his own way and let his

bestial drives run free. But inside the house her rules applied. She summoned the

plantation flogger and ordered him to chop off the young slave's breasts. That would
