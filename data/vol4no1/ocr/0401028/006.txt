word of complaint about the Moravian Church.’ On Sundays Mr and Mrs Miskin parted
company. Each visited their own church.

At first my vocabulary was limited to ‘please’ and 'thank you’, and ‘sir’ and
madam, but very soon I had learnt to speak impeccable Dutch.

At the St Peter's School I was allowed to skip the infants’ class.

‘What an intelligent girl that is,’ said Sister Victorine to Mrs Miskin who had
been asked to come to the school fora talk. And knowing that she's a fosterling. She's so
precocious, I've never had one like that before. In general these children are quite

The first, second and third class were combined. There was a boy called Sobha in
my class. He was so big he already had a moustache. Once when he had to read the Dutch

speak when they're spoken to.’

I didn't need to ask any questions. Mrs Miskin schooled me at home to such a
degree that | was very soon using language in a way that had nothing to do with the
world of my school books.

I sat in the place of honour, at the front. My school desk was up against Sister's
own. The white skin of her face almost formed a whole with the yellowed cap of her
habit.

In the morning I was allowed to hand out the slates and slate pencils. At the back
of the class were the big children and the children on whom, according to Sister, school

was wasted, because their heads were filled with everything except good sense. Sobha
