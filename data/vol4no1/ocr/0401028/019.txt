And I continued: ‘Because the continual manipulation of the cuticles makes them
thick and tough, they must be pushed back every morning with a lime stick.

Go on,’ she ordered. ‘Eugenio!’

Mr Miskin appeared in the doorway. ‘What's got into you, woman? You're
screaming like a griot.’

‘My efforts have borne fruit. Read my child, read loudly.’

And | read the story again and emphasized the syllables clearly, just as Mrs
Miskin had taught me to do.

Mr Miskin stood in the doorway and listened.

‘Well, what do you think? I promise you that within a week she'll know this text
off by heart.’ She clapped her hands with joy.

‘She has talent, that's for sure,’ said Mr Miskin. His eyes wandered from my head

After a week I could say the text in my sleep.

Around about that time I was given a file, a pot of salve, a fingerbow! and a sheet
of emery paper.

‘I'm pleased that you're single handedly taking over some of my domestic chores,’
said Mrs Miskin. She gave me an empty biscuit tin to keep my hand things in. THE

bed, his eyes closed. Mrs Miskin sat on a small bench and | knelt down beside her.

towel on her lap. She took his thumb. | was allowed to pass the instruments.

‘Here, you do it,’ she said unexpectedly one afternoon.

The thumb felt thick. | hesitated and held the stiff thumb awkwardly between
my fingers.

‘Don't look so scared, child,’ she said, 'that thumb won bite you.’

‘Well?’ She looked at me expectantly and pressed the nail file into my hand.

Don't hesitate.’

I followed her instructions. Mr Miskin neither moved nor spoke.
