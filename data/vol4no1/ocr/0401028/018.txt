Flapping the book she came over to me. ‘Read out loud,’ she said. In decorative
letters was written: DIARY. ‘In this book you can note all the trials and tribulations of
everyday life. One tends to so quickly forget,’ she said.

Miss Treurniet gave me a gift of a pencil. Together we spent most of the festive
afternoon sitting silently in the front room where the copper had been polished and the
chairs rubbed until they shone.

Miss Treurniet had left, Mr Miskin had accompanied her on her way. To stretch
his legs.

‘| have another little something for you,’ she said when we were alone. 'In a way
it's a bit of a present from me to you. But in the end effect, the hand that feeds you, Mr
Miskin, will benefit the most from it.’ She gave me a book and opened it at the first page.
‘Read that, child,’ she said.

‘The first tips for daily hygiene,’ | read. Tip one: Irrespective as to whether the
hand is attractive or unattractive, the correct handling of the nails and their careful
trimming and polishing gives every hand, good or bad, the appearance of good breeding.’

‘Magnificent,’ she interrupted. ‘Carry on like that.’

I read on: 'One begins by filing the nails when they are dry and hard, after which it is
necessary to soak them. The best nail file is a flexible, strong, thin file, without any hand
grip. File around the corners carefully and endeavour to penetrate into the corners
themselves. '

‘Marvellous Hannah, go on.’ Delighted, she clapped her hands.

I hesitated. ‘Further,’ she said.

And I continued. ‘After the cuticle has been cleaned and loosened, it must be
cautiously but firmly pressed into place. A short length of lime stick is all that is needed
for good nail maintenance and its regular use will ensure that the cuticle knife, a
dangerous instrument outside of the hands of experts, does not need to be employed.’

Eugenio,’ She called.

I started, and stopped reading. She had heard Mr Miskin coming home.

‘Eugenio, a surprise.’

Mr Miskin did not appear.

‘Carry on.’
