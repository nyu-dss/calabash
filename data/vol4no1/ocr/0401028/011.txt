teach her to make eyes at her husband. Boiling with rage, she personally fried up the
breasts for her husband.

‘Human meat,’ she interrupted the story, ‘apparently has a very delicate taste. It

can be compared to lean pork.’ Fortunately I had never eaten pork. It was treef to Mrs
Miskin so we never had it in the house.

Silently the couple sat down to their meal, she continued the story. ‘The man
clearly enjoyed it and smacked his lips heartily.

‘Superb,' he said, praising his wife's culinary art.

‘Well then,’ she said, when the meal was finished and the man had uttered a
satisfied belch, ‘I hope you've finally had your full. You just ate the breasts of your
beloved Etrave.'

The man stood up, with his knees bent he tried to support himself on the edge of
the table. He tore the buttons off his shirt and grabbed at his throat. All he could get out
was vomit. It was like the explosion of Krakatoa. First, the steaming undigested food
came out, one thick mush. Then the gall-coloured fluid and finally seething foam. He
couldn't stop vomiting. He fell down and vomited out his heart and his soul. Mrs Du
Plessis looked down with horror at her dying husband.

‘Oh God, my Lord," she called out in despair, ‘what have | done?’ Her spite had
made way for remorse.

‘Well, she said, because a silence had fallen, what do you think of that?’

‘T don't know,’ I answered.

Of course you don't know. It was long before your time.’

On the twenty-second of February attention was drawn to my existence in my
foster parents’ house. | can still clearly remember the first celebration of the anniversary
of my arrival. The copper in the hall was cleaned, the Viennese wooden furniture was
waxed, the floorboards oiled.

‘It is, said Mrs Miskin solemnly, 'a memorable day.’ She had made orgeat and

baked a viado. | accompanied her to Happy Day, the department store where she went

shopping on Saturdays. She bought small candles and paper serviettes. Alma, the

seamstress, had made a beautiful dress for me. Pink with a billowing skirt.
