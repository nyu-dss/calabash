What a divine world, | thought, and was filled with longings: a mother who lovingly
does the washing with a washboard in the kitchen, her plump white arms dripping suds.

The one time a disaster happened to Ot and Sien the chapter was called: 'A Leak at

Guurtje's'. It had been windy. A tile had got loose. There was a leak in the old woman's
house. That was something nasty happening in that other world. That was worth
mention.

Mrs Miskin taught me another language. She recited long, rhythmic sentences,
her head held to one side, looking into the distance: 'Similar sounds are stepping stones

past that she longed for it. It ruled her days. She didn't discuss it. In front of the class she
could only give a display of silence.

‘What are you thinking about?’ asked Mrs Miskin. ‘I'm tying to refine you and |

see you staring into space. Pay attention, girl, don't daydream.’ And she carried on with
