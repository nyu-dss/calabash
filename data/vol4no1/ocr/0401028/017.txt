After finishing the job she collapsed. Felled, she lay between the sheets with a
wet flannel over her eyes. The blinds in her bedroom had to be kept shut, in her state she
couldn't abide the light of day. But it was the moon, especially the moon, that had to be
shut out. She cursed the day she was born and called herself a hinny, a worthless
monster, a dry well. The ominous owls called, the dogs howled along with her, heads up
high, raised to the moon, sorrowing for unfulfilled desires.

‘And you,’ she moaned bitterly, 'I know that all my efforts to make you someone
in society are pearls before swine.’ She predicted that the day would come when I would
forget her.

‘Never, never,’ | spluttered from my kneeling position at the foot of her bed. 'I
shall always carry you with me.’

Normally, she was glad to have me with her. She said | was her hobby, a gift,

you civilization you would have lacked if you had stayed in the bush.’ | would have been
unable to read or write. | would have been a lost soul in the jungle, a prey to wild
animals. And without a grain of spiritual hygiene. She took her time and said what she

My second birthday on the twenty-second of February was celebrated, just as the first

A green exercise book appeared.

‘Don't look so crestfallen,’ Mrs Miskin took the exercise book out of my hands.
‘What do you think it is?’

'‘Anexercise book,’ I said.

‘That's what | thought. Eugenio, may | use your pen?’

Mr Miskin stood up and walked to the writing table in the corner of the room,
took a pen out of the pen holder and opened the ink bottle.

‘Wait, before an accident happens.’ Mrs Miskin walked over to him, sat at the

table, dipped the pen into the bottle and started writing on the cover.
