The monkeys weren't bothered by the fact that the yard was bewitched. As light
as birds they sprang from branch to branch. All at once a rifle shot rung out and | saw
one of the animals tumble down, hit the top of the fence and plop down in our yard like
an overripe fruit. [ ran over to it. The animal lay on its belly with its face in the sand. In
the tree the other monkeys shrieked. Some of the animals sprang down to the lowest
branches. | picked up a stick and turned the animal over onto its back. It was a squirrel
monkey. The eyes were wide open. The upper lip was drawn up and the little teeth were
visible in the silent, grinning mouth. In its arms it held on tight to a tiny, wrinkled, baby
monkey. The little one crumpled its tiny forehead into a frown. Its mouth opened and
closed with a suckling movement. I tried to lever the baby from its mother's embrace. But
the mother animal held on stiffly to the little black hands. It was as if a clamp had been
closed around her baby's body.

I ran into the house to get Mrs Miskin. When we came back out there was no
monkey on the ground, the animals had disappeared. High up in the mango tree the last
monkeys sprang away and dissolved in the shades of the trees on the haunted property.

‘Now listen good, girl. Don't play tricks on me.' She held onto my chin with one
hand and forced me to look her in the eyes. Threateningly, she held her index finger
under my nose: ‘Imagination and reality aren't the same thing, remember that. Reality is
gruesome enough by itself.’

I swore I was telling the truth. It was unbearable that Mrs Miskin suspected me
of lying.

I've noticed that you see a lot more than's good for you. Close your eyes. Don't go
getting yourself any hebies you're not strong enough for.

The shot that had brought down the monkey had come from the large property

that adjoined ours on the other side, a bigi jarie, on which various houses stood.

Mrs Miskin said: 'It was as if Noah's Ark ran aground there after the flood. That's
Surinam, she said and, about to start declaiming, assumed her solemn face, ‘in a nutshell.
Our country does not have just one people but different kinds with their own languages,
religions, customs and habits. There is no single tradition. They don't know where they
come from or where they are going to. Their only point of departure is their great

suffering and that undermines them.’
