During Mr and Mrs Miskin's meals in the dining room there was nothing to be
heard except the clicking of cutlery on china. At the table a great silence ruled between
my foster parents. The final chord, which | learned to recognize in the scraping of the
cutlery on the plate, a short silence and the sound of Mr Miskin's chair being pushed
