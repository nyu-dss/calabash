have to take as it is? You see people everywhere who don't accept the life they receive
and resist it, always trying to squirm their way out of it: megalomania, waste. Sooner or
later death has mercy on them.

I'm not mentioned in the records of Spite and Remorse. My existence starts in the
house of Mr and Mrs Miskin in Paramaribo. These are the people who raised me to be
who I amnow. | am named with their name and speak as they speak. What preceded this
fostered life now exists as vague images of the journey from the plantation to
Paramaribo. But there are also some clear flashes. Such as my climbing into the car, a
