All imaginable peoples were represented on the bigi jarie; Indians, Hindus, a

Maroon, a Chinese, Boeroes. If Noah had seen that motley crew he would have thought:
‘What now?’ And abandoned ship.

Mostly the people there just moped around. They were poor and the property
was dirty. With the slightest bit of rain it flooded. The latrines overflowed and gave offa
penetrating stench. Chickens, Pekin ducks, a pakira, a baby deer, dogs and cats; they were
all mixed up together.

In the middle of the property was the house of the Hindu family, Gopal. | was
forbidden to have any contact with them. From my bedroom window I had a good view
of their verandah. They were always fiddling with each other, combing hair or looking
for lice. The man had filariasis. He moved with his legs wide apart, as if walking on tree-
stump stilts. Below his knees his trouser legs looked like flared skirts. There were
eighteen children in the family. It wasn't very long after I'd seen the dead monkey in the
garden that three of the Gopals' children died in the space of a few days. The mother set
up a piercing wailing tore her hair out of her head. From my bedroom | watched her
throw herself on the ground and start eating sand. Disdainfully, Mrs Miskin commented
on the riffraff next door: ‘What a farce. With eighteen, three more or less is neither here
nor there. They're ghastly. Those women breed like rabbits. You have to ask yourself how
that fellow manages it. It's an ungodly state of affairs.’

She viewed the fact that she herself had never had any children as the worst thing
that had ever happened to her. When the moon was full she moaned: 'Oh, Father in
Heaven, that I've never been fun to bursting and able to endure that liberating pain.’

Every time she got her sickness, which is what she called those strange moods, it
was full moon. First she became uneasy and started talking incessantly. The whole house
was turned upside down. The linen was dragged out of the wardrobe, the china cabinet
had to be washed out, the copper polished, the mosquito nets aired.

‘Tcan't stand this filth, I can't stand it,’ she mumbled. The house had to be cleaned
from top to bottom. She sprinkled lavish quantities of Creoline which dissolved in water
to form a milky fluid. On my knees, | scrubbed the floorboards clean. To her | was a
slattern, a grub. She called me unteachable. | could do nothing right.
