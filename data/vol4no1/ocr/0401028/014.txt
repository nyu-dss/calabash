‘But it's so darned long ago. I bet that even in the mother country a search for his poems
would be in vain.’

It was the neighbourhood where many streets were named after Dutch governors:
Wichers Street, Crommelin Street, Van Sommelsdijck Street. My school was on Loth
Avenue.

The house, the largest in the street, was built on stilts. Around the yard a
concrete wall had been erected. Shards of glass from broken bottles had been set into the
top of the wall.

On one side the yard bordered on a large property on which an abandoned,
bougainvillea and ivy-covered, planter's house stood. Mango trees, cacao, pomegranates,
soursop grew in abundance in that garden. Once when I was busy sweeping the front
yard, a lot of mangos fell one after the other to the ground. | looked up and saw that the
crown of the giant mango tree, that top-heavily overshadowed part of our yard, was
coloured with moving black and yellow. I stopped working. Amongst the plentiful fruit |
picked out little monkeys. The animals were gorging themselves on the fruit no one
picked.

The property was bewitched. Everyone in the neighbourhood knew that.

In the night time you heard baleful owl's calls.

At the most unexpected moments you would see a big cane basket on the broken
wooden bridge that connected the property with the street. The basket was filled to
overflowing with the most beautiful fruit, bottles of wine and spirits. On top of the wine
and snacks sat a living white chicken, put there by the same invisible hand. The animal
made no attempt to escape.

With a shiver | passed the objects. In the early afternoon when | came back from
school everything was untouched under the scorching sun and the chicken was gasping
for air. The next morning there was no sign of the basket. When I first saw the basket on
my way to school, I went back to the house to get Mrs Miskin.

In the future you must act as if the object is not there. Because what the eye
doesn't see can do the heart no harm.’ She spat on the ground, made the sign of the cross,
and instructed me to do the same. That day I was late for school. Sister Victorine had no
sympathy for my excuse. As punishment I had to write ‘Witchcraft does not exist’ one

hundred times.
