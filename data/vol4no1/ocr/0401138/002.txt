Beats

Far away

She say write book fuh yaself

And speak ya tongue

‘Cause she say the water bucket dem is hard burden on she back still
When she carry it down the village

To cook rice and watch the water boil

For four

When they have seven

Sellin’ fruit at Stabroek hard

When the whole village kiss the soil done

And she say it hard to sew

Sweat does mess up the seam at two in the mornin
So she close the shutter window

When pickney sleepin’

And she listen to the quiet like choir

And all she want is to open up Milton

And tell him the Paradise really, truly aint Lost
