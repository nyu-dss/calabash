TEACHER GIRL

Teacher girl, pretty man all the’ il pickney say
When she walk through the yard

With she white blouse and she press black skirt
She gat one voice like sugar, ya know

And hand like brick

Cause when she clap you, yeah you,

‘Cause ya mouth too hot and ya brain too dull
Watch out, boy

Stick leg boy

Tuck in ya shirt

And if you ain’ t gat shoe

Grease up the leg with coc’ nut oil quick quick
quick

Yeah, boy, she fine hand does sting

Like bee, wasp

Hummingbird tongue

Daddy who quiet today

And like he cliché

When he belly good and full

Say ya never judge one

Book by the cover

That's what daddy say

He say open the damn book, ya hear

And teacher gyurl

With the brown skin that God must be kiss
And the black hair

And the Indian eye

She say open the book too

“Cause she know what book dem have

Alla Milton and all a dem
