blue screams

dreams of tidal blue
washing over me
leaving me only the echo of
your name

economy of letters

ripe

bursting with meaning
indygo child

a deeper shade of blue
a deeper shade of blues

now there is Mama

my mother, your mother's mother
who has had to give me

up twice

her only woman/child

the moody girl with old eyes

who prefers the memories of love
who knows about the presence of love
and the presence of spirit

the sullen one whose love

is unconditional,

unyielding

a relentless thing

whose cycle is a circle not understood
by passersby

and when we two remain
within the cycle that is
our circle that is

our line of mothers

i will let you go again

as it has always been

and you must let me go
as it must be

and i will teach you that
the presence of the love is stronger than
the absence of my body
it is our bond

that is a cycle

a circle not undrstood

by passersby
