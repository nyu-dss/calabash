MOTHERLINES
OR BREAST FEEDING THE DIASPORA

the presence of love is greater than the

absence of the body

i believe

the mothers i have known

in fragile memories

have known love

have known loss

have known me and now you
this bond is a cycle

a circle not understood

by passersby

first there is Mom

mother of my mother's mother
who outlived one daughter's life
and another's sanity

she too comes from

mothers who have had to

cut their children loose

give them up to the care

of un-natural mothers

and though there was outer distance
there is always the inner line

so inamed you blue
the deepest blue
my deepest blues
