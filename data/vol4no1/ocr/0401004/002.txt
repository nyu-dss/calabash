and like you
i knew my mother's mother first

Oma

icalled her

my grand mother

tall imposing

wise eyes

taht reached deep

and expected much

i learned lessons

i did not know i was being taught
that manners was not meekness
that there was strength ina smile
that there was healing in the tears of women
and in the laughter of our men

she died when i was four

at her funeral they passed me

over her open grave

according to the old ways

it meant that i was the favored one

my first memories of my mother
were born

on that day

in my deepest blues

i wonder

will you know of the mothers
in our line that

gave theri children

to other mothers?

women who know about the presence of love
over the absence of the body

or will you be
the sullen girl
1 was

hardly smiling
not unhappy
just blue

deep blue

like indygo

blue water
blue movement
blue tears
