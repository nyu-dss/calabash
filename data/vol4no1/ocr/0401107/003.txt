early teens, witnessed some passionate discussions about the situation of Haitian art and its
development among many fiery and talented young painters such as Bernard Wah, one of the

founders of Calfou. Marithou may have been too young to understand and appreciate the
extent of the debates about formalism in art, but those discussions would later influenced her
when she eventually chose to follow a path that would take her from the predominance of
objectivity to that of subjectivity, from formal exercises to the expression of her inner self.

Her first painting was done in oil on paper, using her sister's leftover materials, during
the mid-nineteen sixties, just before her sister left to study in Paris, just before Calfou closed
for political reasons and before many of its artists left the country willingly or by being forced
into exile. In 1969 she married Roland Dupoux, a man involved in radio communication. As
her wifely responsibilities became less overwhelming, Marithou's interest in her artistic career
manifested itself. At the time there were no art schools and very few choices were offered for
training so Marithou worked on her own, sketching anything that caught her eye. Since the
Indigenist movement of the nineteen thirties* and the opening of Foyer des Arts Plastiques” a
few years later, there existed no manifestos or documents about art and its meaning for
Haitian culture. This was also the time of the Duvalier government, which regarded any
gathering of artists and intellectuals as dangerous. Thus, Haitian painters began to work
isolated from one another and the growth of art could no longer be seen in terms of movement
but rather in terms of individual style. Marithou was thus exposed to a multitude of
individual artists, the variety of which created a certain stylistic inconsistency evident in the
first years of her career.

Marithou's first role model was Lois Mailou Jones, a most renowned African-American
painter trained in the US and in Paris in the nineteen twenties and thirties. In nineteen
fifty-three, she married Verniaud Pierre-Noél, a Haitian graphic artist, a distant relative of the
Latortue family. Ms. Jones had since gone to Haiti every year, for lengthy visits during which
she painted and also held workshops. She made enormous contributions to the promotion of
women artists in Haiti and arranged for their works to be exhibited in various American
universities. In doing so, she was instrumental in building women’s confidence in a society
where, not so long before, “serious art” was considered a domain reserved exclusively to men.
Among the advice she unsparingly gave her colleagues, the most important may have been
their need for proper training, constant practice, and the devotion and discipline they had to

bring to their careers.
