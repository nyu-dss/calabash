In La Grenadine An underlying drawing is meticulously executed. The various elements,
mostly household objects and flowers, are well proportioned and arranged as to suggest the
third dimension. Light is given the essential function of creating the illusion of mass and the
various elements are perfectly rendered in their solidity, in the defined space. The effects of
light on the copper vase and on the glass are prodigious. Unfortunately, the folds in the
tablecloth seem unnecessary and appear to have been added just to demonstrate some kind of
virtuosity. Although, at the time, she was not really interested in selling her paintings, she
wanted them to be pleasant, free from any literary association and more in compliance with
the indigenist idea of representing items that are typically Haitian. This is why, to her locally
grown flowers, she added a couple of eucalyptus branches, commonly found in Haitian homes
as a mean of chasing away mosquitoes. Further, as the title of the work indicates, we are not
presented with a glass of red wine but with a water-based drink whose sweet taste can be
overcome by the juice of limes placed on the plate near the glass.

In the same year that La Grenadine was produced Marithou began working with
Jean-Pierre Théard, a young follower of Achille Scordilis, a Greek painter who lived in Haiti in
and around nineteen 1973-1974. Scordilis was a trained artist who insisted on precision,
details, academic notions of colour and the illusion of space through aerial perspective. After
Scordilis' departure from Haiti, the young artists who worked under his guidance went on
two separate paths: one that led to the so-called Neo-Primitives, very popular on the
international market, the other to a trend that a local critic coined the “School of Beauty”, very
popular with a growing local clientele. Jean Pierre Théard had chosen the latter.

Although Marithou's contact with the ‘School of Beauty’ was through Jean-Pierre
Théard, she showed a strong influence of Bernard Séjourné's style in her Danse (The Dance)
also produced in nineteen eighty two. In this painting one can sense the delicate harmonies of
colours, a rigorous attention paid to the underlying drawing. Curved lines dominate the
composition and there is the presence of a circle’, to the right of the painting in which the

body of the female dancer is bent to fit. More in line with the atmosphere of Jean-Pierre
Theard's work is Marithou's La Ronde (Children's Dance) of 1982 where, detached from a plain

background, three girls, with typical Haitian features, are shown dancing in a circle so happily

that their bodies become airy, in defiance of gravity.
