One can hardly speak of school, movement or even partnership when talking about the
art of the key figures of the “School of Beauty”: Bernard Séjourné, Jean-René Jéréme and
Amilcar Simil were individuals who shared a similar experience of having gone through the
Haitian Academy of Fine Arts.° Although they worked independently from one another, they
shared the same aesthetic concerns and raised the same questions to which, however, they
each found individual answers. Their art, dealing generally with images of women, is
characterized essentially by technical perfection, poetic forms and beautiful harmonies; thus
the label the “School of Beauty.” However, such were qualities already sought after by artists
of “Calfou” and by Bernard Wah in particular, therefore, it’s no surprise that they were carried
on by Bernard Séjourné who had been a young but active member of that group.

Marithou exhibited for the first time among a group of artists associated with the
so-called School of Beauty. She was less concerned with sales than with the public reaction to
her art. As a matter of fact, the opinion of Roland Dorcely, who attended the opening, was
determinative. Dorcely was a most celebrated Haitian artist and one of the founders of the
Foyer des Arts Plastiques. He later spent several years in Paris and traveled extensively
throughout Europe where he often exhibited. He also exhibited in the United States and
eventually The Museum of Modem Art in New York acquired one of his paintings. When
Dorcely returned permanently to Haiti in 1965, he became a recluse and his presence at the
gallery that evening of the opening was a surprise to most, to Marithou most of all. He then
invited her to join a very small group of students he had working with him.

Despite her admiration for the master, there is little or no trace of Dorcely's direct
influence in Marithou's work. This is because at the time Marithou joined his workshop he
was involved in a most unusual project creating a museum for young Haitians to learn to
appreciate the works of great masters of European art. The particularity of this project was
that all the works were copies made by Dorcely himself and copying the works of great
masters was part of Dorcely’s teaching method. In doing so, Marithou came in contact with a
domain that she was unfamiliar with: art history with its variety of period and personal styles,
which opened up her art to newer forms. Marithou's assignment in Dorcely's classes was to
copy a portrait of the Infanta of Spain by Velasquez. She finished one version in pastel crayons
but Dorely insisted that she worked with oil paints simply because, as he said, it allows time
to think. The oil version however remained unfinished because the size of the canvas required

the use of a ladder and also because she became pregnant and unable to work with oil paint
