There was landscape painted by Lois Mailou Jones in the house where Marithou grew
up. It was her favourite. In the summer of nineteen seventy-six, during a visit to update
research on contemporary art in Haiti, Ms Jones met Marithou and that was a thrilling
moment for the young artist; soon after, she began visiting Ms. Jones in her Port-au-Prince
studio. Marithou admired Jones’ technique, the straightforward and naturalistic approach of
her subjects. Jones’ landscapes were said to be impressionistic because her instructors at the
Academie Julian, in Paris, had given her a taste for “plein-air” paintings in which she could
capture first impressions of nature. Jones’ colours had the intensity that the Impressionists
were known for, yet her brushstrokes were much less visible. Furthermore she paid careful
attention to structure and to the clarity of form.

Marithou later incorporated many of Jones’ qualities in her own work; she adopted her
fluid application of bright colours and gradually developed an interest in figure painting.
Marithou was not interested at first in conventional portraits. Her representation of people
was more generic but she borrowed Ms. Jones freer style and worked from photographs taken
by her husband Roland. The figure itself was then defined by strong contours, and fluid
transparent colours were applied independently of these contours. Thus Marithou’s sketched
figures appeared against, yet enclosed in, an abstractly painted surface. Such paintings were
essentially decorative and very much in tune with the new taste that favoured an art easy to
read and free of the harshness of social themes put forth by the Foyer des Arts Plastiques.

Marithou then turned toa more classical art and began a series of still-life studies. The
still-life was not only a good learning tool, but also a means of finding order in the chaos that
she was sensing on the artistic scene. Her approach thus became very “academic” and she paid
particular attention to formal elements such as linear structure and composition. In nineteen
eighty, Marithou approached Nehemy Jean, a notorious Haitian painter, for advice. He had
studied at the Art Student League of New York and at Columbia University and had gone
through various stylistic changes. By the time Marithou sought his guidance he had
completely discarded his previous concern for light, volume and space and thus, encouraged
Marithou to stick to simple harmonies of pastel tones. Marithou’s paintings then took on a

golden yellow overtone to which a few elements of soft red, green and blue are added, as seen

in La Grenadine, painted in nineteen eighty two.
