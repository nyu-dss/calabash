inevitably to abstraction so that her L'Air Rouge (the Red Atmosphere) a landscape of 1996
incorporated abstract forms.

Landscapes are very rare in Marithou's oeuvre. She is not an outdoor person although
she does enjoy gardening because she likes to be active. Considering this painting as an
“improvised” landscape we must realise that no spatial depth in the visual sense of the word,
no illusion of space, which indicates that the artist was concerned with keeping the whole
picture in relation with the flat surface of the canvas. Yet there is, in some of the simple basic
forms, a clear sense of solidity and structure for they appear to be seen from above, from the
side and also face front. This means that the viewer must deal a notion of space much like the
one explored by the Cubists. Their ochre and white colours, contrasting with the red
background, further participate in creating this different space. There is no rigid order in the
way the forms, mostly geometric, are placed on the canvas. The way that there are placed
seem to create a certain inner tensions conveying a feeling of non-naturalistic energies. Five
elements bring rhythm to the surface while enforcing the verticality of the composition. These
elements, which are not immediately identifiable, carry the only more or less referential images
of very small green leaves. This could lead the viewer to believe that these vertical shapes
would be that of lianas. Such an assumption would in turn suggest that they are images of
degrading vegetation placed against a chaotic arrangement of cubicles and other odd shapes,
bathing in a red coloured atmosphere.

Undoubtedly, such an image, although avoiding strict representational means, does
more than suggest a mood defined by the dominance of red, a colour that, associated with the
sky, is seen as an ill omen. The painting, therefore, most certainly says that can be revealed by
considering the artist’s own environment, the community she lives in. The industrial age was
essentially responsible for the migration into urban areas, and social issues it brought about
have had a serious impact on realism in French art of the late nineteenth century. In the early
twentieth century, American artists developed a kind of “democratic art” that moved away
from contemporary academism to better deal with issues linked with the life of people living
in large cities. Migration toward urban centres began in Haiti in the nineteen sixties and
reached its peak during the years of the embargo (1991-1994). The two most visible and most
devastating impacts of that migration were the inconsiderate destruction of trees to be turned

into cooking fuel and the uncontrollable development of shantytowns. Marithou and her

husband had built their home in a remote area, a few miles outside of Petionville” The road
