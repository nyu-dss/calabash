where the various elements were arranged as to respect a strict pictorial order. It is still
painterly, has a more calculated composition and is much less spontaneous, less vigorous.

Life throughout the country was so slow that people had little to do besides
accomplishing their essential daily chores. Marithou thus had ample time to organize daily
sessions with Madame Turnier. Marithou had then reached a point where she had come close

to doing “trompe I'ceil” paintings. Her still-lives took on the nobility that is customarily given

to portraits, as in Le Violon. (The Violin) of 1991. In this still life however, she seems to go
beyond the mere representation of the objects themselves to capture the sensitivity and the
intelligence of the viewer. In spite of the fact that this painting had enormous appeal,
Marithou felt unsatisfied because she felt that it failed to reflect her own personality. Having
matured as a woman, and moving closer to maturity as an artist, Marithou needed to develop a
more specific visual language through which would express her own feelings.

As the friendship grew stronger and stronger between the two women, Luce Turnier
and Marithou began working together on the same live models. Stylistically, her paintings
were very close to that of Madame Turnier, yet, unlike Madame Turnier who was more
concerned with attitudes to express her model's personality, Marithou insisted on both
physical and psychological resemblance. The complicity and the friendship that developed
between came to an unfortunate end when Turnier departed to France due to illness and died
shortly thereafter. It was then, in a tribute to her deceased friend and tutor that Marithou
showed her most extraordinary portrait of Luce Turnier.®

No longer able to rely on Madame Turnier for support or encouragement, and unable to
work by herself in her studio, in nineteen ninety three Marithou joined a group of students at a
class given by Jean Claude Garoute, better known as Tiga. Tiga is a major figure of modernism
in Haitian art. His training as an artist was very much like that of Marithou, in the sense that
he never went to a formal art school and relied on the advice of older artists for instructions.
One of those older artists was Lucien Price, an important figure of Haiti's avant-garde art
circle. Although Price never ceased to stress the importance of drawing techniques, he was the
first abstract artist in Haiti and in all of the Caribbean and his works, mainly on paper, always

relied on the precision of his drawings.
Marithou's paintings of that time then close to abstractions and her Accouplement

(Coupling) of 1993 illustrates how her style changed through her contact with Tiga. Ata
