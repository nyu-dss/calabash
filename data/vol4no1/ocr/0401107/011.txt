leading to that house passed through what was literally a forest. Day after day, months after
months, year after year, she could see trees being cut down to make room for an ever
increasing number of seedy houses of cement blocs left unpainted. The dazzling population
growth in the cities and its effect on the environment was, in Haiti as well, influential in the
arts. L'Air Rouge as well and works by contemporary artists like Carlo Jean-Jacques and
Michéle Manuel are testimony to this historical change.

During her brief abstract period Marithou worked mostly with three colours: red,
black and white. In theses paintings, areas painted in black are not shadows of forms; they are
distinct entities as are the fields of red. In these compositions of rather small format, the areas
of colours are well defined and are highlighted by traces of white, restrained gestures that
activate the surface. Further, the interrelations between the three colours are orderly, meaning
that, although apparently spontaneous, these small paintings may have developed from
preliminary sketches. Ultimately, Marithou would also depart from abstraction in her work.
When asked why she abandoned abstraction Marithou's answered: “The milieu is too narrow
minded. People see abstraction as an easy way out of formal training, as a way to compensate
for a lack of draftsmanship, or even worse as something that is purely decorative.”””

During the two years Marithou worked with Tiga, she shared his interest African
aesthetics. The African mask, the most common at form, had been incorporated in the formal
and symbolic language of Haitian artists since the mid-nineteen forties following the visit in
Haiti of Cuban artists like Wifredo Lam and Carlos Henriquez.” Contemporary Haitians
artists like Lucien Price and Roland Dorcely among others could then begin to relate to
African art on the basis of race, but also from the point of view of its importance in the
development of modern art. The relation of African art and modernism of course led Marithou
to the work of Picasso, and so appeared in her works female figures whose facial features are
seen simultaneously from different points of view next to precise renderings of African masks.
Marithou’s rendition of the beauty of motherhood comes then to be associated with the
intrinsic beauty of the mask, seen as a work of art. This method of stressing the expressive
strength of the work matched well the images of “mother and child” with which she was
working. At this stage, in Marithou's art, subjectivity was definitely taking the lead over
objectivity.

The colour red was so important and so meaningful that we could refer to the time

span from nineteen ninety six to nineteen ninety-eight as Marithou’s “red period” when the
