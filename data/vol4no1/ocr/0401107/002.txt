sex and history. There was also Hilda Williams who kept a distance from fashions and
ideologies, and never took on social issues, or the purely formal research with which her
contemporaries were concerned.

In 1948, Marithou was born Marie-Thérése Latortue, in Port-au-Prince. She grew up in
an environment where art was thought to be “one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent
perspiration.” Her father was a professional guitarist and a music teacher who held classes on
the porch of the family house. He demanded discipline, assiduity and hard work from his
pupils and from his children, he demanded much more. Her aunt was an art teacher who
defended that fact that talent was essential but not sufficient for someone to take on an
artistic career. Marithou's older sister, who incidentally was her godmother, developed an
interest in the visual arts as part of a generation of girls who were offered art classes at school,
along with embroidery, home economics and other skills required for a young woman to
become a good housewife and mother. These art classes consisted mainly of copying images
from imported art books and reproductions, a practice disliked by Haitian artists of the
nineteen fifties and sixties when issues of what constituted Haitian identity was still strongly
debated. Within that context, landscapes with snow capped mountains and still-lives with
fruits, such as apples and pears, foreign to tropical climates were said to encourage “a taste
from slavish imitations.” When Marithou's older sister began painting in the late nineteen
fifties, she made it a point to hang around artists whose focus was on ‘authenticity’ while
insisting strongly on formal qualities.

In Haitian art history of the late nineteen forties and early fifties, technical know-how
never had much importance. Furthermore, there was enormous publicity given to “primitive”
or “naive” artists who had brought world attention to Haiti, which was considered as “the
only country in the world whose entire artistic output was represented by works of naive
painters, primitive, not only in their approach, but also in their complete lack of academic
training.” When Haitian artists began to insist on talent as well as formal training, it was a
way to re-position Haitian art as more than just “primitive” or art of the untrained. This was
particularly so at “Calfou,”’ which was in the nineteen sixties, the forum of “modern” art. In
this turn of the century house, one could encounter and talk about art with people involved in
various disciplines such as painting, poetry, music and theatre.

While Marithou was much too young to hang out in “Calfou” her older sister did and

often, these conversations were carried on over at the Latortue's house. Marithou, then in her
