young age, Tiga traveled throughout the inner country and came in close contact with popular
culture. In the early nineteen sixties, at the time precisely when his contemporaries were
seeking originality in what he called a 'modern language borrowed from elsewhere,’ Tiga
suggested other cultural and technical references drawn from within the popular culture.
Together with Patrick Vilaire, a now renowned sculptor, Tiga created 'Poto-Mitan"’ a name
chosen obviously to indicate that the true values of Haitian art had to come from popular
culture. Years later, having retired to the mountains above Port-au-Prince, Tiga initiated a
most interesting experiment with local peasants; an experiment referred to as “St. Soleil”.
Evaluating its results Tiga was convinced that the true meaning of art had to be found outside
art schools and academies and therefore could be “accessible to anyone who cared to look

deeper into his roots.

Throughout his career, Tiga had experienced several techniques, and
at the time Marithou joined his classes, he was teaching the use of sponges instead of
traditional brushes. While offering the possibility of creating patterns, this technique only

allowed approximate forms.

By nineteen ninety-five, Marithou began working alone. Her figures, like her Nu (Nude)
of 1995 are well-defined by lines of contours, yet they tend to blend almost entirely with
various surrounding forms and motifs covering the entire surface. That period is marked by
Marithou's often-successful attempts to reconcile formal and spontaneous elements. Indeed,
one finds, on the one hand, straight lines, designed shapes, levelled colours, and on the other,
soft lines, obscured forms and sets of abstract motifs incised in the paint. The use of the
sponge had further forced her to reconsider the notion of space and deal more with surface.
Her works, liberated from oppressively academic concerns, appeared to be conscious and
unconscious at the same time while being neither one nor the other. Along with the sense of
freedom came a different way of seeing the world. The expression of her phantasms became
unhindered.

While evolving stylistically, Marithou discovered the expressive force of colours.
Although she had never shown any interest for the Haitian “primitive” or “naive” painters, she
always had a bent for their often audacious use of colour and the time had come when she felt

comfortable with the idea of painting a woman's body red like in her Femme Oiseau (Woman

Bird) of 1995. Her interest in colour, the joy she had in playing with them had to lead her
