dominant red colour in L'Air Rouge is associated with an ill omen. Red takes on a very different

meaning in this Accouplment of 1998 and is associated with passion and creating an atmosphere
that brings us back further into the realm of figure painting, filled with familiar shapes. The
work is dominated by the outlines of two bodies, one of a man, one of a woman, embracing in a
posture that could have been taken from the kama sutra or any other source of erotic images.
The well-proportioned bodies and body parts are in the midst of decorative forms: fishes and
leaves and against a black field, toward the left, white lines criss-cross as to suggest a fish net.
Three vignettes containing calligraphic designs are placed at random on the surface. Referring
to the symbolic meaning of the fish, the viewer deducts that its presence can be seen as
reinforcing the idea of coupling, for fish is the symbol of fruitfulness and life as suggested here.
The interpretation of this painting is not really the point here. It is just meant to illustrate the
fact that she needed figures in order for her preoccupations and inner feelings to sound forth
more clearly. More and more she was going to return to the figure and to the draftsmanship
she had acquired over the years.

In the year two thousand, her figures moved from flat forms to more modeled bodies.
In her Age of Aquarius of that year, the mass of the angel’s body, central to the composition, is
treated with precision contrasting with the flatness of the abstract surrounding motifs. Its
shapeliness is well rendered. She even created a see-through rectangle to allow the subject's
musculature to be seen. The foreshortening is also well rendered. The ample white pants are

dealt with in a fashion that recalls the cloths in her earlier Nature Morte aux Verres. The stool

the model is sitting on is barely visible yet, one cannot avoid seeing the blue fish suspended by
a thread to the subject's little finger. It may then be a phallus symbol inscribed into the
innocent picture of an angel who, according to century old legends, has no sexual identity.

Of the same period, in identical style, is Mak Bleu, the sculptured torso of a man, once
again placed in generally abstract surroundings showing however, here and there, some
human silhouettes and a man’s head separated from the torso. A fragment of an antique statue
undeniably was her source of inspiration. While it shows physical strength, the figure's
swaying posture provides it with a sense of elegance. The notion of beauty referred to here is
no longer African but that established by antique Greek standards. Inspired by the antique
idea of beauty, the sexual organs of the figure had to play little or no role in the representation.

Respecting this iconographic tradition, Marithou has discretely, elegantly even, omitted the
