and organic solvents. The experience, however short, was profitable since Marithou developed
an interest in highly formal painting and learned to master the effects of light and shadows.
Most importantly the experience moved away from the influence of the School of Beauty.

After a period during which her occupation as a young mother took most of her time,
Marithou felt the need return to her passion and looked to work with someone just as
passionate. Luce Turnier then was the perfect mentor. At that time, Haiti was placed under
an embargo, following a military coup. Madame Turnier had a strong personality and was very
demanding as an instructor. Luce was considered the 'Grande dame" of Haitian art and was
often jealous of other painters’ success. At first Madame Turnier regarded Marithou as a
threat and undermined her abilities; for daily assignments, Madame Turnier would literally
throw odd objects on a table and yell at Maritous with authority: ‘paint that!" Marithou used
this challenge to surpass herself and began to differentiate between imitations of objects and
interpretations of visual sensations.

It is interesting to consider one of Marithou’s pieces produced during this time, like

her Nature Morte aux Verres (Still-life with glasses) of 1992, in comparison with the

aforementioned, La Grenadine. In Nature there is a definite change in her approach of the genre.
The work is definitely bolder. Marithou's mastery turned this commonplace subject into a
true painting with a strong emphasis on the painterly. Every part of the surface is equally
worked with thick brushstrokes and that gives unity as well as a rich consistency to the work.
The directions of her energetic applications of paint define the folds in the cloth on the table
and the one over the back of the chair, which creates a lack of precision and some distortions
that in no way affect the overall quality of the work. The focal point of the artist’s
observation being the two glasses, she has given them form and solidity through their
transparency and through the reflective properties of the water contained in the one on the
left. Because Luce Turnier had placed the objects at random, their position in relation to one
another does not allow for one of the traditional means of suggesting space (one object hiding
part of another). Besides, the illusion of space is not of primary concern here, Marithou is
more interested in dealing with pictorial space and does so by creating an interesting relation
between the “near” and the “far” that is basically the relation between the real world (three

dimensions) and the illusory world (two dimensions) of the support. It is also interesting to

compare this same painting with Le Pot de Confiture (The Jam pot) of that same period and
