male organs. Drawn from the past, it appears as a dream, a vision indicating the fruitfulness of

Marithou’s art.

More examples of her more recent work include Danse de Paitin (The dancing puppet)
of 2000, which illustrated well the dominant idea of a series she created. It shows her
intellectual and technical maturity. And yet there is another painting titled Le Réve (The
Dream) of 2000 based on a boxwood mannequin that she purchased for study because the
mannequin can take a variety of postures and may be looked at from different points of view.
For Marithou, then, the boxwood mannequin is a means of using posture to express different
situations. The object, or in this case the subject, is meticulously rendered. Its mass is shown
against a flat background made of tile-like elements, some of which contain images that could
well be that of the subject or sequences of his dreams. Traditionally, the dreamer is someone of
whom no effective action can be expected. Yet, dreams, since Freud, have taken on an
unprecedented importance. It has become the process by which we are awakened to another
world, a world where we are truly ourselves.

Haiti is not a place with an uninterrupted tradition of great art. It isa place where few
infrastructures were ever put in place for the development of the arts. There is therefore much
to be said about artists who, like Marithou, have struggled against all odds. Her sensibility as
an artist emerged at a time when formal concern dominated and it evolved toward maturity in
the midst of total confusion and uncertainty. As a mature woman, she was affected by
changes in the world around her and refused to remain emotionally neutral, seeking after
visual means to express herself, borrowing from whatever source was available. Her art has
become centered on issues like the falling of heroes, the questioning of masculinity in the
debate on gender roles, the developing fear in a less and less secure environment. If the
evolution of her career as an artist is not particularly original it is however the perfect
illustration of an artist’s relation to her art, to her environment (physical and human). It is also

indicative of the relation of community with the arts produced within it.
