SMALL BODIGOS

If only I could tear and hawk
just one of my poems

in verses

and clean their blood

in recently distilled milk;

to make small bodigos

with them

covered in flour.

If only I could

macerate one my verses

in letters

and condense them in the pulp
of an already dry breast,

and from it, offer libations

of the blasphemous
dissident germ

of salvation

of divine unconformity.

If only one stanza
unmade in words

and the interwoven gray hair
of my guilts

could harbor

those who sleep dispossessed
under the stairways.

How many words

to name

the misfortune;
so many names
