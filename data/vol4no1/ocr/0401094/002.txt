for misery
and only be able to name it.

If only I could tear and hawk
in verses

just one of my poems,

and cover so many bones

with flesh...

If only God allowed me to do it;
although no more than two...
who knows if maybe three...

The use of the word bodigo was taken from the Spanish medieval novel El Lazarillo de Tormes. It refers to the
medieval way of making the Host, which unlike in contemporary times, it was simply a small bun of bread,

which the priest sliced as he gave it to the filigrees. It could have been translated into “holy bread”, but the
simplicity of the bun of bread would have been lost.
