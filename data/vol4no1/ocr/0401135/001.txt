REVERENCE

Were it written at your birth
Jacqueline, Jean, Mona, Sessenne
or any appellation besides,

we would have, eventually,
dubbed you, “Winnie.”

But your godmother met you first-
my grandmother called her a seer-
and she, seeing, robbed us

of that game of words, bestowing
at the baptismal font

of a Roman Catholic church

the name you later earned

on harsh playgrounds of our youth.

Winnie, they must lengthen

their thesaurus, revise posthumous
dictionaries to include

the vibrating verb of you

who, giving, gave all your love outright.

Winnie, they must amend
their tome of sacred texts

for Lord knows there’ s a mass
of black saints missing.
