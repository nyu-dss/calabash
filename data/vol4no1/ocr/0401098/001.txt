EXOTIC BEACHES/EROTIC BODIES:
A REVIEW OF OONYA KEMPADOO'S
TIDE RUNNING

West Indian literature resonates with the presence of influential female
characters, who in many cases are vital to the movement and climax of a narrative, even if
they are not main characters. As Caribbean female writers continue to emerge and gain
prominence in Caribbean fiction they tackle issues such as class, gender and sexuality
with resounding success. Writers like Jamaica Kincaid Simone Shwarz-Bart and Patricia
Powell, to name just a few, draw critical attention to women and their personal lives in

various social, psychological and sexual contexts.

One recent voice in the chorus of female writers that focus on the presence and

meaning of the Caribbean woman is Oonya Kempadoo. Kempadooâ€™s novel, Tide Running,
weaves a complicated path between sexuality, the ethnic other and _ self-imposed
imperialism in what is a sometimes sexually graphic novel where power and desire
collide in a quiet Caribbean island buffeted by the tides of global consumerism. Born in

Britain and raised in Guyana, Kempadoo is a Guyanese native who was and her first

novel, Buxton Spice also focused on, among other things, the sexual development of young

girls growing up in Guyana. Tide Running, set entirely in Tobago, the small sister island to
Trinidad, serves up a very different kind of sexuality that focuses on three adults locked

in a complicated relationship that sees race, gender and sexuality helping to define each

character.
