Bella the Caribbean seems to exist in a glass house where “you can see all through” (51)
to observe and capture the essence of what goes on inside the region. Thus it seems, that
Bella is not the only photographer in the text after all, the novel invites the reader to see
the Caribbean in a certain kind of way as we share the gaze of each character in the text.
Tide Running succeeds as a critical text and a popular one; a fine balance for a
relatively new novelist to make. Amidst a control of the variations in West Indian
English, some quite hilarious scenes, and many juicy sensual descriptions, Kempadoo
offers a complex analysis of sexuality in the Caribbean. In a region where the stereotype
is sometimes one of a hyper-sexualized culture that erupts from repressive social and
economic structures, the text allows its readers to be both insiders and outsiders to

beautiful and erotic lives in a beautiful and exotic space.
