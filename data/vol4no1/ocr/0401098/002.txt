The protagonist and alternating narrative voices in the text are Bella and Cliff.
Bella is a Trinidadian woman of unclear racial status, perhaps East Indian mixed with
black or white mixed with black, who is married to a white British man named
Peter. Cliff is a dark skinned Afro-Tobagonian who is in love with the beauty of his
island’s ocean--a metaphor for chaos and danger, despite its evocative beauty. Indeed, the
three major characters seem to derive their essences from the sea as a chaotic force from
which spring life beauty and connections to other worlds. Peter is the steadfast
corporate lawyer, whose name in Christian theology means “rock”, and who like his
Biblical namesake, goes forth to become a fisher of men when he actively encourages Cliff
to have an affair with his wife. Bella, like her name is a beautiful woman who trains her
gaze through a photographic lens to capture the natural beauty that she experiences in a
romanticized fetishism of Tobago. Cliff is poor and un-employed, revealing his name as
indicative of a personality that teeters on the brink of Caribbean social life.

The complicated alliances that begin among the three characters takes on
multiple levels of meaning when both Cliff and Peter make Bella the object of their
sexual affections, a process in which lies the promise of redemption from a colonial past
(Peter) and the embodiment of American-style material success (Cliff). Eventually, Cliff
compromises his moral integrity when he begins to steal from Bella and Peter. The real
theft however, is the loss of the simple soul of the Caribbean as it is pulled from one
imperial paradigm to another, between Europe and America, while it tries to make
something culturally compelling and sustainable out of the beauty of its people and
surroundings. Thus, the double narrator motif leads readers to understand the
competing voices of the Caribbean that seek to be heard, understood and accepted as
legitimate articulations of the issues facing the region.

An understanding of the characters inevitably leads the reader back to the author,
the details of whose life comports with some facets of the novel. Kempadoo herself is
often described physically in uncertain racial terms; she is British-born, married to a
white British man, but is now a Caribbean resident; she also was, before becoming a
writer, involved in the visual arts. As such Kempadoo herself, much like her characters, is
a reflection of the topos of the Caribbean as a Creole space that constantly struggles with
issues of limited class mobility, poverty, sexual liberation and the barrage of Euro-

American culture that constantly assaults and co-opts the West Indian psyche. Like
