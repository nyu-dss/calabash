managed to acquire. I believe that even the idea of a character being appropriately attired
for an occasion, can function as “light” in a poem or a story. I am particularly fond of that
letter of John Keats’ where he talks about putting on a clean shirt and tightly lacing up
his shoes whenever he felt as if he was in danger of being overcome by despair. I guess
these things have replaced or extended my light versus dark repertoire.

MICHELA: The memory of the Middle Passage, of the uprooting and
dispossession of a whole people, is at the core of your narrative, often seen through the
eyes of a young girl: How should such memory be treated by both writer and reader; and
how should one bear this memory in everyday life?

GOODISON: The memory of the middle passage and the uprooting and
dispossession of a whole people will be with me until I die. I know that, there is no way
of forgetting something like that. I believe that the remembering of it is part of the
equipment I have been given as a writer. I wrote a poem like “So Who Was the Mother
of Jamaican Art” because I see part of my charge as a writer as laying claim to the
humanity of my ancestors, valorising ‘Quashie’ and putting a face and giving names to the
faceless and nameless bands of men and women who did not just survive, but to some
extent prevailed. I guess the chiaroscuro technique is applicable here too for while I must
attempt to write about the unspeakable horrors of the middle passage and the Atlantic
Slave trade, I must also praise the strength and nobility of spirit which enabled Africans
to survive it, not just survive it as brute beasts, but as artists, musicians and storytellers,
healers, scientists, spiritual leaders and empire builders; that is what I do, I celebrate the
fact that the so called ‘master’ culture was not able to completely annihilate the culture
of the Native Indians and enslaved Africans. I also celebrate the thinking that has gained
greater currency in recent years: that several cultures encountered each other, a great
struggle took place and something new was created as a result. I much prefer that to the
victor and the vanquished version that I grew up with.

MICHELA: Caribbean women writers of recent decades belong to a tradition that
is yet to be fully explored. Now, although the idea of “matrilineage” in Caribbean writing
is slowly finding its place in the current literary discourse, we are still likely to encounter
difficulties when searching for such ‘literary foremothers.’ Their folktales and stories,

which belong to an oral tradition, are often lost or found by chance in rare transcriptions.
