reflects the actual reality of the world you describe or rather your own personal attitude
towards life?

GOODISON: Ah, ‘positiveness’ in my stories. If 1 could, all my stories would have
happy endings, but then my characters would only be cartoon characters. What I will
say is this, I cannot explain this, but from time to time I have been visited by joyful
spirits. | am also quite familiar with the company of darker spirits, but when the agents
of hope and possibility are visiting me then my stories and poems reflect their presence. I
often marvel at my own life; not in any (I hope) boastful show-off triumphalist way, but
with a sense of real amazement. To tell the truth, there are many days when I can identify
with “the stone that the builder refused.” Not that I am now the corner stone, but I do
believe that I have managed not to live down to some people’s expectations of me. You
see I did not come to this business in conventional ways, I started off as a visual artist
who wrote and I have become a writer who hardly ever paints. Some people do not like
that, some people still behave as if I’m something of “a vulgar upstart with no right to
aspire to poetry” (as a critic said of John Keats). And still I write (to paraphrase Maya
Angelou). I have also become a teacher at the University of Michigan, how did that
happen? It certainly was not ever going to happen for me at the University of the West
Indies? I have been blessed with a dear companion in the person of Ted Chamberlin and I
am grateful to be mother to my son, Miles. Look, what I’m saying is this, in my own life I
have seen evidence of this ‘positveness’, I am grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful beyond
measure if I pass some on to my characters. But, honestly, I have seen other people’s lives
powerfully transformed when they began to access something in themselves that was
and is paradoxically, greater than themselves, and even if the conditions of one’s outward
life do not change all that much some people do come into a kind of peace and wisdom
that is remarkable — that is what happens to some of my characters.

MICHELA: All your characters have their own very clear voice; while your voice
as “author” is seldom felt. Characters like Fool-Fool Rose — who is also present in your
last collection of poems, Controlling the Silver — seem to act autonomously. Do you
sometimes find yourself in conflict with your personae — as Pirandello was with his six

characters — and, if yes, how do you resolve the needs of characters and the needs of you

as author?
