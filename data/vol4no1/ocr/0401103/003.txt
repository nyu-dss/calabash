In fact, the vast majority of works by West Indian women writers is out of print. Do you
see a reason for this exclusion, and for the relative silence around this issue?
GOODISON: I must begin by giving thanks that the “half that has never been

told”, i.e. the stories and poems by Caribbean Women writers have gained some currency

in my lifetime. I clearly remember buying a copy of Seven Jamaican Poets in 1968 — all men.

The advent of Mervyn Morris and Pam Mordecai’s Jamaica Woman was a benchmark in
publishing and Caribbean women writers have had more exposure since then. Publishers
like John La Rose of New Beacon Press, Jeremy Poynting of Peepal Tree Press and Ian
Randle of Ian Randle Press have contributed greatly to spreading the word. Also we can
never forget the giant shadow cast by Louise Bennett, who, thanks to Jahan Ramazani,
has finally been included in the Norton Anthology of Contemporary Poetry. What I will
say is this: writers, both men and women, should know that this is a game of chance.
Throughout history there have been great writers who received little or no attention, in
their lifetime, so I think that writers should regularly examine themselves and their
motives as to why they are engaged in this whole enterprise. I guess it is hard to resist
the urge to write whatever we believe will gain us favor with the “powers that be”,
whomever those powers are — publishers, critics, your peers, the buying public — but
there are real risks involved in doing that, and sometimes those risks pay off and
sometimes they don’t. I often say that I have no agenda as a writer, but maybe that is not
true, if | have an agenda this is it: I want to first of all write in a language that accurately
represents the people I write about. I have a great fear of writing as if I'm from middle
earth. I want to write stories and poems that resonate with anyone who is human,
anyone who loves and who has known loss, anyone. I am deeply invested in the triumph

of the “holy fool”, wherever he or she is to be found.
MICHELA: Reading your last collection of short stories, Fool-Fool Rose is Leaving

Labour-in-Vain-Savannah, with its moments of crystallized epiphanies in everyday life of a
small community, one cannot but notice the positive energy of your characters, all
fighters who find hope within themselves, ready to rebuild their lives over the ruins of
their misfortunes. This is quite rare, if we were to think of a somewhat similar small
community narrated by Joyce in Dubliners, for example, where acceptance of fate is more

common than hope and redemption. Do you feel that the ‘positiveness’ in your stories
