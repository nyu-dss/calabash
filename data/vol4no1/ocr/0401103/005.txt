GOODISON: I do wrestle with my characters. Sometimes it takes me years to
finish a poem or a story because I imagine that characters in the poems and stories are
unhappy with the endings. Take a poem like “Annie Pengelly” I had several different
endings, none of which worked, after about a year, I sat down and wrote the ending it
now has, which suggests that both Annie and the woman who owned her, were
enslaved, one by slavery and one by unrequited love; the guard and the prisoner are both
in prison, I don’t know, Annie seemed to want that ending. When I wrote “Baby Mother
and the King of Swords”, I honestly felt as if the women in those stories were telling me
what happened to them and that they were entrusting me to write down their stories. In
one or two of those early stories I think that I might have brought about a different
ending to the one the characters wanted. Like in “Angelita and Golden Days”, ’'m not
sure that Angelita would have rejected Golden Days when he made a “slackness” record
that became a hit, that ending was probably me, the writer as moralist. If I wrote that
story now, I’d probably write it with an open ending.

MICHELA: Your writing seems a mosaic where stories and poems are pieces of
not only a single collection but of a larger design, of a larger body of an ongoing
narration. Would you agree with such a description? And if yes, would you share your
view of this larger body of work?

GOODISON: Yes...That would be true. There are subjects that I keep revisiting
and I suspect that I will keep revisiting for as long as I write. Some of my poems began
their life as ‘leftovers’ from paintings. By that I mean, I would often have an idea for a
painting, ’'d then do the painting but find that I'd not exhausted the idea, so I'd write a
poem about it, I find myself going back to clarify things or to speak about some things in

a different way, especially as I've become more conscious of form.
