THE SNAKE TREE

I am the serpent
Quetzalcoatl, Damballah, and St. Patrick
I melt into the tree that I’m coiled around

Deceitful they thought me

But I bring wisdom

The prophet’s staff slithers on the ground
He lifts it to heal

World’s axis

Maypole

Silk Cotton Tree Samauma
Totem and Mapou

Once they spied me

In plain metamorphosis

They caught me naked between animal and plant
Then they drank of my snake trunk

And tasted for the first time the truth

That the wood of the crisscross vine is meaty
And bleeds deliciously

I am the serpent

Double helix Juramidam
Caduceus staff
Immortal Hoasca
