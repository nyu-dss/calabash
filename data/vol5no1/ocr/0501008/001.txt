by this writing hand
this is your poem
no one else’s
your faces, growing all over
my writing fingers, laughing out loud
biting my nails
your eyelashes, tickling the rouge life lines
of my rougher palm to the barbwire matte of wrist
see-me-see-me-see.you sing like pelican chick
chick come and they come.dig the pulse.draw the dread
beat the heat to heart along cheekbone ridges crawl over
my delta of blood crawling veins part for you
and you pound my knuckles with your chinny chin chin.print
my finger tips on your frowning forehead.rake your nostrils along
the bedrock web of fingers
hold your ear to leathery skin folds on their way to getting old
agate bands of darks and lights to your eyebrows—buh wa t’is yu list’ning for?
as i press,
this is your poem
your hair browse the cusp
bare to a tangle of spitting quests
a suckteeth of questions over and over
but in this mangrove, where you’re also free to learn good manners
there is no one
not even a soul
to tell you go)
to not to belong)
t’ain none to say
you’n from here to where
you from, or to be only the born of here to be
