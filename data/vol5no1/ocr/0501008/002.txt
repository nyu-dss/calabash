this is your poem

1 will not sell you off.hunt you down.put you on

to a crack-up of we self for the false masters’ count/in territories

1 will not lose you in a grin to a fling of thugs and copy things

i will not wince from your eyeball stare

the tongue lashing.defiant to be&doubt to

dust to bust the borders.to affront the frontiers

i will not multi-ethnic you from each other’s only one.

not in this mangrove you making, where ahl yu rooting

to the bruised hand i am fingering on this glass bottle walk of fire
this is your poem

1 swear.t’ yose alone. defiant to be&doubt to dust.

it is a ponum of yes, my love

i will never leave you.
