his hair’s gone gray along with ours)—
we hear their every gracias imply: amigo,
let us be the last resort of your empire.

But how one power ends, the next begins—
that’s beyond us all. Halfway around the world,
in Beijing, thousands labor sunup to sundown

to fill our Banana Republics. A few Yuan
skim the first off a pallet of beach shirts,
then I'll pay eighty dollars for the last,

unbuttoning its silk off the manikin.
His pecs a brazen gold in the shop-glass,
he knows another Medium’s on its way

to cover him. Capital: no more chance
to tame it than to rid the Swan Café
of Chongas—those aboriginal crows

Julio curses and fans three menus at.
Each year they thicken on the netting,
peck a new hole in, raid unbussed tables,

crap on the plates, beguile then terrify
the younger kids. There’s one now, and look:
another’s battling a third over some fries.
