When I opened the door, I noticed Mike’s curly hair was disheveled and wet, but that
wasn’t surprising because the storm had moved in to shore, and the rain was pounding on the
balcony windows. He wore shorts, long socks and beaten up tennis shoes. I ushered him into the

living room.

“What a beautiful view,” he said, running his fingers through his hair and gazing through
the balcony window facing the ocean. I followed his eyes and saw that the storm had kicked up

furious whitecaps.
“Sit down,” I told him.
“I’m kind of sweaty from running,” he said.
“Don’t worry about it. I'll get you something cool to drink.”
I left him perched gingerly on the sofa, and went into the kitchen.

As I was getting out the ice from the fridge, I thought about Mike. His full name was
Michael Pierce Ramirez, son of an American father and a Puerto Rican mother. I had first met
him in college in the late sixties. He was very much involved in radical movements just as I had
been in those days. He often spoke to meetings of the Students for a Democratic Society about
imperialism in his native land of Puerto Rico.

I myself had become disillusioned with the SDS and had moved into a women’s
consciousness-raising group. I was going out with a very domineering political type who
constantly berated me for being a timid WASP with middle class values. The feminist group
helped me navigate my way out of that relationship. I found Mike more sympathetic than the guy
I was going out with, but somehow nothing worked out romantically. We picked up our
friendship again in the early seventies when I moved to the island with my husband.

I placed a pitcher of lemonade on the coffee table and poured two glasses. Mike drank
thirstily and asked for more. He downed the second glass in several gulps, picked up some exam
papers, and glanced through them.

“T see you're still teaching English.”
“Yeah.”
“Your students aren’t doing too well.” He held up an exam covered with red marks.

“Tt’s tough for them when they get to the University,” I replied. “English isn’t taught well

in the public schools.”
