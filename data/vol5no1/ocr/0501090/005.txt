“That’s OK. Just leave it there. Il hang it again later,” I told him.

Mike propped up the picture against the wall and sat down on the sofa.

“Carrie, I have to be careful. You remember Alfredo Jiménez, the independentista lawyer
who was murdered?”

“You mean the one that defended the Teamster boss?”

“Yeah. Luis Santander.”

I nodded, remembering that Santander had been charged with corruption.
“Alfredo did a beautiful job proving his innocence,” said Mike.

He was right about the lawyer’s skill. I had followed the drama of the trial in the
newspapers. Jiménez had won the case by convincing the jury that the chief witness against the
labor leader, the one that alleged he saw money changing hands, was an underworld figure

himself who would testify to anything the government asked to get off drug charges.

“Alfredo’s death is a great loss,” Mike continued, shaking his head. “La pérdida de un

gran patriota. Did you know he lived across the street?”

“Yes. I knew him to say hello. I couldn’t believe it when he was killed. I saw the blood

on the sidewalk for days.”
“Yeah. They said it was a carjacking.”

“The other theory was that Jiménez himself was involved with drug trafficking.” I

pointed out.

“Tt’s a smear campaign.” Mike raised his voice. “The dead can’t defend themselves.”

“T never believed a word of it,” I replied. “He was such a nice man. Always smiled and

asked after my daughter.”

“He became too popular after winning the case,” said Mike. “Jiménez was the only man
that could have forged an effective alliance between labor and pro-independence forces. They

had to cut him down.”
“So you wanted the San Juan Star to dig further?”
“Yes, but I’m telling you this in confidence.”

“T won’t tell anyone, except Jeff, of course.”
