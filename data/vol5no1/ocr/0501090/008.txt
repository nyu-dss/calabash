body was warm. For a moment I though that the lie I told Mike about Karen having a fever had
become a self-fulfilling prophecy, but then I realized that it was just the normal warmth of a
child waking from her nap. I could smell the sweet sweat on her hair. Still holding her tight, I
reached over and bent one of the bedroom blinds down with my finger to look out the window

that faced the street.

Water from the heavy downpour was still rushing along the gutters. Mike emerged from
under the canopy that shaded the entrance to my building onto the sidewalk. He stopped at the
curb, and looked to the right and the left before crossing the street to the other side. I watched
him walk toward the traffic light at the corner, with that loping gait I knew so well. He still
looked like a college kid with shorts, old tennis shoes and a tangled mop of curly hair. Just as I
was about to let the blinds close, a well-dressed man in a suit crossed over to the same side of the
street and walked in the same direction, about ten paces behind Mike. They both disappeared

round the corner. I shuddered and held my daughter closer.
