“That’s not the real problem,” said Mike.

It didn’t surprise me that Mike thought he knew more about the problem than I did
although he had no teaching experience. He was that kind of guy, extraordinarily bright and well

read, but opinionated as hell.
“Well, of course, English is not their native tongue,” I said.
“Exactly,” said Mike. “They see it as an imposition of the colonial power.”
“T don’t know. Most of my students want to learn English to get ahead in the world.”
“That’s what colonialism does. It undermines the worth of native language and culture.”

I didn’t reply. He had a point, but it was a job with flexible hours that meant I could
spend quality time with my daughter. Besides, I enjoyed teaching and my students liked me.
“Beautiful apartment you’ ve got here,” Mike remarked. “Pfizer must be doing very well.”

Tignored this.

“If what you’re saying is that anyone teaching English is an agent of U.S. imperialism,” I

said, “why are you working for an English-language newspaper?”

“I’m not working for the San Juan Star anymore.”

Come to think of it, I had not noticed Mike’s byline recently. I wondered what had
happened.

“Estella left me,” Mike added.

“Tm sorry.”

“She thought she was the wife of a future Pulitzer Prize winner. But she made a mistake.”
“Mike, that’s not fair.”

Mike shrugged.

Estella, a poet and an independentista, had never struck me as a woman looking to snare

a man with prospects. She was petite with a ready smile and a great sense of humor.
“Estella was in love with you,” I told him.
Mike frowned. “She wanted to have a baby.”

“But you didn’t?”
