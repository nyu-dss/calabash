“Tt’s not that I don’t like kids. But it’s crazy to want to bring another human being into

this miserable fucking world.”

Ten years ago I might have agreed with him, but not since my daughter Karen was born.
Her existence made up for whatever was wrong with the world. Besides, if Mike had really cared
about Estella, he wouldn’t be hiding behind leftwing clichés when the woman he loved wanted a

baby. But it was no use trying to explain this to him.
“Why did you leave the Star?” I asked.

“T just couldn’t hack it any more. They wouldn’t let me work on an important story.”
Mike paused and began to run his fingers along the embroidered Guatemalan designs of

the throw cushions on the sofa where he was seated.

“We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to,” I said.

“T want to, but you never know who’s listening.”

I looked at him. He had not changed expression.

“There’s no one here but me and my daughter,” I told him. “Jeff's in New Orleans.”

Mike got up and in a business like fashion removed the cushions, running his fingers
around each one and then around the sofa frame, before replacing them neatly.

“Mike, what are you doing?”

“Tt could be bugged.”

“Don’t be silly.”

He walked over to a painting by Roberto Moya depicting a mother bending over her child
on a tricycle and peered at it. For a moment, I thought he was thinking about the baby he could
have had with Estella.

“Moya has a special way with children,” I remarked.

“Sentimental bullshit,” said Mike. “He’s gone commercial.”

Still staring at the painting, he ran his fingers lightly round the frame. Then he removed
the picture and examined the back. I noticed his right hand was shaking when he tried to
replace it on the hook on the wall.

“Watch out!” I yelled, just as the picture fell with a thud. Luckily it was an oil painting
that had been framed without glass.

“Calm down,” said Mike. “It didn’t break.”

“Mike, what’s wrong with you?”

“Nothing.”
