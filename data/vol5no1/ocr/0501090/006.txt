“Not even Jeff,’ Mike barked.
“OK,” I replied, thinking it was best to go along. Mike was really agitated.
“T was getting close to the truth. That’s why they fired me.”

“What are you doing now?”

“T launched my own investigation a year ago. I’m close to a major breakthrough,” Mike

said loudly, clenching his fist. “Someday justice will be done.”

He brought his fist down hard on the coffee table. I reached out with one hand to steady

his teetering lemonade glass.

Mike took my hand in his and looked into my eyes. “Carrie, there are dark forces

blocking the light of truth.”

Although the rainstorm had brought cooling breezes that took the edge off the glaring
heat, he was sweating profusely. Mike had always been a man intensely absorbed in whatever
interested him in the moment, it was part of his charm, but I had never seen him quite like this.

I withdrew my hand. He continued talking.

“They’re following me, but I’m not afraid. They will never be able to get me. I guess
they won’t be looking for me at the luxury Condado apartment of Pfizer’s Vice President for

Operations in Puerto Rico,” he said with a smile.
“Mike, who do you think is following you?”

“Don’t worry, Carrie. I lost them just before coming here. I would never do anything to

put you in danger.”

“Do you want some more lemonade?” I asked, reaching for the pitcher. Mike didn’t
answer. I spilled some on the table while pouring.

“Tll get a sponge from the kitchen,” I said, rising from my chair.

“NO, don’t go. Carrie, look at me.”

He was watching me intently.

“What is it?” I asked, sitting down again.

A streak of lightning was followed by a quick boom of thunder, loud and close. In the
silence that followed came the question, “You weren’t going to make a phone call, were you, to

tell them I’m here?”
