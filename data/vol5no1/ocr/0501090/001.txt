Heavy Downpour

A sudden gust of wind lifted the exam papers on the coffee table and scattered them at
my feet. I rushed to the balcony that overlooked the Atlantic. In the tropical sunshine, the
waves close to shore were bright turquoise fading into deep blue as the eye moved further out.
Billowing gray clouds were piling up on the horizon, streaked with rain. After each dart of

lightning, I counted the seconds to see how long it would take to hear the boom of thunder.

The runners of the sliding windows were corroded by the salt air. By the time I had
closed them and sat back down to finish correcting exams, I was dripping with sweat, my thin
blouse sticking to my skin. I went down the hallway to check on my five-year old daughter
who was fast asleep in the bedroom. The intercom buzzer rang. I rushed to answer before she
woke up, thinking it could be the postman with the parcel my mother had sent special delivery

for her birthday.

“Hola. ¢Quién es?

“Soy yo. Mike.”

I rang the buzzer to let himin. Ihadn’t seen Michael Pierce for about a year. I used to
see him and Estella every month or so, but he had disappeared from those American parties in
Puerto Rico, not that I could blame him. There was entirely too much drinking and constant
whining about the heat, the traffic, and the general lack of efficiency. At one of these parties,
Mike had proposed a toast, “To Puerto Rico! Love it or leave it!” An uneasy silence followed.
When we got home my husband Jeff told me, “Of course, he’s right, but it’s hard to leave when

Pfizer pays better here than in the States.”
