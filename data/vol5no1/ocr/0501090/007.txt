“Mike, don’t talk nonsense. [’m your friend. And I don’t even know who they are.”
“T carry this.” Mike drew out a knife that had been concealed in his thick running sock.

“Just in case.”
I sat very still, my eyes fixed on the pitcher, but I could see the knife in his hand.

“Tm a non-violent man,” continued Mike, “but I’m not stupid. The CIA caught Alfredo

unarmed, but not me.”
The knife had a short handle but the blade was long and sharp.
“IT can defend myself. Like this.” Mike lunged, his knife tracing an arc through the air.
