Goodison’s mother.

Caribbean art transcends a single, well defined categorization, and Caribbean artists
usually express themselves in more than a single art form — they are poets and performers,
painters and writers, historians and novelists. Lorna Goodison is all of these, and her many
talents partake in the composition of her latest oeuvre.

In her painter’s hands the sheet of paper becomes a canvas on which she draws the
portrait of four generations of women and men, at times with bold strokes of colorful oil paint, at
others with the delicacy of water-colors.

Like a medieval troubadour she transforms her characters’ lives into eternal myths to be
sung and remembered by future, spellbound generations. We too are mesmerized by this song of
endurance and resilience which chronicles the lives of strong women and men we come to care
about, rooting for them to fulfill their dreams. However, the troubadour’s song 1s a true story, not
fiction, a story of real people (most of whom we’ ve already met in Goodison’s poems). The
troubadour merely chronicles their fortunes with no authorial intervention to change the course
of the story.

We can only witness the unfolding of their lives, admiring Doris’s courage and strength
in her journey from Harvey River to Malvern and down to “hard-life Kingston”; understanding
George O’Brian Wilson’s longing for the “rim of light” from Leanna’s soul, sharing his pain at
the hopelessness of his dream; and weeping at Howard’s death as we sit next to Margaret “by the

window in the front room of the house.”

The task Lorna Goodison had set for herself was paramount, yet everything is controlled with
such lightness and mastery, that never once do we get confused by the frequent time-shifts that
transport us back and forth through generations, or by the multitude of characters who people the
story, each with her or his own distinct qualities. Like a skillful weaver Goodison interlaces the
dozens of threads that make up the lives of her family members together with ancient river tales
and African legends. Thanks to her powerful and magnificent prose, a mix of Creole and
Standard English, an enchanted tapestry takes shape and comes to life in front of our eyes. All
senses participate in this feast, we savor the sweet raisins, the currants, the prunes and cherries of
Jamaica, we quench our thirst and get drunk on rum and wine, we spice our food with garlic,
pimento and onion, then relish the yam, the cassava and the breadfruit. Flora and fauna, birds

and flowers are summoned by Goodison’s evoking power as we are surrounded by the sounds
