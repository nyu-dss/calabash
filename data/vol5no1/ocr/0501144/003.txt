and scents of the Garden of Eden.

Reverberations of her previous works shine through the narration, interlaced with historical facts,
description of how the towns, the streets, the tenement yards were laid and shaped. We become
familiar with the names of each place, and feel, almost remember, that we’ve been there once
and long to go back.

Here and there names of great poets, artists, and historical figures and events pop up from
the pages, mixed with detailed geographical references to different places. We move from
Ireland to England, to Africa, to Canada, to Jamaica — Harvey River, Malvern, Kingston... The
finely and accurately painted backdrop against which all characters move and act reflects the
enormous research work that Goodison has undertaken in writing this memoir.

Indeed, this is more than a mere family memoir, more than a journey, more than a novel
based on real lives — it is a pilgrimage from the personal to the universal, a throbbing, moving

piece of history.
