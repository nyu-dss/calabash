YESTERDAY

yesterday, there was a collision in heaven,

and one of us soaked in a sea of confusion before falling-
falling from the azure sky .

you cried and clung to the hem of my purple pleated skirt,
the one you said could blend with the horizon at sunset.
but I unfurled your silky-soft fingers, silky like dew-kissed
sunflower petals and watched you plummet.

once upon a time, I thought we could substitute

our fingerprints and the world would be oblivious.

was it on thursday that we smiled our knowing smile?
what’s happened to us since?

maybe the halcyons gliding across the cerulean sky knew.
maybe the cumulous clouds murmured our secrets.
maybe they knew.

maybe they’re not as benign as they sing.
