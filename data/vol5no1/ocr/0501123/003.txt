story or I experience something when talking to someone and I write the idea down to later on
work on it. When that happens, what comes out is what itis. Of course, there are always going
to be times when something I write will be a product of my therapeutic work. I hear voices that
come to tell me stories. It could be that I hear an aspect of the story or perhaps it could be that I
have experienced it. What comes out in the narrative is nothing like real life. The writer in me is
not thinking about the therapeutic part to make it converge. That would never work. Writing
cannot be forced, planned or turned into a strategy; writing has to flow from a source of wisdom
that is inside of us and which allows us explore the interior that calls to be explored. It could be
different for other writers, it could be that they have to research, organize, make sketches and
plan the strategies and even anticipate what is going to happen with each one of the characters. I
discover what is going to happen as I write. Most of the time I am very happy with the results.

adolescent and also because of the stories I hear in my psychotherapeutic practice, which
specializes in women, especially young women and their struggle to survive.
MM: How do you see the young women’s world today?
AB: My perspective right now focuses on my experience with young Latino women who attend
the university. Many of them are trying to make the most of the opportunity given to them in
order to progress economically and I see more and more of them are graduating. I can see a
powerful psychological and spiritual force in the Latino women. A force that gives them
integrity even though they suffer emotionally, and feel betrayed and abused. They still keep on
going ahead, learning from their experiences, and using them as opportunities to create.
MM: What do you think about the connection between therapy and literature?

AB: I find that there is a connection between writing and healing. I believe that by writing you
can cure yourself. I believe that people are always moving towards a place of healing, a place

where they feel complete and they do this in various ways; for me this comes with writing and
