charge.

When I finished the collection of stories I wanted to be published by Curbstone Press
because of their social mission and their commitment to publish Latino authors. I sent the book
twice to the Miguel Marmol prize and I did not win, but they called me to tell me that I was a
finalist, that they liked my stories and to not give up. I continued editing and the collection of
stories started to improve. In December of 2005, I sent the manuscript again and in April of 2006
they called me to tell me I had won and that it was going to be published in 2007. It is incredible
how things work out. Right?

Now when I see a book I know for sure the persistence, the faith and the strength the
author needed, and that publishing it was not easy. The day I saw the advance copy I was
reading in New London, Connecticut, and when the editor, Sandy Taylor*, put it in my hands, it
felt like a baby. I hugged it in front of almost forty people and they understood how profound it
was for me.

Note to the reader: I am sad to say that Sandy Taylor, cofounder and editor at Curbstone

Press, passed away on December 2007. He is missed by many.
