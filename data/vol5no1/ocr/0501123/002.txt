world, both American and Dominican?

AB: I love literature and I try to read as much as I can about both, American and Dominican. I
first started writing after I read Dominican literature. When I was 13 my parents decided to
move back to the Dominican Republic from the Bronx. They registered me at the Colegio

Santo Domingo and that’s when my love for literature began. I could see poetry and literature in
every aspect of the country. It was in everything from newspapers to magazines, and most of all,
among my friends who were able to recite entire poems, which impressed me a great deal.

Back then writing, narrative or poetry was part of my life. | [loved novels and dramas,
because there was a lot of philosophy and socio-cultural analysis in them, such as Unamuno and
Lorca’s work. I thought I wanted to be a playwright because I liked seeing how the interiors of
people’s minds were demonstrated in their actions, thoughts, and words.

Later on, when I had to return to the United States, my teachers in school became also my
mentors and introduced me to a whole new world of literature; there was already an established
love for what I had learned in Santo Domingo. I was once again living in the Bronx, where there
was a profound transition between the Jewish, Latino, and Afro- American communities already
in place. The Jews living in my building still had the marks of the Holocaust with the bar code
tattooed on their arms. My two teachers, one Jewish and one Spanish, were like my parents and
they helped me immensely. My Jewish teacher introduced me to Jewish literature and I began
reading about the Holocaust and at the same time my Spanish teacher would help me continue
my readings of Spanish and South American authors.

My literary education became more solid every time I visited Santo Domingo on my
summer vacations and I would sit at the La Trinitaria bookstore and read about sociology,
psychology, poetry, essays, stories and novels. Virtudes Uribe, the owner is the sister of my
stepmother, Cristina Uribe de Baez, two very sophisticated and educated women who were very
proud of my love for Dominican literature. I read works by authors like Angela Hernandez,
Aurora Arias, Chiqui Vicioso and many more. I remember on one occasion as I was flying back
into the US I was stopped by immigration because they needed to check my luggage and make
sure it was just books I was carrying. It was very amusing.

MM: In your narrative there seems to be a back and forth between the woman writer and the
therapist, what do you think about that?

AB: I don’t think much about the convergence of the writer and the therapist. I don’t think about
my writing being therapeutic or not. I don’t think like that. I write from an

intimate place that reflects my surroundings. It could be that sometimes I would hear a good
