painting. I sit down to write and I write, but sometimes when I want to touch something in a
different place that is more intimate and profound with my writing I paint, make an artistic book
or design, tiny boxes to give as gifts to my friends. The meditative state permits the stories to
flow.

It’s not like I sit down and dictate the stories; the stories write themselves and in the
process there comes a fluid energy within the writing and so as I am always growing and
transforming myself it certainly fits my manner.

MM: This refers me back to the kind of writing I practice, embodied writing; it is written from
the body and using all the senses.

AB: If I allow the story to flow out of me when I write, through my body, my being on the
page, then the story comes out naturally and with a unique purpose. I think that writers, like
painters are connected to the world in a very spiritual way. We have a sensitivity to what
surrounds us and we use that sensitivity to create, and in the creation we feel connected to the
world. We connect to the world in a very different way, very sensitive or multi-sensorial. I
see the world in a different light, with more vivid colors, the scents are more profound. Touching
things is more profound, the body processes experiences and helps us put them down on paper.
Whether I share it or not comes later, and I like that freedom.

MM: When did you realize you could write stories?

AB: [ have great respect for writers. Before I used to look at books not having any idea about the
many days and nights the writer spent in solitude, sometimes without the understanding of those
surrounding him or her. Other times I would imagine writers writing in a café with a
cappuccino while talking about interesting things with friends and enjoying the work. I did not
imagine the dedication and faith needed to write. To write a story is not like sewing cloths, or
like cooking a splendid meal that the family would enjoy, or like a piece of art that after we
finish we hang on the wall. One writes alone, and alone one has to give validity to the writing
piece. I would write a story, and re-write it a thousand times, and if I had the fortune to have a
friend with me I would ask for a critique to know if the story was turning into something I
could read in public or publish somewhere. At the beginning these readers were my husband
David and my best friend Michael. But then it got to a point when even the people who love
you didn’t want to be your critics. At some point I started to participate in literary groups where
we would critique each other, in a trusting space, but that costs money. In essence, one has to
accept that one is alone in this world, and has to learn to hear the music from the soul telling us

that the story is okay, or perhaps look for a literary community where there is no monetary
