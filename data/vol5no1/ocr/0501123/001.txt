Interview with ANNECY BAEZ

My Daughter’s Eyes is the title of Dominican writer Annecy Baez’s first book, winner of
the 2007 Miguel Marmol prize from Curbstone Press, one of the most prestigious independent
presses in the United States focusing on disseminating the work of Latino writers in the United
States.

Baez came to the United States at a very young age, and was raised to be a woman in
charge of her destiny and a facilitator of the destiny of many others. Aside from being a writer
she also works as a psychotherapist, holds a doctorate in social work, and currently directs the
Counseling Center at Lehman College in the Bronx. We are united by many ties, both
professional and personal. The two of us believe in the healing power of words and the infinite
possibilities within humans to heal themselves. As someone who watched the seventeen stories
within this book grow and evolve, I present them with great pride and confidence.

Baez is a writer of high sensibility and an intelligence that allows daily life to dress up
and pose graciously in her stories—at once elegant, real, and full of humanity. In A4y Daughter’s
Eyes the narrator navigates with wisdom the different aspects of Dominican culture, presented
from an open-minded perspective that is free of prejudice, and in which the feminine and
masculine interact to portray human struggles.

Aside from this volume, Baez has also published poetry in different magazines and
anthologies in the United States and the Dominican Republic, such as the magazine Caudal’ s
publishing her story “The Red Shoes.” Baez has also extensively published articles and essays in
the field of psychology, mostly about mental health issues among Latinos in the United States.
