A JOURNAL OF CARIBBEAN ARTS AND LETTERS

SHANTIMEE

Can you remember how it was,

how it must still be?

The pat, pat of the morning's rain

still leaks through Avocat roofs

when from the tops of the hills

the sage light spills

starching the day

to its evening routine.

Miss McLean catches the moment

to air her sheets,

Mother Christy shakes her flour

to see if it still dry

or turn half to dumpling dough already,
and the Lafitte boys

run across the bridge to fetch

two piece of jackass corn from the shop
and have to turn back

because tap, tap,

down the shoot of the valley

pours the grain of the next storm,

drum hailing, thickening, thickening.
Other sounds drown â€”

tree frog's chirp, woodpecker's tattoo,
boys' laughter, all done,

except the Shantimee's roar,

pounding, plunging, rolling rocks along
grinding janga, mullet, and eel,

making the river maid groan.

I know you remember
how all the day's light
seems to burn after the adamant dawn
