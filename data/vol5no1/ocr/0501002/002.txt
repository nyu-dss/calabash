just long enough to launder

your week worn trousers and two khaki shirts
and yourself under the falls

three or four chains up from the bridge,
long enough for old Masâ€™ Harold

to stir and fetch

a pint of johncrow batty rum

from the shop at Silver Hill,

long enough for Brownman

to squat and crack more rockstone

to pave a road that could lead
nowhere but to heaven.

You did lay your youth

with your drying clothes

on the biggest rock

to catch the sun

and breathe the cedar air.

You remember how you have to run
as the hills turn quickly to cloud

and the first rain pierces the morning
and the Shantimee leaps

to reap otahiti and rose apple

from low hanging branches

of trees that drink bravely

at its banks.

Remember how the man named Shine
would stand on the bridge

and stare skyward in the night
awaiting a reprieve of stars

and never say a word of greeting

till him see one,

and how we could never see

if him feet quite touch the ground

on those darkest nights

and how you did swear

that the light of his kerosene bottle
did split one time

into the fiery eyes of the diabolic calf.
We did flee the sight

and climbed the night

to the safety of the chapel on Avocat hill
but did stop dead when we hear

the pale priest from Kingston

cry out from the sanctuary,

"Nil violentum durabile!"

For him did hear before we

in the hush of him prayers

the down, down thunder
