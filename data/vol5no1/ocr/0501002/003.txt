pressing out the molasses storm,
thickening, thickening,

as the Shantimee rolls

tossing stones, oppressing sleep,
pounding, rocking, plundering.

Yes, memory like the Shantimee

in the dry season

seems to stop dead

until I sit down with you

and in our minds the lightning cracks
the wind blows back

and the tongue rolls with names

like rocks torn loose in the riverbed â€”
Dimples, Uton, John the Nyahman,
Santa, Goldie, and Bonny J.

You wonder if the bamboo church
downstream at Mullet Hall

still dances with defiant spirits

and I dream that the chalkboard

in the schoolroom at Avocat

still sings with Brother Mais's summons
to come back to the hills.

But is no wonder and is no dream
that down with the dark

this very night

still pours a Portland storm

like the sea claiming the hills back
and Shantimee uncoils, quickens,
calls.
