except for periodic
fish trailing greenish-blue light
through the water.

The further we float away,

the darker it gets, murky depths
underneath. You claim

that we will find our way

but I am nervousâ€”

we hear random voices

from the shoreline, try to aim
ourselves back. You are paddling
but I am unable to steer,

the refulgence is more than I can bear.
