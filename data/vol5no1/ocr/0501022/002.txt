Calabash: A Journal of Caribbean Arts and Letters is an international literary journal
dedicated to publishing works encompassing, but not limited to, the Anglophone,
Francophone, Hispanophone and Dutch-speaking Caribbean. The Journal is especially
dedicated to presenting the arts and letters of those communities that have long been
under-represented within the creative discourse of the region, among them: Aruba and the
Netherlands Antilles, Maroon societies, and the Asian and Amerindian societies of the
region. Calabash has a strong visual arts component.
