they'll underscore, usually the ritual it takes to get into the “zone,” or the knowledge that getting
up from a satisfying day at the desk, the writer might be faced with nothing and no one with
whom to share the lively world invented purely in their mind.

It’s the threshold in either direction that hampers us, not the writing itself. Some will do
anything to escape the reality of living between worlds but still they are brought back to the
living page because there can be nothing like the feeling of transmuting one’s thoughts and
visions into solid form for others to consume. Yet, what I’ve discovered in the last several
years, six of them afflicted with the symptoms of unrelenting chronic fatigue syndrome, is that
writing isn’t as solitary as it seems nor as sedentary. In the attempt to regroup after the loss of
my own vital energy, I’ve discovered that I was never more social as when I wrote and in
teaching others how to find their inner muse; I’ve found that writing is intensely physical and
have found no better metaphor for the physicality of writing than dance.

When I first fell ill with debilitating CFS and decided after much duress and anxiety to
take a leave from my position as a tenured professor of English at a State University, I retreated
to a seaside house in California shared with two older friends in the midst of completing their
doctoral degrees. We had an understanding that we would live together in wellness and that we
would do everything to maximize healing and minimize toxicity in the household. For me, this
meant that I did not have to explain sleeping for ten hours at a time or in the middle of the day or
why it took me an hour to walk up and down the cliff side walk near our house, a distance that
would take others ten or fifteen minutes. I could keep my own hours. Talk if I wanted. Keep
my silence. All the while, I meditated and tried to find answers to my physical collapse,
answers that I had not been able to find through medical practitioners.

Never one to climb mountains, low on stamina, I was hard-pressed to explain my current
state of extremely low energy. I had come from a family that did not believe in women
exerting energy so my body was not trained to build energy but I had gone against the family
current in my teenaged years and young adulthood, by necessity, for self-protection, and taken
up muscle-toning as well as other forms of exercise. By my mid-twenties, shortly before the
chronic fatigue hit, I could claim to cross-train, exercising three to five times a week with
bodybuilding at a local gym, rollerblading, and running for twenty to forty minute spurts. My
metabolism ran high when I followed this regiment and my writing continued to flow. And
then, it seemed all of a sudden, all systems stopped firing. My writing appeared to have piqued
at twenty-eight; soon thereafter a stranger stalking incident compounded early burnout and a

morning run left me unable to function for the rest of the day as did any other kind of exercise.
