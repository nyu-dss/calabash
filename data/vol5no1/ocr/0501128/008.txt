malaise, like alcoholism or manic-depression. Though such cases exist, and they are legendary,
the writer who keeps writing must function in society and with some mobility, must have some
purpose of social intercourse leading her or him back to the desk. There is no other way about
it. Even those who maintained destructive habits during their writing life but who were intent
on continuing to write knew how to make a space for the writing itself; the rest was fodder, if it
could be remembered. The raw material for the writer is nothing more or less than the stuff of
life.

We take “living” so for granted that when the flow of life becomes interrupted, it
becomes clear what feeds art and vice versa. It also becomes clear when one attempts to walk
the beginner through the techniques of one’s art. Trying to explain to a beginning writer why
their character is “flat” as opposed to “round,” or their language empty of feeling, and they will
tell you that they are describing what they see and what they feel but, often, what they’ve
forgotten in the process of translating lived experience onto the page is how to inhabit their
subject by using not the mind but the body as their main processing tool.

In her Peabody-award winning documentary, A Dancer’s Life, Martha Graham went to
pains to illustrate that the life of dancers upon the stage was not just mere mimicry but a
deliberate bringing together of the theatrical and corporeal. Dancers had not only to remember
bodily movements but they had to remember their character upon the stage. They had both to
be utterly present within the body and removed from it in order to turn in a valid performance.
Through the documentary, Graham demonstrates this transformation by narrating the film as she
begins to don the costume of Medea; she puts on makeup and costume in her first articulation of
the character. She explains that a dancer must learn everything they can about their character,
how s/he moves, their posture, their attitude; how that being communicates itself through the
body, without words, only the body. Then comes the choreography that pulls together
appearance and knowledge to tell a story. The training of her dancers is unveiled as rigorous
and disciplined but also as communal. There is no story upon the stage without a group
dynamic which allows each character to be revealed to the audience, however minor their role.
Every dancer yearns to be a star, says Graham, but they cannot aspire to be soloists without first
being in the corps, then graduating to smaller group dances, then to the pas de deux. The solo
is an outgrowth of a group experience, or community of dancing partners. By the time the
soloist is ready for the spotlight, he or she has learned both to yield to discipline and to forego
their ego. The body having lent itself to something greater than itself, both character and story

can emerge. The foundational context of the dance contributes to the staged setting and
