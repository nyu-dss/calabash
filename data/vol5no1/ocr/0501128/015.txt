call, like the popping of plastic bubble wrap between the fingers. We normally do not have to
think about movement. We move. But the dancer moves to choreography that has been
rehearsed again and again until it becomes a language that the muscles remember with little
prompting. When the body begins to fail through illness, movement, like a creative process,
must be learned ina new way. The object is not to move as one once did but to move in a new
direction, to rehearse the beneficial change. Internally, the shift feels like a mutation on a
cellular level, a new order that, like art itself, is demanded by the body aching for its longevity.
If the call is ignored, disease sets in like a cancer in the marrow, and does not lose its grip.
Dance thus offered me the metaphor for recovery.

My body is retraining me, composing me, like a demanding choreographer. I began to
learn other languages, a smattering of German, some Japanese. Italian took hold more deeply
than the other languages and I eventually lived in Italy for some months, recuperating, finding a
new way to connect words. Iwalked. Ilearned Tai Chi, Yoga, Qi Gong, exercise designed to
be slow, thought out, a process. I learn how much sleep 1s needed to get through the days even
though no two days are the same. When I am overworked, I sleep for two to three hours at the
end of the afternoon and early evening. At night I sleep at least nine hours. And the writing,
eventually, graciously, returns.

When I sleep, I see myself dancing across a stage in slow motion, like Paul Taylor in
front of his strobe lights, a dance he was famous for in the early nineties. Suspended in mid-air,
his feet appeared to never touch the ground and the audience could not hear the impact of feet
against the boards. He made it seem effortless. But the truth is that behind every creative
process there is effort. The key, dancers have shown me, is not to burn out; there must be more
to the person on the stage than their persona, more than simply yearning to be on the stage.
There must be someone behind the curtain whose face is not waiting to be seen, a passionate
worker whose sweat is hidden in the art he or she eventually unveils to the world, however
imperfect or genius its expression. The artitselfisaveil. Itis a form of artifice. But
through it, whether the story to be told is transmuted through the veil of the body or through a
composition of words, all of it is movement followed by the flickering of eyes across the paper,
or the stage, hungry for glimpses of their own humanity.

So what if the body is broken or breaking down? So what if the words express an
uncertain beauty? What matters is not achieving perfection, it is, rather, the maintenance of the
sacred vessel of the body and mind over time in order to tell some piece of oneâ€™s truth in the

materials at our disposal. The dance, the words: these are the performances, the possessions
