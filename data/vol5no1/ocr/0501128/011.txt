up, breathe out, toe to heel, repeat, in reverse. It takes practice to walk in kinhin with the
fullness of the breath, to take note of the length of it, to pause between each intake and outtake of
air. Once one does, once one masters walking with the breath, the flow, the fluidity that occurs
is, well, breathless, and very, very slow.

Imagine performing Ainhin on a crowded sidewalk, perhaps having picked up your pace
only slightly. The world seems to be moving forward unusually quickly. At the same time, a
whole over world that one would usually miss comes into sight. | On these walks, I noticed
flowers that had bloomed on the cliffs, then a small memorial for a girl of fourteen who had
slipped to her death below, then sea otters floating on the oceean, and, once, far from shore, the
gasp of a whale as it came up for air, sending feet of saltwater spray straight up into the sky
above. While I saw these remarkable sights, from the most mundane to the breathtaking, others
rushed past me, running, or talking without stopping, oblivious to the richness all about them,
consumed by the frenzy of what has come to be known as modern life. If each of us walked in
consciousness of breath, I realized, we would not be so lost in the flurry of activity that we
lament having taken over our lives in most big cities.

When the fatigue hits hard, even now, in remission, when I forget that no bank of energy
will last and that a day of full on activity will be followed by sometimes not only one but perhaps
two or three days of mind-numbing lethargy, that my body will react as if it were elderly and
move at a pace some thirty years in the future, I will try to remember these things that I have
seen, the deeper layers of notice and understanding that have reinvigorated both my teaching and
my return to writing. “Buddhists recognize this,” writes Agnes de Mille, again in Reprieve,
“the state of being aware. If the wind is blowing, they’re aware of walking. If they are
sweeping with a broom, they are aware of the broom, they are aware of the broom and the act of
sweeping.” And, “like a swimmer, I went deeper and deeper into states of being I had never
dreamt of before, states of perceiving and feeling that had nothing to do with achievement or
business or duty or morals. Iwas awake.” Swimming was one of the forms of exercises I
confronted in recovery; as a child I had swam in the ocean without fear. When we had moved
to Canada, for some reason, I feared drowning in pools. I not only had to learn again how to
move through water, how not to fear my feet rising from the bottom of constricted space, but to
trust that the buoyancy of the water could keep the fatigue at bay as I moved, keep me awake
rather than remaining in the dreamless state of sleep that the syndrome demands as if for
payment for having overworked the body beyond its capacity. Everything had to be relearned,
from going with the flow, to breathing.
