Finally — and this is very difficult — you must realize that your situation is changing.
No matter how slowly, itis changing. You will become more — independent week by week.
You will become more able and you must push yourself to do for yourself as far as you can,
no matter how exhausting, no matter how troublesome. The tendency will be to take for
granted that you can’t because up to now you haven’t been able to. You must not rest in
this concept. You must get out of bed if you can. You must walk across the room if you
can. You must fetch and try to lift with care, naturally (you know your own dreadful
limitations). But you must keep trying. This will be exhausting. But you must if you are
to have relationships with the people around you. .... And, ultimately don’t always

talk about yourself as in this book. People are curious and will say they are deeply
interested, but they truly are not. In the first place, they cannot comprehend what you are
telling them. Second they feel inadequate to respond in any intelligent way. And, third, they
are deeply dismayed and rendered uneasy by your example. You are a horrible warning.
In the old days you would have been killed as either useless or a bad luck omen. We
are more temperate and we donot kill these days. But we easily tire and we can avoid. So

Of course, I was not undergoing the same level of disability. I was not recovering from death’s
door. Still, the fatigue that hammered at me had left me incapable of functioning normally and
incapable both of writing as I was used to and communicating verbally as I wanted. My circle
of friends became narrower and, indeed, even those that asked could seldom understand what I
was going through, arguing against my decrepitude by offering platitudes such as the idea that
human beings often tire at the end of the day. It was no use arguing, or explaining, I was too
tired for all of that, and had to preserve what little energy I had to figuring out how to live under
these new conditions and, possibly, how to beat an invisible disease that no one could readily
diagnose and, as such, could not cure. Indeed, once I came upon de Mille’s Reprieve, I
discovered that I was searching less for a diagnosis than for some sign of the possibility of
recovery. What I was looking for was what any writer knows earns him or her his/her bread
and butter: the tools for revision. I was looking not so much for a key to diagnosis, which I
realized by then might never come, but for the tools of my recomposition

Perhaps it was then that I began to understand that, for me, writing had had a dormant
physical component, one that is often ignored in favor of romanticizing an image of the writer

chained to his or her desk, pale-faced, perhaps even suffering from scurvy or some other form of
