raised by a musician, my father, who, at one time, had had as many as three electric organs in the
house, on top of the usual acoustic guitars. I often celebrated what I felt to be a wonderful turn
of phrase or a solid paragraph by singing in my seat, or by getting up and dancing in the living
room. When I was so focused on following the trail of the writing itself that I had no time to
take phone calls, to eat, or to sleep, the end of a period of writing was punctuated by
ravenousness, a fatigued body but also an intoxicating glee. This was the pulse of “divine
dissatisfaction,” the desire to get it right and then, when a manuscript was completed, to do it all
over again. Daytime jags of writing were frequently interrupted by a run in the park, a half
hour of rollerblading or preceded by time in the gym in the early hours of the morning. Writing,
writing which in my depths fe/t successful (for I measured success not by acceptance, 1.e.,
publication, but by a resonance in the soul), drove me and recalibrated my physical and mental
form. Psychologically, writing was a panacea against any form of melancholy. Physically, it
kept me in top form: I exercised; I ate well; I socialized.

In order to write, one has to live, and to live, one has to fully occupy the body, whatever
its state. Writing is not so much an escape from life, I believe, as it is a possession, a trance not
so far removed from vodou rituals through which the body becomes a vessel for something more
than itself and becomes a portal for communion, not only with the gods, but with the perhaps
more enigmatic complexities of mere mortals. By the time I fell ill, I had yet to have read the
source of the above quote itself, de Mille’s memoir. But when I did, I began to understand the
relationship between dance and words in a way that I had only intuited. De Mille, of course, by
virtue of her dual-expression through words and the body already knew the way.

At the height of my illness, I wondered if Graham’s quote still applied. I was blocked at
all levels. Not only could I no longer run, rollerblade or lift weights, I could no longer even
think. No, I did not stop being able to process everyday thoughts or lose my basic ability to
communicate. But there was an entirely frightening moment when, on fellowship that Fall of
2001 in the South of France at The Camargo Foundation, I tried to write a few lines and,
entranced by a thought, I rushed to write it down. As I attempted to write the sentence, I was
confronted with the meaninglessness of a two-letter word. The word: is. An ‘1’ followed by
an ‘s’ suddenly meant nothing and I struggled to remember what this word could mean, if,
indeed, it had any meaning at all. For five minutes that seemed like an eternity, I struggled with
these letters, my pen poised over paper, my eyes fixed on the blue waters of the Mediterranean
before me. It suddenly dawned on me that this word should be easy and that there was

something very wrong. The more I struggled, the more the meaning of the letters evaded me.
