Panic mounted with frustration and just as I was about to question my hold on language itself,
meaning returned. /s, fo be, an action verb. The most overused verb in the English language.
Relieved, I wrote the word down but, by then, the struggle over, I had lost the thought that I had
been trying to write.

It was as difficult to read, at leastin English. I began to gather that there was a
connection between the fatigue and the fact that I functioned almost entirely in my second
language rather than my first, a second language acquired at age ten and professionalized
through years of higher study, while my first language, French, atrophied. I was lucky to be in
France then, even working with only what seemed like one cylinder of a four-cylinder mind. I
could read biographies and /es actualités. Tt was through the French newspapers that I learned
about 9-11, five days late, six days after I had eaten in a restaurant at the foot of the towers trying
to evade defecating pigeons.

I was diminished, surely, but I was alive, and I wondered what Graham’s quote should
mean, what it was that I was left to bring to the world, unique to myself, if I was no longer able
to write, or to think, or to read as once I had read, voraciously, like a bottomless well. I
wondered if I could still consider myself a writer as I worked doggedly on a translation that
would not see the light of day. __ I said nothing of my illness to the other fellows in residence.

I hid myself well enough. I spent much of my time in bed, which was not much taxing as my
suite overlooked the Mediterranean, the village harbor, and cliffs of the camargue in the distance.
I surfaced when I had enough energy to get through the hours in the company of others. The
second tragedy of CFS is that it does not “show” and since one emerges when “well,” it is almost
impossible to explain to others. It’s an illness of retreat, one that used to be considered
“psychosomatic” even though the physical repercussions could not be denied if ill-measured. If
one views the illness optimistically, like depression, it is likely that it provides exactly what one
needs, that is, a step back from the world, a space within and beyond the reach of others, in
which to replenish the spent self.

Words would not cooperate. The body would not move. I finally allowed myself to
collapse, to sleep twelve to fifteen hours of the day. When I could function I would work on
the translation, the raison d’étre of my fellowship, and otherwise jot down revelations as they
came to me about illness and survival. I turned to photography for self-expression and reveled
in what my eyes could see. I determined that I was still an artist even if my main expression
had been cut off. It was a painful time despite the explorations into other arts. From

photography I moved to sculpture once returned to California. It was a dark time in which the
