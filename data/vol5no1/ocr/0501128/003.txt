Once able to read four to five books simultaneously over a week or two, I was left struggling to
make sense of words on a page as if I had never read before. Life, as I had known it, seemed to
slowly ebb away. It seemed that writing was lost, perhaps for always.

My undiagnosed state from professional and semi-professionals had run the gamut from
depression to MS to Parkinson’s. Chronic fatigue syndrome and other like ailments were never
mentioned, most likely, I was to discover later, because they are assumed anathema to women of
color who are more often diagnosed as depressed if they are diagnosed at all and seen as
cumbersome complainers who should be able, by constitution, to bear the weight of the world..

This is a quote that has so inspired me over the years that I have passed it on to students in
writing courses, as well as to friends and budding artists/writers struggling with their art, or,
more accurately, with themselves.

In my mid-twenties, I had been writing at what seemed to be a fevered pitch even though
what I produced then trickled into print over a ten-year period. Between 1993 and 1999, I had
produced five book-length manuscripts; I refused a contract on one (a book of literary criticism
arguing for the similitude of writings produced by American men and women of color) not
wanting to complete the requested revisions which called for over-theorizing the text; the others,
two books of criticism and two novels were eventually published, some with minor revisions,
some with no more revision than a change in title. The passion with which I wrote was political

as well as visceral; it was something that I felt in the body. I wrote to music since I had been
