Inevitably, my interaction with my environment and with others slowed to what seemed
tobe acrawl. Since my speech was no longer smooth, I limited conversations to close others
who could tolerate long pauses or guess at what I wanted to say. Since I could no longer write
eloquent phrases, I watched films or listened to music, or read pseudo-spiritual texts hoping they
might give me answers on how to regain my energy. After my relocation to Northern
California, I attempted to find new forms of exercise. I tried to bicycle and discovered that I
couldn’t get very far. I tried to run and found that my body wept. Each attempt left me
sequestered in my bed. Having lost my main forms of exercise, I took up what was left:
walking. Not power walking, or distance walking, just walking.

I read Gail Sher’s contemplative guide to the writer, One Continuous Mistake, and
learned about a form of meditative walking called kinhin:

Kinhin is slow walking meditation (about a half-step per breath) usually

practiced for short periods between longer periods of sitting meditation as a means
of refreshing one’s body, mind, and spirit.

Practice Ainhin in a setting of your choice, then write about what you noticed.

Elsewhere, I found more detailed instructions on breathing and practicing Ainhin. The source
escapes me know but the directives were clear. One had to re-learn how to walk in order to
walk with the breath, in order to learn the actual depth and pace of one’s breath. One has to
feel the entire soul of the foot’s movement from toe to heel as one breathes, in, and then, out.
Both feet are always, somehow, in contact with the ground and each foot lifts and descends in
unison with the intake or outtake of breath. The fluidity of movement resembles Tai Chi at an
even slower pace and eventually acquires the flow of a dance with the self and the earth with
breathing as the conduit between the two.

Neglecting Sher’s instruction to write what I noticed while walking, and despite curious
glances, I began to walk in this way, usually mid-morning on weekdays on the seaside path close
to our house. There were few walkers and runners at this time and I could doasI like. I
remember that time as one of the most healing periods, not just in the midst of this illness, but in
my life. I think that those of us born by the ocean return to it always with a sense of coming back
to self, as if our very bodies are waves upon the shore returning to the wealth of the undertow.
The continuous sight of ocean on a daily basis did something to assuage the constancy of my loss
of home, a pain that recedes with time but is never completely gone. I followed the meandering

path, step-by-step, breath-by-breath. Well, it went more like this: heel to toe, breathe in, foot
