“T have based everything that I had done on the pulsation life,” writes Martha Graham in
her autobiography, Blood Memory, “which is, to me, the pulsation of breath. Every time you
breathe life in or expel it, itis a release or a contraction. Itis that basic to the body. You are
born with these two movements and you keep both until you die. But you begin to use them
consciously so that they are beneficial to the dance dramatically. You must animate that energy
within yourself. Energy is the thing that sustains the world and the universe. It animates the
world and everything in it” (46). Perhaps I became afflicted with CFS to recognize this pulse
of life within me that, until then, I had taken for granted, and not taken care of the way a dancer
must take care of their body in order to have any kind of longevity. Perhaps it was all
happening so that I would eventually find my way back to my source of creativity, which need
not be extraordinary, simply honest and true to what it is I bring to the world, uniquely flawed
but only mine to offer.

In that first year of seemingly unfathomable illness, of days spent sleeping and walking
and endeavoring to eat well, traveling the Monterey Peninsula coast in my car once I was back
from fellowship in the South of France, to see Steinbeck country (as I thought of it then as
Steinbeck had been the first author I had read when learning English; the book had been My Red
Pony), I was unusually drawn to see dance performances, usually staged in Berkeley, San
Francisco. Dance, somehow, still held me in its spell in a way that very little else staged could.
Only now do I realize that dance has continued to teach me even as I failed to take it up as an art.

That year of abrupt changes in ability and energy, I saw Michael Baryshnikov perform a
dance sequence with his White Oak Project dancers that left a distinct impression upon me.

The piece, entitled “The Experts,” and commissioned from young choreographer Sarah
Michelson by Baryshnikov, seemed to puzzle critics who could not fathom the overriding
soundtrack (a roaring car), strangely clad dancers, and set (a floor covered with a huge sheet of
bubble wrap. Indeed, the only thing critic Anna Kisselkoff found interesting in the piece was
the bubble wrap floor covering, who wrote in her review: “snap, crackle, and pop accompanied
every step, and the piece entertained”). It seemed to me that critics had entirely missed the
point of the performance that, for me, was a critique, veiled as comedic performance, of the
exacting art that dance is, whether for the classical stage or for the commercial reviews of
Broadway. The actor/dancers pantomimed restlessness and boredom on the edges of the bubble
wrap, edges representing the “off-stage” area in which dancers made their entrances and exits.
They chatted amongst themselves; one appeared to be smoking. When their turn came, they

seemed to effortlessly make their way across the stage, straight-faced, caring little about the
