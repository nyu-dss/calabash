audience, “experts” plying their trade. The featured virtuoso, Baryshnikov, was presented in
cuffs, arms tied behind his back, in a chiffon Chanel skirt. When his turn came, he crossed the
stage with a bewildered look on his face as if, by some chance of mistaken identity, he had been
taken off the streets and thrust upon the stage. The gender-bending costume had the force of
flattening Baryshnikov’s persona, of displacing it, even, in such a way as to be confusing to the
audience and refusing their access to an accurate representation of their idol. Indeed, he
appears bewilderingly masked thereby undercutting the audience’s expectations and rendering
them all the more transparent by frustrating them. The bubble wrap floor also interrupts
expectation. It effectively disrupts the notion of play in the piece at the same time as it disturbs
the assumed contract between audience and performers — that our disbelief should remain in
suspension: every time a dancer leaps and falls, the bubble wrap explodes, noisily, fracturing the
illusion that dance, when performed at high levels, is effortless. The exploding plastic wrap lets
us know the force with which the body comes into contact with the ground after each leap and
the mind is immediately forced to move between accepting the mock-play of the dance and the
reality of bleeding feet, overextended sinews, muscles warped against the effects of past injuries.
What the piece revealed to me was the extent to which every dance performance is also a play,
one in which the cost of participating with the audience in manufacturing the suspension of
disbelief is absorbed by the bodies upon the stage who otherwise make their performance appear
effortless. Every performance has an impact upon the body; the most successful avoids costing
the body injury but it exacts a cost nonetheless. At the time, every time I heard a bubble pop
upon the stage, I thought I felt it reverberate like the impact of wood against muscle and bone;
later, I thought of the bubbles as cells that one slowly, one by one, crushed. They could have
been brain cells. I thought of them as the energy one drew upon for movement and the cost of
excellence. Then I realized that the ability to perform critique was in itself a tour de force.
Sitting in that audience, knowing myself to be altered on the physical plane in ways
invisible to others, I realized that the genius of Baryshnikov, and of others like him, like Graham
and de Mille, and, indeed, Evelyn Hart, had not only been the perfection of technique and
charisma: what they shared was /ongevity in an art form where most hang up their shoes in their
thirties. At fifty-two years of age and about to announce his retirement, Baryshnikov was
allowing his body and even his persona to be manipulated in a choreography by a woman twenty
years his junior to advance an argument, through the body, about the fragility of the body and the
danger of taking icons and even art so seriously that something greater, what de Mille has called

an “idiom of movement” has been lost. De Mille utilizes this phrase in describing how she
