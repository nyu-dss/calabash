came to train herself as a choreographer over a five-year period: “One does not think out
movement. One moves. One thinks out pattern. One moves well if one is used to moving
and originally if one has developed through exercise a spontaneous idiom of expression. But I
had nowhere to dance, and no company to work with’ (DP 159). The absence of
community, the peer group with which to exercise, to communicate through the body, drove de
Mille to distraction. But it was through this separation from the ordinary that she developed her
own language, her own movements, her own lexicon of dance. I wondered if this, in some way,
was happening tome. At the very least, in watching the White Oak Dance company in
Berkeley that day, I understood that Baryshnikov had not so much defected for America in a
romantic gesture for prosaic Americana (as some critics have contended) and “all that jazz.”

He, better than anyone else of his generation, understood the toll that ceaseless and exacting
leaps for an adoring public would take on the body and psyche. He was willing to retrain his
physique, learn from others, abandon one community to enter another. The exchange
guaranteed not fame (though it brought that too) but longevity, the real metal of an artist. It
was this lesson, I realized, that the illness of chronic fatigue was seeking to teach me.

Any artist has to work with an eye towards the future, towards self-preservation for the
good of the self and of others. Longevity is the antidote to burn-out; it manifests in the ability
to impose limits upon one’s self, to rein in enthusiasm in favor of a long view that will reveal our
better selves, our more mature selves, at some later date we must trust is to come.

When I teach students to write, I tell them to feel their bodies in their seats, to breathe in
and out, to feel themselves in the writing act before they lose themselves to the words they are
about to write out or type. When we workshop pieces, I ask them to listen closely to what they
feelin other’s writing: does the writing awake the senses? Can they feel themselves in the
character’s skin? Do the characters have a physicality that can be confirmed through the
expression of their point of view? Does the writing sing? Can they feel it like a beating heart
within themselves? The secret to this kind of writing is to dance with the character, not to
hover like an outsider on the fringes of their reality. The secret to writing that moves is to be
within the words, to inhabit them like a second skin. It’s not so easy when the body one is
forced to possess is breaking down, or unlikable, or alien, but it is in this discomfort that we
grow, learning what it is to be another so unlike ourselves that we must dig deep to find their
humanity, indeed our own.

My own body grown deficient, what I learned from returning to dance, as a spectator, in

that time, was that the body not only speaks to us, it speaks through us. Disease is a wake-up
