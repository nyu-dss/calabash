atmosphere, completing the greater picture and contributing to the audience’s willingness to trust
the dancers upon the stage.

I have always been drawn to dance for the reasons Graham articulates in her
documentary. It seems to me, as I’ve written earlier, that the dancer’s ability to transcend the
body while inhabiting it is a spiritual act, as close to possession for the vodouisant whereby
communion with the gods is achieved through ritual dance in a community of believers. In
these ritual dances, often one or more believers is possessed by the god worshipped by the
community and takes on all of that god’s affects and personality traits. The possessed’s body is
temporarily borrowed by the god who then speaks through the body to his/her worshippers.
Even the voice of the possessed may change in pitch, giving voice to the god in a tone and
cadence approximating his assigned gender and temperament — both of which may be utterly
different than that of the body inhabited. The alchemy of this transformation is divinely
inspired but conjured through dance. It is the dance that makes the alchemy possible and the
spirit of dance that brings on the possession. But what happens to such communion when the
body falls in disrepair, the words of the stories yet to tell out of reach? ve come to believe that
whatever the state of mind and body, it is the divine spark of creativity in each of us that
burgeons forth and reveals to us the hidden strengths and resources of the body at times when it
seems most fragile and fallible.

A strange thing started to happen to me after the onset of my illness.

When the illness started isn’t quite clear since it took three years to be diagnosed with
CFS (with still a small possibility of a grade of MS so low no one felt it worth it to bother to test
for it). The strange thing that happened was that my level of sensitivity rose. Like a seer, or a
houngan, 1 could suddenly feel other people’s pains and sometimes intuit their thoughts before
they voiced them. It wasn’t as if I didn’t have some of these abilities beforehand -- some say
we all have the capacity for some measure of psychic ability since, as the Buddhists and New
Agers contend, we each form a part of the universal mind. What was different was the intensity
of what I could detect. If someone had suffered a loss or was in emotional turmoil, I would feel a
searing pain in the middle of my chest as soon as I was within a few feet’s range. I would learn
later on about chakras and intuitive empaths but, at the time, it seemed unwelcome information
that only overshadowed the area that had once been inhabited by the worlds of my imagination,
and words. As my body failed to respond to its normal cues, like a tuning fork, it picked up on
the emotional debris all around me as if set on a new course that I could do nothing else than

follow.
