exhaustion of mind and body seemed difficult to distinguish from depression. Today, many
years into recovery, I would venture to say that I was suffering from a spiritual depression but
that is a matter for another essay.

How was it, then, that dance returned to my mind in this state of stasis?

When back in Santa Cruz, I read every memoir I could that dealt with physical illness,
especially those to do with MS or Parkinson’s disease as some of my symptoms ranged from the
loss of motor skills (symptoms which had flared in my teenaged years at times of high stress
without any explanation), to being unable to judge accurately the distance of objects within reach,
to being unable to speak coherently (a temporary subletter in the shared house who had not been
used to my illness thought, at one point, without saying so directly, that I had been drinking), and
then came upon de Mille’s many volumes. De Mille had written not just one memoir but many,
throughout her life, much like Maya Angelou had, the latter beginning her series with Why does
the Caged Bird Sing? De Mille’s memoirs end rather than begin with caging, as I discovered,
when I began to read her Reprieve mostly from my bed in Santa Cruz.

Written at an advanced age, this particular memoir recounts a tragic episode in de Mille’s
extraordinary career, that of suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage minutes before the rise of
the curtain, to find herself not performing but hospitalized, bed-ridden, with a verdict of
indefinite paralysis. She was not expected to live. The memoir recounts first de Mille’s
struggle with losing the use of her body, her life-long tool of expression. She recalls Graham’s
admonition not to be like her, that is, an inveterate perfectionist who was tortured by her passion.
Graham, de Mille was to discover through time, was a genius but also a tortured soul married to
her art but finding the art, as she produced it, wanting. Unlike Graham, de Mille pursued some
amount of balance in her life, marrying and having a son but she still thirsted for Graham’s
acclaim. It was this thirst that had found her fretting behind the curtain that day, replaying the
movements of her choreography in her mind while worrying about the set and other details of the
performance. It was that drive that set a blood vessel to burst in her brain and left her all but
dead. Despair soon turns into gritty determination, however, and de Mille fights the doctor’s
verdict to slowly and painfully regain the use of her body. At first, she cannot speak, and her
editor gives her slips of paper to make notes, soon encouraging her to begin to write her thoughts.
These slips of paper become the genesis of the memoir which I came to be reading many years
later, not knowing what to do about my own body’s much less dramatic collapse, a body much
less used to physical rigor. | De Mille had these words of encouragement to offer her readers

and to others in similar circumstances:
