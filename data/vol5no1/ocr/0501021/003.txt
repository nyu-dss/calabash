including her husband
leaving for the store
and not returning

from then on she read

the water in her own body
the moisture buried under the earth
cultivating the plants

the dew on the leaves

in the morning

the perspiration

dripping from peopleâ€™s brow
every where there was water
she saw and choose

what to tell and what

to keep to herself

like the tears

she all too frequently

sucked in
