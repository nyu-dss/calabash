by the river’s flow
for a long time

the other women
glanced her weary
hers was a gift

they did not envy

at the birth of her first child
she seemed to settle down
until one day

after drinking water

she flung the glass

that shattered into

tiny diamonded shards

miss tremblyn’s husband
dead tonight

she declared

and bright and early

the next morning

news of mister trembly’s passing
was whispered around

gradually

even grudgingly

they started

coming to her

bringing their own

cups cans and bottles
of water

didn’t matter if it

was from the spring

the river or the tap

if there was something
to see she saw and proclaimed

matriages deaths

betrayal financial disaster
even murder

until her head throbbed

and she covered her eyes

with apiece of black cloth

and wrapped her head with bay rum
but even then

ifone of her children

brought her water

if there was something

else to see she saw
