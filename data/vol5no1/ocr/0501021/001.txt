WATER WITCH

sometimes

she clasped her hands

to both cheeks

shook her head violently
and hollered out loud

ah not gwane tell them
ah not looking

me nah look

but everyone could see
her eyes were glued

to the water

her reflection

murky

the old women clicked their teeth
smiling said

poor thing

is seeing she is seeing

she didnâ€™t wash clothes
at the spot

where the other
women did

she went off a ways
and stripped

to her bra

and panties

sitting ona

large white rock
mesmerized
