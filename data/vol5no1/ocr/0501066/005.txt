So it is Pedro to whom Cecelia turns for advice and comfort — it is only Pedro to whom

she tells her dreams.

And today, Cecelia started her story, “first I was walking .. . just walking and walking.”

She described her dream and Pedro listened carefully, translating each detail in his mind.
And when she reached the end — the almost talking lizard — Pedro sat quiet. In long moments,
still, he bridged the gap between worlds and times. Pedro lives in a present filled with

yesterday’s ways and forgotten knowledge.

He began his instructions, “go and boil up some sage-bush, yes?”

Cecelia nodded.

“Then after it boil good-good, when yuh see the color change...take it off the fire and

then add-in some vertivier leaf. Bathe yourself good in that essence water,” Pedro said.

The herbs changed from one time to the next — lime bud, cousin majoe, shining bush
— sometimes they were added to bath water, sometimes they were steeped as tea, but always
they soothed Cecelia, grounded her. When she was a child, Pedro would make the baths
himself or steep the tea and hold the cup as she drank. As she got older he began guiding her —
standing over her as she pinched the leaves or stirred the water. Later he only instructed her,
and left her to work independently. And some months ago, he began asking her questions, that
led her to make her own decisions. “What lime bud does make yuh feel like? Yuh think de
chandelier-bush will go good wit’ what yuh see?” And so, on the last two or three occasions,
Cecelia had told Tio Pedro not just the details of the dream, but she had also told him what bath
she would prepare for herself, what leaves she would steep. And he had nodded and smiled,

and pulled down the flesh under his right eye.
