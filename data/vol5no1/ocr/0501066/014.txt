me more tie down to she, I want that. Just so.” And when Glen tells this story, Cecelia will

laugh and her eyes will look like the Old Man’s when Marjory talked about the shack.

For now, Cecelia plucks the ripest plums, savoring the sweet, juicy pulp. She tells
Glen about playing high in the hills under the stars. And Glen favors the tart green plums. He

talks about mornings on the beach and about the only meal his father ever cooked.

They talk of football and fruit, and of time and tides. © And Glen will get his truck out
of the mud, and he will drive off as two little boys imitate the truck’s engine, vroom. And
looking at the road ahead, he will see the rear view mirror in the corner of his eye. He will see
Cecelia standing with Pedro. Pedro with his ancient hand on his niece’s shoulder will be saying,

“don’ worry, he coming back soon. You go see him just now.”
