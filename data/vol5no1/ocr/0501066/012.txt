Glen, feeling Pedro’s eyes boring into him, believes he is being judged. Glen is wrong,
too. Pedro staring at Glen is not judging him. He is not really looking at Glen, as much as he

is looking at future. And looking at past. Looking at himself.

Pedro sees himself not though Glen’s eyes or through his own, but through Cecelia’s.
He knows that she is surprised to see him act like this with a stranger: gruff, closed, enigmatic.
Cecelia who knows Pedro better than anyone living today. But all that he knows, all that he
sees, is overridden by all that he feels. Washed away by the questions: how it is that my niece
get so big? So grownand ready to move on? How it is that I eh teach her everything I
supposed to? Is fail, I fail? The worry, the creeping loneliness, the sense of failure. He

excuses himself and walk into the other room.

Glen wonders what Pedro is doing in the other room. And when he suspects that Pedro
is eavesdropping, judging, he is wrong again. Glen won’t know that Pedro stands staring out
the window, tracing drops of rain as they fall from a single leaf at the end of a spindly, curved
branch. Watching water appear, bead, roll and fall. Again and again. Hundreds of times, an
action repeated on ever leaf on that pommerac treee. Repeated on every leaf of every tree in
this yard, under this rain cloud. Who but Pedro would see down to one drop at a time? Who

else but Pedro or Marjory? Who but the ancient or the dead?

And when the rain slows, and lets up. When the sun throws rays of light, instead of
droplets of water, on that solitary leaf. Pedro sees the light and the water on the leaf at the same
time. Recognizes that itis all together his now. The sunlight, the rain water, the leaf. The
baby with the caul, the girl coming home in tears from school, the woman with the yellow flower

in her hair. But Glen won’t know, when Pedro knows. Marjory knew it before.

And when Pedro returns, Cecelia and Glen are talking like before. And what Pedro
overhears, it Glen saying, “...used to say that the best part of her married life was when they were

living in a little shack.”
