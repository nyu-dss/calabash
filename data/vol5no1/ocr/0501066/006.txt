This morning though, he had carefully given the instructions — taken control again — and
Cecelia had been glad, because last night’s dream was not like any she had had before. Last

night she had been more of a participant, less an observer. Last night felt intensly personal.

“When you finish, put on white clothes. Only white, you hear?” This part was new.
“Make sure they don’ have no other color, yes. No little purple piping or red stripes or nothing
so.” Pedro pulled down the flesh under his nght eye — the familiar gesture that sealed
agreement between dreamer and knower. But this morning Cecelia thought she saw something

more in Tio’s eye.

Pedro watched his niece walk off to follow his directive, pondering all that the day would

bring her. Now, for the first time, Glen walks up to Pedro’s house.

Cecelia standing on the top of three steps, is ahead above Glen. She stares at him,
plainly, without guile. The separate features of his face — eyes, nose, lips — stand like hills
formed on a single orb of dark stone. But the hems of his green coveralls are splattered, and
he’s flustered by being lost and stuck and late. So all through his body there is the sense of

arrested motion, of indecision. He looks like a caught animal.

He stares at her. She’s nota pretty girl in any standard way — her eyes are
disproportionately large for her head, her ears too prominent. Lanky legs jut from her white
shorts. But her hair, plaited loose, forms a wavy frame around her face. Glen considers the
whole image — curve, color and light — and he remembers the day in art class when he was the
only boy who thought the Picasso portrait Mrs. Baptiste showed them was beautiful. He
remembers that hot Friday afternoon, remembers the way harsh angles blended into smooth arcs,
remembers wishing that he could see the real canvas, the way the paint lay onit. He
remembers not caring about the fatigue, the pointed teasing from his classmates — that is why

Moore eh have no girlfriend, he waiting fuh a choonks with two eye on the same side of she

head.
