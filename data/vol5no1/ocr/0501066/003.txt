brothers disapprove of Glen doing this job, driving a truck. Glen’s brothers take things too
literally, they still believe that the Old Man ferried them out to construction sites to prepare them
to run the business, to see the legacy up close. But Glen understands the more subtle meaning
and Glen also knows how to get his way. Years of dealing with the Catholic Brothers at
Presentation taught him — an offer to set up labs for Brother Timothy, got him out of the
unending announcements and off-key hymns of morning assembly; a spectacular goal during a
football match, saved him the extra practice laps. Glen is as clever as the Old Man, and as
tenacious as Marjory. So for the past year, he has been hauling bricks, pouring cement and
driving trucks — doing what he wants to — instead of working on a degree or at least training in

the office. Glen drives on through the rain.

At the top of the hill, as Cecelia’s uncle tucks a yellow orchid in her braid, the sun

regains its sovereignty over the sky — the shower ends just as quickly as it began.

Glen faces a fair sky, and a sudden memory — he is kite flying with the Old Man, sailing a
home-made “mad bull” way up high, and in a flash the wind drops, the string goes slack and
the kite plummets fast. Now, Saut D’Eau Road draws him further into the stepped, herb
gardens of this village. He drives, rocking in and out of rain-filled ruts, skirting muddy gutters.
When he tries to turn in a broad flat yard, the tires of his truck sink into soft mud, and he is stuck.

Glen is no longer on the planned route.

Two pre-school boys in the yard across the street stop their play to watch the giant toy.
Glen sits in the driver’s seat, knowing that trying to move the truck will only get it mired more
deeply. His hand lingers on the gearshift for a moment, and then he shifts to park and turns off
the ignition. The little boys try to make their young voices low like the engine as it turns over
and dies. Arrroogh. Glen steps out and mud rises past the heel of his boots, threatens the
hems of his coveralls. And when he walks toward the nearest house, the threat is made real and

dark mud splatters his legs.

“Well-well, that didn’t take long at all,” Tio Pedro says, watching from the kitchen

window.

Cecelia —dressed in white, with a flower in her hair — watches from the front stairs.
