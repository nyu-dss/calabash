Now, two little boys cross the street to examine the truck that to them is beautiful.

Pedro examines his niece and the stranger.

“Mister, what yuh watching me so for?” Cecelia flashes her teeth, playful. “Like yuh

expect me to move your truck for yuh.”

“Move my truck miss?” Glen joins in the game, quick. “What make you feel that right

there in that spot, 1s not exactly where I want that truck to be.”

“Oh-ho. You wake up this morning and decide to drive all the way up here, and park in

my Uncle yard?

“Nah, hear what happen, eh?” Glen places one booted foot on the first step, slips a hand
in his pocket. “I was going and spend the day by the beach, play some football and thing, but
this fella come and tell me that if I drive up here I could see the nicest woman in Trinidad.”

“Andis what? Yuh want me to help you look for she?”

“Nah, don’t try that trick, girl’ Glen says. “The fella tell me to find the girl with a

yellow flower in her hair.”

“Oh, well wait ‘til I see that man,” she says, “I tired tell him to stop sending just any and

everybody up here to me.”

“Well, in truth, people don’t usually call me ‘Anybody’, or “Everybody” for that matter,”

he says. “People does call me Glen.”

“Well right now, I think I should call you Muddy.”

“Alright you could call me that, but then don’ get vex when I make up a name for you.”

“Before you start calling people names, better remember you is the one with the truck

trap in the mud.”
