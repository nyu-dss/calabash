children at school whispered about as they stood apart from her. “Don’ get she vex, Pedro is

she uncle, he could.... My mother say don’ even talk to she, she family does...”

“The rain coming again,” Pedro says. His gaze not toward the sky, but aimed at Glen,

steady. “Don’ worry we go take care of you.”

Glen looks to Cecelia for help getting out of this compelling invitation, and realizes in
this instant that he’s already considering this girl-woman an ally. But before she can take a side,

before Glen can continue his protest, the rain does burst forth again.

“Yuh see,” Pedro says. “So just have some sitting down.”

Glen sits at the kitchen table with Cecelia. | Pedrostands. Hovers. His awareness of
what this day is for his niece does not calm him. Knowing does not mean accepting. Marjory

knows and Marjory is calm. Accepting is another luxury granted the dead.

“Mr. Moore, I know yuh eh used to country-bookie ways like ours,” Pedro says. “But

make yuhself comfortable.”

And as if to make that very instruction impossible, as if to scare away any hope of
comfort, Pedro goes on, “ I cyah understand how the driver of a fancy-fancy truck could end up

stick in my yard. Like you thief the truck? Or yuh thief yuh license? Which one?”

“Oh gosh Tio, yuh go frighten the man,” Cecelia says. Her eyes avoid Glen’s now,

even when she says, “don’ study him nah, he playing.”

Cecelia is wrong, Pedro is not just playing.
