“You never live in no shack, your hand too smooth, “ Cecelia says.

“T never live in the shack but I used to play in it all the time. That shack still standing

up. But when my mother used to say that — about how nice life was in the shack —

the Old Man used to stewps, suck his teeth and say ‘woman don’t talk foolishness’. But I

rainy seasons and dry seasons — Glen will tell the story. He will say, “I tell myself, what ‘stay
