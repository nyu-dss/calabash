other. The wooden walls are unpainted, decorated chiefly with scattered knot holes. The only
accessories are white: bleached cotton hangs from a clothes-line at the window; plastic, stamped
with a lace pattern, covers the table; and in one corner a trinity of partially burned, milky candles

have dripped waxy stalactites.

“Well Mr. Mendoza, sorry, I jus’. . .” Glen’s apology floats unfinished as he looks at
Pedro. Fora minute he tries to connect this face to the Cecelia’s. But Pedro’s firmly set
