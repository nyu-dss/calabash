will meet adults and children for whom gazing at sea or playing on sandy beach is an event —
because, even on an island the size of Trinidad, there is a world of difference between life on the

coast and life inland.

Glen’s mother is excited about this trip. Marjory Moore didn’t raise Glen as the baby of
the family, even though he is her youngest. Marjory, a woman who could find some
worthwhile trait in almost any stranger, found much to be celebrated in each of her children as

Nearly blinded by this rainfall, and unfamiliar with these roads, Glen winds his way up
The Saddle — where opposing slopes rise and fall like a calculus function. Maybe he should
stop, but the narrow road doesn’t leave much room for that, and Glen wants to get the truck to
the site as promised. The engine drones in a low gear, the wheels turn steadily. Glen hasa

point to prove. He fought hard to be driving, instead of marching to his brothers’ orders. His
