Last night Cecelia walked through the forest. She picked her way through thick mist
that hid the leaves that grazed her arms and legs. Chilled by moist air against her naked body,
she padded through wet dirt that forced its way between her toes at each step. One foot in front
of the other, unguided and unsure of any direction, she walked until a group of lizards moved
into her path. A dozen reptiles, a score — some long as a forearm, others pinkie-small, brown
ones and green ones, brown-and-green, rough and smooth — slithered in staggered, crooked lines,
forming patterns in the mud before her. Cecelia watched transfixed. She thought she
recognized some pattern, maybe a design, but always the creatures moved before she could fix

any image in her mind.

One mottled lizard broke away from the troupe and began a fluid crawl, moving closer
and closer to her. As she considered escape, the wet, white haze about her took on a new form.
Where, a moment before, Cecelia had seen the air billow and swirl as a single cloudy mass, she
now sensed dozens of separate darting movements: a cloud of pale yellow butterflies flew off in

every direction about her, moonlit wings soft against her skin.

The fluttering cleared and Cecelia looked down again. The rogue lizard had stopped
inches before her feet. It angled its head, its eyes met Cecelia’s, and it opened its mouth as

though about to speak.

First thing this morning, Cecelia went to Tio Pedro. Cecelia’s never known the concern
of a mother like Marjory, or even guiding wings of older siblings. Cecelia’s mother left a little
village, this village, running away from country-bookie ways and all the dusty
old-people-business that held her brother Pedro in place. Cecelia’s mother didn’t have her
brother’s interest or his sight. But in town, instead of modern office work and suitors with
sharply-creased trousers, Pedro’s sister found menial labor and sweaty married men who rushed
home to their wives. And when she found herself pregnant, she came back to this village, back
to her brother. She watched her brother between the groans of her labor, she watched him
afterward with the baby girl whose face was veiled in a bloody caul — watched him clean the
child and bury the caul and the navel string, following the old country-bookie ways. Watched
him in the days and weeks afterward, and had enough sight then to know that she wasn’t needed

again.
