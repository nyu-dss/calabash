The two stand playing and laughing for a while. The boys are playing around the truck,
feeling the heat of the engine, measuring themselves against the huge tires. The steel creature
is, to them, far more interesting than the timeworn banter between a young man and a young
woman. But Marjory is interested, she likes this girl who’s strong enough to make her son
work, funny enough to make him laugh. And Pedroisinterested. This is his niece, this is

future.

Pedro examines Glen’s height and size, the way he stands and how his eyes move when
he talks. Examines the way his niece responds. To unknowing eyes this would seem a casual
conversation. But Pedro sees brightness around his nieces face, sees how she seems to cleave
into Glen, how his body curves around hers. So Pedro, no casual observer, sees the changing,
the leaving. Present in this moment, Pedro breathes a fading past and sees a deepening future.

Pedro sees Pedro standing alone.

Pedro is not a selfish man. He spent his life tending to ways that have lost value,
worked nights with those who didn’t want him near — a lifetime misunderstood — and at this

stage he feels unready to let go, unprepared for this change.

So as much as Pedro considers Glen and Cecelia, he is considering himself — his own
fears and worries, the things he has done, things left undone. He looks at them now, and he
rehashes the past and contemplates the future. And if Cecelia were to look at him, just now,

she would see for certain that there is “something more” in his eyes. But she 1s still looking at

Glen.

I want to see him closer, Pedro thinks.

And Glen remembers that he is supposed to be at the construction site, not standing with

this girl-woman in a muddy yard in this small village.

“Yuh know, I was supposed to be in Santa Cruz ages ago,” Glen says.
