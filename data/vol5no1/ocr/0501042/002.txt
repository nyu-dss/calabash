and for the love of your parents.

The song writer ones, Dylan, Garfunkel and Simon,
Bob Marley and Tosh, Nas,

Joni, Janis, Chapman,

Tupac — I know you ain’t dead —

and all the rest: let them sing me home,

rap me home,

rock me home.

And I will join in from the grave
when Auden sounds the salute:
“Tomorrow for the young poets exploding like bombs!”
