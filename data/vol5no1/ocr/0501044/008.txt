mouth. She tasted their salt.
“Hello? Mrs. Walters? The gate was open.”
Fiona turned in the direction of the deep male voice coming from the front of the house. “Who’s
that?” She hauled herself out of the water and looked around. There was a tingling at the back of
her skull.
“Tt’s me...” The man appeared from the pathway at the side of the house.
Fiona grabbed the towel from the lounge chair. Her heart was thumping in her throat. “What do
you want?” She wrapped the towel around her so that it covered all but her knees and feet below.
Fiona’s eyes darted from the approaching man to the house.
“Don’t fret. I don’t bite, you know.” The man smiled.
Fiona felt like she did when she used to get high at college; the man’s words were those of a
faraway voice in her head, not of a flesh-and-blood person standing in front of her. “What?” she
said.
“Just a joke. ’m David Richards from Sunshine Disco.” He put his hand out.
Fiona spotted the heavy, gold chapparetta bracelet, shining against his dark skin. Slowly, she
gave him her hand.
Fiona looked at him steadily now. She connected the knowledge of her uncle’s sixtieth birthday
party with needing a disco and tried to regain her composure. “I’m Mrs. Walter’s niece, Fiona.”
She gave a half-smile and wiped a wayward lock of hair away from her face, anchoring it behind
her ear.
“My pleasure.” The man seemed to be studying her, rubbing his chin with his thumb and
forefinger. “Fiona,” he repeated. “I like that name.” He turned to look at the lawn beside the pool.
“Your aunt said I should come and look at the area where she’s going to have the party.”
“She’s not here. I'll have to get Andrea for you. I’m only visiting.” Fiona bent over to pick up
her sarong off the floor.
“You don’t need to do that. Pll wait.” He sat down on her lounge chair.
Fiona ran her fingers through her wet hair. She adjusted her towel, tucking the top end in, tighter
around her breasts.

“Where ’you from?”
“T’m Jamaican. But I live in Boston.” She rubbed one leg against the other. The water was
dripping down from her body and forming a sizeable puddle on the tiles.
“Then you’re a yardie.”

“Something like that.”
