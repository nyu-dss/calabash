happened? Fiona picked up her bags and began walking up the street.

“I’m going home,” she told her mother on the phone the next day.

“You are doing what?” Her mother’s emotion was so loud that she could have been standing
next to Fiona, instead of being miles away in the kitchen of their suburban house in Worcester.
“T have some leave, so I booked a flight on the 21st. Pll stay with Auntie Barbara.”

Fiona knew her mother would be pacing the floor, stretching the phone cord as far as the fridge,
and then allowing it to curl back towards the cradle on the opposite wall. “Didn’t you hear
about the woman they kidnapped last week? Or the Chang boy they murdered in Norbrook?”
“Tl be careful Mum, but I need to go. I don’t remember it so well anymore.”

There was a long pause. When her mother spoke again, she was calm and resolute. “That country
doesn’t want the likes of you, child. Not then, and not now. Don’t you dare fool yourself.”

Fiona had to bite down hard on her bottom lip to stifle the tears.

The plane door opened, and the passengers filed out slowly. Fiona stood briefly at the top of the
gangway, letting the sea breeze swirl through her wavy brown hair and the humidity settle on her

she dialled the airline’s number to cancel the ticket, and then, hung up.

Fiona inspected the terminal, which was at least double what she remembered it to be. At the
conveyor belt, she and the other passengers on her flight stood waiting for their luggage. She
kept looking around her, shifting her weight, and changing the position of her arms. It hadn’t
been so noticeable on the plane but now she realised what was different: she was the only white
person here other than the couple of American businessmen in the corner and the
Chinese-Jamaican pilot, leaning back against the baggage desk. She had forgotten what it was
like to be a minority, having lived in New England for so long and being accepted as a white
American, until she spoke. Her mother’s words echoed in her head, “One day the pot will boil
over, just look at Zimbabwe.”

Fiona saw Joy chatting to a young mother and her baby over by the trolleys and knew that Joy

must feel like the odd one out too—and, she thought, probably much worse, given the stories she
