began searching for her lipstick. She was tired of defending her right to her nationality, despite
her appearance, to Americans and worst of all, to other Jamaicans.
“Oh,” the old woman said quietly. She looked down into her lap at her dark, wrinkled hands and
began folding the handkerchief, she had taken earlier from her brassiere, into neat squares.
Fiona knew she had been unnecessarily short with the old woman. She glanced back at her and
tried to see her again for the first time. Her mahogany eyes, with their glaucoma grey pallor,
reminded her of those of a parrot fish she’d seen at the beach at Hellshire when she was a child.

and she stopped to look at the girl in a swimsuit riding bareback on a horse through the blue
Caribbean Sea: “Come to Jamaica and feel alright,” it said.

But now, in retrospect, Fiona knew it wasn’t just the promise of warmth and beauty that had
influenced her decision; after all, she had been programmed to be cynical about the island’s
advertising as a child of the seventies, whose middle-class parents were kept assured of their
decision to migrate by frantic phone calls from friends and relatives about the escalating crime
and corruption.

And, it wasn’t an attempt to forget about Jim, either. She had been running from him for some
