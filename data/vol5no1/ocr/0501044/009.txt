He got up and came towards her. Her chest tightened. She wanted to go inside now. She wished
her aunt or Andrea would appear.
“You think you could do me a favour and hold my tape?” He pulled out a measuring tape from
his shirt pocket and gave her the chrome end.

“So, you been out to any sessions or anything yet?” He was walking away from her, stretching
the yellow tape out, across the lawn.
“No, I plan just to take it easy this trip.” She knew what was coming next.
“Tt might be fun. I bet say an uptown girl like you, never flex with a man like me?”
All of a sudden, Fiona felt dizzy. She remembered how that man had grabbed her and shoved her
down onto the floor; how he had rested his weight on her flat chest, crushing her; how his rough
fingers had shoved their way down into her yellow skirt.

“So, wha’ you say, Fiona?” David was scribbling measurements on a piece of paper.
Fiona let go of the tape. It raced across the grass and snapped shut like a startled soldier crab in

David’s hand. Fiona strode toward the house and slammed the French doors behind her.

That night, Fiona dreamt of riding bareback through the sea on a chestnut horse with a white star
on its forehead. The horse was galloping, rising and dipping with the waves like a carousel horse
on a pole. With each movement, a hail of silver fish with opaque eyes jumped up, and over, the

horse’s mane. At one point, Fiona could see herself: her arms outstretched to the world. She was

completely naked with only a thread of yellow seashells laced through her wet hair.

The next morning it rained. Outside was like a charcoal drawing with the thick mist in its
varying hues of gray pencilled in around the house, and the hills beyond shaded in wide sweeps
of dull black powder. The sound kept Fiona in bed. Rain in Boston had always been different
from here, where the unrelenting water fell off the roof and pounded the ground, charting rivers
in the rich, dark earth. Her grandmother used to say it was God watering his plants with a bucket,
not a hose like in other countries. Fiona missed her grandmother, who had died a few years after
she and her parents had moved away. It was what she hated most about leaving, how her family
had been scattered like seeds across cities and countries to grow in different directions.

She tried to imagine what her grandmother would think of her now. No longer the fresh-faced
little girl whom she would squeeze tightly, for a moment, making them one. No longer spirited
and carefree, like the girl on the horse in her dream. Fiona hugged the pillow and faced the wall.

There was a knock on the door.
