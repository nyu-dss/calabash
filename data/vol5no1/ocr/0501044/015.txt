Fiona was amazed at how at ease David was with anyone he came into contact with.
“And who this nice girl, David?” Miss Cherry said, wiping her hands in her apron. She was a
stout Indian woman who smiled often and laughed loudly.
“My friend, Fiona. A yardie. She’s a cook too,” David answered.
Fiona smiled with Miss Cherry. “Your food is delicious. ..I can never make the pickle right,
when I’m up north.”
“Well, you must take some back.” She sent her nephew to the kitchen for a bottle of the orange
Scotch bonnet pepper and white onions soaking in vinegar. When Fiona offered to pay for it,
Miss Cherry refused. “It’s brawta my child, from one cook to the next.”
Fiona thanked her, and the couple turned back to their plastic plates full of fried snapper and
doughy festival.
“T used to love this, you see,” Fiona said.
“As a child?”
“My father always brought us here.” She dug her feet into the sand beneath the table and let the
cool grains slip between her toes.
“When did you leave?”
“9°79.”
“How come?”
“Oh, long story.” Fiona sipped her soda. “We had a break-in.”
“Well that’s one thing that unites all of us,” David said, and launched into a story about his
cousin’s family.
Back out on the beach, Fiona spotted a scrawny dun-coloured horse covered in old scars, being
ridden by a young man along the shoreline.
“What’s he doing?” She turned on her elbow to face David. She had finally removed her shorts
and blouse. At first, in her swimsuit, she’d felt insecure. God, ’'m so white, she thought. But
passers-by seemed not especially to notice her, the sun felt good on her body, and, gradually,
Fiona relaxed.

“He brings his horse out here and people pay him for rides. It’s sickening. They should put it
down.”
“That’s what made me come here,” she told him. “Although that isn’t quite the horse I
imagined.” Fiona described the poster to David and how it had made her want to come and see if
she could make amends.

“So, how you feel now?” he asked.
