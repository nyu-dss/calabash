had heard from her black Jamaican friends up there—in the lily-white neighbourhoods of Beacon
Hill and Back Bay. “You don’t know what it’s like Fiona,” Chantal had said to her once, when
Fiona and her had begun their uncomfortable, but inevitable, conversation about race and class
on the island. “When you walk into a store and the sales girls hover over you, watching you like

a hawk as if them think you could a never have a gold card in you purse.”

Fiona’s aunt and uncle were waiting by their car at the curb. She recognised them immediately,
even though it had been five years since her aunt’s last visit to Boston. Every year, the annual
photos were exchanged by her mother’s sisters and brothers. Her mother would put them on the
mantle above the glowing electric logs for the Christmas holidays, but then throw them out,
come January. Fiona imagined, though, that someone must keep them, compare each year
against the next: who had gotten fatter or taller, who looked happier or more miserable, who had
life treated better or worse.

Her aunt and uncle also stood out in the crowd of waiting relatives and friends because of the
striking image of her aunt’s petite body and pale skin against her uncle’s large, dark frame. He

“Hi sweetie,” Aunt Barbara said, breaking away from her husband and embracing her.

“Hey Auntie.” Fiona rested for a moment on her aunt’s shoulder and closed her eyes.

Abruptly, out of the shadows, a ragged man came up and offered to put the bags in the trunk.

“No, baby. Don’t give them nothing. Them too damn lazy,” her uncle replied, swinging Fiona’s
bags into the back of his SUV and slamming the door shut.

Fiona felt confused: why not take the help and give the beggar a few dollars? But she wasn’t sure
of herself, and put the incident down to the general suspicion Jamaicans held of each other,
which she had witnessed in her own parents and others, even in America. Fiona imagined that if
her uncle felt the beggar was unworthy and a ginnal, the beggar probably thought her uncle was
a sell out, a black busha, an uptowner with no care for the poor; accusations that both men could
probably refute with evidence to the contrary. Already, Fiona could see that such as conversation
would never happen, however, in this class-stricken country.

“Come honey,” her aunt said, ushering Fiona inside the vehicle. “Tell me about my sister.”

On the drive home, Fiona tried hard to focus on answering all of the questions about her parents,
