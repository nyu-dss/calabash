at the kitchen counter. “Sleep well?”

“Mmm,” Fiona lied.

Aunt Barbara stood and put her small handbag under her arm. “Listen, ’'m late for my meeting
with the caterers, but Andrea will get you whatever you need, okay?”

“Hello,” Fiona said to the plump woman by the sink whose short, straightened hair framed her
face. She looked old enough to be Fiona’s mother.

“Yes, Miss Fiona.”

Fiona was dressing in front of the mirror in her bedroom when she heard the noise and her
mother screaming. She didn’t know what to do. She ran to her door to lock it. One of the men
was already there. He looked at the young girl half-dressed in a pale yellow skirt, her nipples the
