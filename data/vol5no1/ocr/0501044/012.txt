they said that they didn’t think David was coming tonight.

Fiona went inside to change but decided to lie down for a few minutes. When she awoke, it was
past nine. She hurriedly got dressed and went outside and joined the sea of brown and black
faces dotted with a few white ones. Some of the guests seemed to know who she was, even
though Fiona didn’t recognise anyone. She ordered a glass of wine at the bar and felt the
lingering looks of a group of her uncle’s friends wash over her. She adjusted her black strapless
top and smoothed a fallen curl. She was taking a long sip of her drink when she heard David’s
voice behind her.

“Fresh meat, they call it.”

She turned to face him. “And what do you call them?”

“Sleazy, usually.”

“But no one’s ever called you that nght?” Fiona felt the anger surge inside her.

“No, but they have slammed the door on me a few times.” He rubbed the back of his neck.
“That’s not a surprise.”

“Yeah, I know,” he said, and took a gulp of his beer. “Listen, I’m sorry about yesterday, I didn’t
mean to offend you, it’s just I thought you might like to get out, see a different side of Jamaica,
while you’re here.”

She steadied herself by leaning back on the bar. He was right about that. Hadn’t she come back
to get reacquainted with this idea of a place she called home? Fiona watched David shaking
hands with a passing guest, the two of them sharing a joke. From this angle, Fiona could study
David and his long, perfectly curled eyelashes without being noticed.

When his friend walked away, David turned to face Fiona again. “So, like I was saying, have you
even been to the beach yet?”

“T don’t know you, David.” Fiona was being honest about how she felt, but she was also playing
with him now, enjoying the attention, and the control.

“Alright, I give up. But tell you what, see that old white man staring at you,” David said,
indicating across the party towards a short man with a moustache who kept glancing at Fiona. “I
give him 30 seconds to come over, and you, all night to get rid of him.”

She knew then, that this was the dare she had been unconsciously waiting for. “And, suppose I
prove you wrong?” she said.

“T'll take you to the beach tomorrow for the best fish you’ve ever had.” David turned and walked
back over to the turntable.

He was right. Within seconds, the man was standing beside Fiona, ordering a drink from the bar.
