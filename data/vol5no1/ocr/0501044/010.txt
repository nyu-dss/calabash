“Fiona, it’s me. Sorry, but it’s after eight and I need to go pick up some things for the party
tonight. You said you wanted to come.” Her aunt’s voice was soft and reassuring.

“Come in.” Fiona sat up in the bed, and pulled her large t-shirt over her knees. She watched her
aunt walk towards her. Her curly blond hair bounced with every movement of her head, and her
green eyes shone against her tanned skin. Her aunt’s sculpted arms reflected the thousands of
laps Fiona knew she’d swum in the pool over the years and, in adornment of that effort, several
diamond tennis bracelets dripped like raindrops from her wrists. Fiona pulled her own
dishevelled hair into a makeshift ponytail.

“Listen, I hear David came by yesterday. He’s a nice guy, we’ve known him for a while. I hope
you didn’t mind. I should’ve told you he was coming.” Aunt Barbara frowned, only now
showing her years. “When I came back last night, you were already asleep. Andrea told me that
you looked a bit upset after he left.”

“She said that? No, no, ’m fine.” Fiona focused on the floor, trying to hold back the tears.
Remember, you’re one of the lucky ones, she told herself. The men had panicked when they
heard the police car drive up. “Really, Iam.”

“You sure? Your mother said you're still a bit...”

“I’m going to get ready now, alright?” Fiona hopped off the bed and headed toward the
bathroom.

They left the house almost an hour later. The sun had come out, drawing back the curtain of
clouds and revealing green vistas all around the car. Billowing bamboo hung precariously off the
mountains in the valley, mounds of mango trees hovered in between. Banana plants staked the
sections which had been cleared for farming. The morning light shimmered off the guinea grass
like a silk dress covering the bulges of the hill.

Fiona dared occasionally to look down the precipice on this narrow road connecting Peter’s
Rock to Jack’s Hill, and then to the city below. She often met the eyes of children on the dirt
paths which led to their small houses, clinging to the hillside. The children would invariably be
barefoot: the boys wearing shorts only, and the girls, dresses, they’d outgrown. Sometimes they
would be carrying a bucket of water; other times, a younger sibling in their arms.

The car got to the junction with the main road. It was the first time in many years that Fiona was
seeing the city in daylight. She registered the neighbourhoods of white concrete houses capped
by their brown tile roofs; the shiny high-rises sticking out of the business districts like pointed
fingers; the grey thumbprint of smoke drifting over the city from the municipal dump; the airport

on the arm of land embracing the harbour. Only four more days to go, she thought.
