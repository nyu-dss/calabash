as well as on asking the appropriate ones about her aunt and uncle’s life. But she was distracted
by the sights outside the car: the dust billowing out of the cement factory; the soldiers on the
roadside holding their big, automatic guns; the children kicking stones under the streetlamp; the
vagrant lying by the overflowing garbage dumpster. And then, further uptown: the slick office
buildings and the American fast food outlets, the BMWs and Benzes, the billboards for private
security services, and the high walls of elaborate houses. And finally, the darkness of the
pot-holed road leading up to her aunt and uncle’s house in the hills, past the lean-to bars, and
landslides not yet fully cleared, to the imposing automatic gates of their property.

“Fiona, you okay?” Her aunt stood holding the car door open for her.

Fiona got out. “Just a little tired, I guess.”

In the middle of the night, Fiona sat up in the dark of the room coughing and reached for her
inhaler on the bedside table. What was she doing here? Why did she think it had gotten any
better? She didn’t even know if she wanted to be Jamaican anymore. She switched on the lamp
and looked around the guest bedroom at the heavy floral quilt, the pale pink carpeting, the
matching drapes and the faux gold fittings. It reminded her of the interiors of the brownstones on
Commonwealth Avenue back in Boston. Sometimes, if she got off early enough from work at
night and it wasn’t too cold, she would go and sit on a bench in the park that ran down the
avenue parallel to the elegant homes, and look through the windows. There would be a brass
tabletop lamp, a bushy houseplant to one side, some bookshelves in the background, a man
smoking a pipe in a brown leather arm chair and his wife making dinner, perhaps, in the kitchen.
Fiona would only stay a few minutes, and then catch the train back to her small apartment where
she slept on an old futon and shared a bathroom with a roommate.

Fiona looked up at the tray ceiling and her aunt’s fancy chandelier. She wondered if she would
have lived in a house like this if her parents had stayed. Fiona thought back to the first few years
in Boston when they lived with a cousin of her father’s; how her mother had worked as a
receptionist at a dentist’s office, while her father, who had left Jamaica as a bank manager, took
a job selling shoes at a department store. Her parents were comfortable enough now, but they
didn’t have a boat and a weekend house on the North Coast, and a gardener and maid, like her
aunt and uncle did. “Isn’t life funny,” her mother had said to Fiona recently. “Daddy cut Barbara
out of his will when she married Douglas—he used to say to Barb ‘your black hurry-come-up is

here’ when he saw him at the gate. And now Douglas has more money than Daddy ever had.”

“Well, there you are, I thought you were lost,” her aunt said. She was writing in her chequebook
