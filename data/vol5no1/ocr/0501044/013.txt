“You must be Barbie’s niece?” the man asked.

She glanced over at David, who was laughing at her. “Yes,” she said.

They shook hands, and he began asking her the perfunctory questions about her parents, her job
and her life in America—questions she would answer several times that night. She felt him
working up to asking her to dance. “Excuse me,” she said. “I think my aunt is calling me.”
Fiona spent the remainder of the night being shown off by her aunt and uncle, as though she was
the child they never had. They introduced her to their close friends and to distant relatives, whom
Fiona had forgotten; they mentioned her in their speeches; they made her cut the cake with them.
Every now and then, Fiona met David’s gaze. She felt relaxed for the first time since she had
arrived.

Later in the night, though, Fiona found herself alone on the outer edge of the party. She was
jarred by the sight of security guards and their dogs patrolling the perimeter of the property. In
that moment, she was transported back into the dark, under her bed, where she’d hid when the
man left. She had lay there, silent, facing the door. At first, she hadn’t responded to her mother’s
calls coming from the other side of the house. She had watched her mother’s bare feet approach
the bed. “Fiona! Fiona! Where are you?” her mother had screamed. “Dear God, they’ve taken
her! Someone please... help me!” Her mother dropped to her knees and held her head. “This
fucking country...” her mother had cursed. It was then that her mother had seen her child lying

in the darkness, hugging her knees to her bare chest.

“What you doing out here?” David asked. “I’ve been looking for you.”
Fiona was relieved to have David by her side this time.
“T played this just for you,” he said. Maxi Priest’s “Don’t Turn Around” was blasting from the
speakers. “Want to dance?”
“Funny,” she said, and started towards the dance floor.
“So, Hellshire tomorrow?” he asked.

“Yeah, alright then.” Fiona saw her aunt looking curiously at them and Fiona smiled at her.

The beach had more shacks selling food than Fiona had remembered from her childhood.
Walking by one, she could see a woman cooking fish in her large, make-shift wok of sizzling oil.
Out on the beach, a herd of goats traversed the sand, rummaging through the fish bones and
scraps, while small children chased each other in the shallows of the sea.

“Here, okay?” David said, motioning to a pair of wooden benches on stilts as tall as bar stools.
