review in the paper, but when they arrived Fiona immediately recognised all the markings of
mediocre food joint claiming Caribbean parentage: the red, green and yellow neon sign outside,
the Bob Marley posters and the flag above the order counter, floral vinyl tablecloths and small,
white China vases of silk flowers. They ordered the jerk chicken, but Jim wanted a salad which,
as Fiona had warned him, was a sad looking arrangement of shredded cabbage and carrots.
“What is this Fiona?” Jim said, poking his fork into the mound on his plate. “Aren’t Rastafarians
vegetarians? Shouldn’t they be able to at least make a real salad?”

Jim’s friend looked as if he was poised to tell his own Rastafarian-reggae music-weed
smoking-can you believe-story.

“She’s not a Rasta, Jim,” Fiona said quietly but firmly. What was she doing with this man? She
smiled apologetically at the waitress with her braided hair, who was looking at this American
white man from the counter like she was about to launch into a tirade of patois expletives. Fiona
was glad, at least, that they were the only customers in the restaurant.

“You could bring me some pepper sauce, please?” Fiona asked the waitress. Her mother’s urging

“No, you really don’t,” she said, and shook the sauce generously over her food.

Fiona rested her bags on the icy ground, folded her arms, and stood there shivering, still staring
at the girl in the poster. The girl sat upright, reins in one hand, her brown legs wrapping the
horse’s belly. She had a dreamy look in her eyes and small commas formed at the corners of her
mouth. She looked comfortable up there, but also a bit daring. Fiona thought that at any moment
she might spur on the horse and go galloping down the beach.

It was then, that Fiona recognised in herself an un-mined envy—a red-eye, her mother would call
it—that had been growing inside her since moving to America. It wasn’t the envy that was
expected of immigrants like her for an education, a decent job, and perhaps, in the future, a
leased car or even a house with a mortgage and shiny conveniences. Instead, it was an envy of
those who could have left the island, but had stayed and made a life for themselves. Was it

possible that she, too, could make peace with this place, after so many years, and all that had
