The benches were in front of a shack with a hand-painted sign that said, “Cherry’s Place.”
Fiona spread her towel and, taking her weight on the heels of her palms, hoisted herself up onto
the bench. She was still in her shorts and button-down blouse. David was already in his swim
shorts.
“You coming in?”
“Soon,” she said.
David jogged off into the water. Fiona was relieved to be alone for a few minutes. She had been
trying to think of a way out of coming to the beach today, since she’d agreed to it last night.
Must have been the wine, she thought. But now that she was here, Fiona was glad she had come.
The place was alive with people enjoying their day off, lying on the sand, swimming in the water,
drinking beer, eating fish. Fiona could hear the animated offerings of the vendors criss-crossing
the beachfront: “Peppa swimps!”; “Nuts! Wrigleys! Rizzlas!”; “Icicle and nutty buddy!”; “Red
Stripe! Guinness!”
Just then, one was by her side. His brown eyes were bloodshot, his jet black hair uncombed.
“Yow, Princess Di, I’ve some’ tin for you today, you know,” he said, shoving an open box of
sundry items at her.
“No thank you.” Fiona turned away to look for David in the sea. A fisherman’s boat named
“Give Thanks” had pulled up down the beach and David was among the crowd of prospective
buyers and curious children surrounding the boat to inspect the catch.
“Me really like you, you know... you well sexy,” the man said, grabbing his crotch.
“Get the fuck away from me!” Fiona jumped off the bench and headed toward David. She could
feel pure, crystal defiance, the colour of the nearby sea, fuelling each step.
At the water’s edge, Fiona sidled up to David, who was talking with the fisherman. David held a
shiny red snapper by its tail. Its flat, clear eyes were punctuated by black full-stops encircled by
what looked like silvery mercury.

“Look at those eyes,” she said.
“So you know about fish?”
“Yeah, I know.” She knew that you never eat barracuda caught in the full moon. That the roe of

a king fish was the sweetest. And that, no matter how beautiful a fish looked from the outside, if

its eyes were not clear it was either old or rotten.

David and Fiona ate on a wood-planked table inside Cherry’s Place. David had known Miss

Cherry for many years and, soon after they sat down, she came round front and hugged him.
