“Auntie, why didn’t you leave?”
“You mean in the ’70s?”
“Yes.”
“Tt was really your uncle who refused to leave...said he wasn’t going to any white man’s country
to be battered around.”
Like her own parents, Fiona thought. But she knew it was also that her aunt and uncle had
escaped unscathed, and that her uncle had cashed in on the fear of all those who had been scared
away by the ruling government’s socialist leanings; buying up property at fire sale prices from
those who'd left without warning, in the middle of the night, with US dollars stuffed in
concealed compartments of suitcases, in the bottom of their shoes, in their underwear, swearing
never to return.

“What about you Auntie?”
“T would’ve gone. I still would. This place gets stressful, you know.”
“How?” Nothing about her aunt’s lifestyle seemed stressful to Fiona. She didn’t have to work

him entranced, laughing and egging him on. When the music was turned up, he started a congo
line and pulled Fiona behind him. She protested at first, but gave in when he placed her hands
firmly on his waist. They ended up dancing past midnight around a bonfire, the sparks shooting

up like the firefly peenywallies of her Jamaican childhood, lighting up the moonless sky.

Fiona and her aunt were late coming home. The car was full of baskets of flower arrangements to
be placed on the tables. Fiona grabbed a few and set off down the lawn. The place was buzzing
with preparations. Some guys with Sunshine Sound written on their t-shirts were connecting the
wires to the huge speakers. Fiona found herself looking for David. Maybe she shouldn’t have
