“T don’t know. There’s so much beauty in this place and in the people, but there’s also so much
about it that troubles me too...that I can’t just accept now.”

“Why would you have to?”

“T guess.” She lay down flat on her back and cupped her hands over her eyes to shield herself
from the sun. “You ever think of leaving?”

David shrugged. “My uncle could file for me. And yeah, sure it’s tough, more so for others, than
for me...but this, this is home, girl.”

She sat up again and looked at him. He was watching some children jumping the choppy waves

as they folded over at the shore. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky, it was a beautiful day.

Fiona looked out through the window of her uncle’s car. She had always liked this part of the
drive to Ocho Rios, down through the quiet, pastoral scenes of Claremont. Fiona was thinking
about yesterday, and how gently David had kissed her on her cheek when he dropped her back to
her aunt’s house. But Fiona had made up her mind not to try to hold onto him, to box up what
they had and take it home with her, like a tourist would a smooth, pink conch shell.
“Later, then,” Fiona had said, getting out of David’s car.

“Yes, my girl, later.”
In truth, she wasn’t sure when she would be back, but at least she felt she had stitched together a
freedom, which she’d not felt before, to come and go. For now, she was looking forward to

going back to Boston, to seeing her parents and friends again.

They were passing through the tiny district of Chalky Hill. The terrain had become more uneven
with sudden drops down into tree-filled valleys. They passed some of the old-fashioned wattle
and daub homes. One had a bauxite-red zinc roof and white doily fretwork in which Fiona
spotted an old lady sitting in a rocking chair on the front veranda. She thought about her own self
there, in thirty or forty years, rocking away, happy to watch the world pass by.

The car sped on and rounded a bend. “Look, Fiona,” her aunt said, pointing at the first sight of
blue since leaving Kingston. “The sea.”

The North Coast laid itself out across a hundred and eighty degrees like an open fan. The land
rushed down under the crumbling colonial stonewalls and modern barbed-wire fences, across
acres of sugar cane fields, roads and houses, to the blue pen line of the sea’s edge. From there,
the sea unfurled its shades of lapis and indigo until it touched the ruffled hemline of the hazy

horizon.
