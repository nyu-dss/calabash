If you run into a field,
the wind blowing in your ears
one late afternoon

what to do
what to do

Your magic waning, the ground
beneath you shaking

what to do
what to do

A jet pinned for a minute
to the sky, a wide, wide
smile in the arc of a bird

swinging down, down
and bye
what to do
what to do

GOOD-BYE
