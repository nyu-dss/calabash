Selby threw herself even more deeply into her work, determined to be made a partner in the

attended all the major events on the social calendar. If either one noticed the absence of any real
emotional involvement, neither one mentioned it. There was no time, no need for introspection.
Occasionally, when a colleague celebrated the birthday of a child, Richard would remark in
Selby’s presence, that they were both wedded to their work, that children were not important to
them. He said it with a smile, defying any contradiction, and they both agreed that children
would not allow them the lifestyle that they enjoyed. At other times, when friends visited and
commented on the elegance and quiet of their home, he would joke “That’s why our marriage
works. It’s because we have no children.”

The words cut deep, searing her very soul, but in time, Selby learned to ignore the pitying

glances and laughed along with him. They had found a way to survive.
