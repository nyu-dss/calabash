me back home, along with all the children who lived near our house. Most times we competed
for the bag of sweets which he always carried and would distribute readily, once we could
answer his questions about our school work. Years later, I discovered that he himself was
illiterate, yet he could always tell when the answer was incorrect.

Then of course there was the protection that he provided when we were passing the cotton
tree. Mannis said that it was over 100 years old. It was an enormous tree, with a trunk that was
solid and thick like the trucks that transported the sugar to and from the factory. At times, the
branches spread out dark and impenetrable, extending all the way across the road, casting
murky-looking shadows on to the ground.

We children would become increasingly quiet as we approached that section of the road.
Mannis had warned that duppies lived at the foot of the cotton tree. “Always bite you finger and
count one, two, out loud when you _passin’,” he hissed. “Duppy can’t count pas’ three, so they
will stand there waiting for the ‘three’ and that will give you a chance to run and get way from
them.”

“After two: one, two!” he would shout. And we would run as one, determined not to be the
one to be caught by the cotton tree duppy.

Once Teacher Rockwell passed as we were running by, and told my mother what we were
doing. She had scolded Mannis roundly, embarrassed that he should hold her up to such public
ridicule. “You think ah sending the child to school for you to be filling up her head with
foolishness?” she fussed. Behind her back, he winked at me, and we shared a smile. She

doesn’t understand, we agreed silently.
