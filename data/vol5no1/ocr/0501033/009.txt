Nathan was increasingly fretful. He had suffered through the heat but now the rain seemed
to be saturating his body, evidenced by the mucus that streamed incessantly from his nostrils.
When he developed a cough, Richard insisted that they take him to the hospital. “No
temperature. It’s just a cold,” the doctor told them. “It’s normal at this time of year.” He
prescribed cough syrup and antibiotics. Behind their backs, he exchanged a smile with the nurse.

New parents! He dealt with them all the time.

By Christmas, life had returned to normal and we decided to spend some time with Mannis
and my parents in the country. Richard had negotiated a good deal with his business partners in
Miami and called to say he would return home early to celebrate. My case was scheduled to end
on the Tuesday before the holidays and we agreed that we would leave that same afternoon, so
that we would arrive at my parent’s house in time to put up the tree before Christmas Eve. I
finished packing late Monday night then looked in on Nathan, hoping he would sleep long
enough the next morning to allow me time to review my notes thoroughly before going off to
court.

I was up by daybreak. From the doorway, I could see that Nathan was fast asleep. If he
slept for another hour or so, I thought, I would have time to complete my final arguments. Some
time later, the shrill sound of the telephone interrupted my thoughts, and I glanced at the clock,
amazed at how much time had elapsed. I raced over to the phone. It was Richard. He had
taken a taxi and so I wouldn’t need to pick him up from the airport.

“How’s Nathan?” he asked.
