We had been married for five years when I became pregnant for the first time. We hadn’t
really planned it that way. I was busy establishing my law practice and Richard’s consultancy
was really taking off. There just didn’t seem to be the time. As luck would have it, the pregnancy
was uneventful so I was able to work right up until the time that Nathan was born. He was a
delight - a cheerful baby who gurgled happily whenever anyone came into focus.

I returned to work when he was six months old, despite Richard’s objections.

“It’s not as if you have to work,” he said.

“Richard! I love what I do, remember?”

“More than your son?”

“That’s not fair. You’re still working, aren’t you?

“That’s different.”

The September that Nathan turned three, he caught two colds in quick succession. The
months of July and August had been particularly hot, with temperatures reaching into the high
nineties. The slight breeze that surfaced every now and again only made the situation worse, like
a fan circulating hot air in a closed and windowless room.

Everywhere that Selby went, conversations turned inevitably to the heat, until she felt like
screaming to the skies to let loose some rain, a hurricane even, anything that would cool things
down and give people something else to talk about. In response, September dawned dank and
dreary. Soon, it began to rain, a steady, unrelenting downpour that refused to let up, drenching

everything, fraying nerves.
