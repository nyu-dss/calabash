mother had insisted that he attend a play being put on by one of her charities. Richard had agreed
reluctantly, prepared to be bored. As they entered the theatre, he had heard a woman laugh, a
deep throated infectious sound that soared above the chatter. It turned out that she was a friend
of the playwright’s daughter and had been away in England. She was home for the holidays but
would return at the end of the summer to finish up her law degree.

“So will you sue me when you graduate?” he had asked facetiously.

“Well that tie is definitely a crime,” she had laughed. “Hi, I’m Selby Whittaker.”

She was wearing blue: an off- the- shoulder blouse that emphasized her long, slender neck
and the smooth, chocolate brown of her shoulders. Her calf length skirt swirled as she walked,
emphasizing long, elegant legs. Richard tried to think of something else witty to say, but failed.
She laughed again, fully aware of the effect she was having.

He had pursued her with a determination that had surprised even him. He found himself
making excuses to call her at odd moments every day. He delighted in the sound of her voice,
her laughter. They talked for hours on end, days passing into weeks as the summer sped by.
We're made for each other,” he said, reaching over, caressing the dimple on her cheek.

“Get over it! It’s summer, Richard,” she laughed derisively. “I have another two years. I
can’t focus on that now.”

“Timing means nothing. Marry me when you’re through,” he said, arms outstretched, as she
caught the plane back to England.

“Oh! Richard! You are such a romantic!”

He smiled. “So you’l] marry me?”
