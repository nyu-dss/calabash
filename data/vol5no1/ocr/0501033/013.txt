A flicker of irritation crossed Selby’s face.

Richard took a deep breath. We used to love each other, he thought.

“Tm tired, Richard. It’s been a long day.”

“T can imagine.”

“How did you get in? I thought I had taken back the keys?”

He ignored the comment. “So how was the service?”

In times past, this would have been the cue for him to reach out and hold her close. She
would have been hesitant at first. It was almost as if she feared that putting her thoughts into
words would somehow prevent her from savouring the event to the fullest.

Richard had learned to wait. He would continue to hold her, stroking her shoulders slowly
until she was perfectly relaxed. Then the words would come tumbling out as she described what
had happened: the people, the setting, and her impressions of the event. Richard had loved those
moments. Selby was an excellent raconteur and by the time she finished, oftentimes he would be
rolling with laughter. Afterwards, her mood would change and it would be her turn to draw
him close. The lovemaking then was phenomenal. What happened to us?

“So what do you want?” Selby started across the room. Her heel snagged on a crease in the
carpet and she stumbled. Instinctively, Richard reached out and caught her hand. Their eyes met.
Selby pulled away sharply. Richard could see that she, too, remembered. For a brief moment he
toyed with a fantasy of pulling her down to the floor and his heart quickened in anticipation. He
glanced across at Selby but her expression was cold. It reminded him of the purpose of the visit.

“What is it?”

“T want a divorce.”
