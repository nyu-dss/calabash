1695 at the age of 15. This tomb is erected by her disconsolate mother and relatives.

An overwhelming sense of sadness engulfed my entire body. I felt a sense of kinship with that
disconsolate mother. Had grief been any different in the seventeenth century, I wondered. How
had she coped with the death of a child?

I realized that I had played among these graves, unappreciative of the chronicles of life
revealed by the inscriptions. For me, the graves had been nothing more than a backdrop to the
games we children played as we waited for services to begin or, a resting place as we waited
after church for our mothers to finish their conversations so we could begin the long walk home.
On Good Fridays, as pastor lead the congregation through the stages of the Cross during the

Mannis had been aghast the first time he saw us jumping over the graves. Normally, he
didn’t attend the Good Friday services, but for some reason that year, he had decided that he

The church began to fill up as people arrived for the service. The whispering was deafening.

I could see members of the congregation jostling to view the casket which had been placed just
