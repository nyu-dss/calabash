and the undertakers had skillfully positioned his body inside the coffin so that the rest of him was
barely visible. Still, they crowded around the casket, some casting furtive, accusatory glances in
my direction, others averting their eyes as they passed, pretending that they didn’t want to view
the remains. I knew better though. Nothing as exciting as this had happened in the village in
years!

“Is who find him?”

“Nuh the daughter. Mi hear say she find him tie to the coconut tree at the back of the yard.”

“Then nobody never see him?”

“Tie up and douse himself with kerosene. Burn up till him skin crackle! Is the grace of God
that the house itself never burn down.”

“Is because him is an Indian, you know. Mi hear say them don’t wait to dead. As soon as
them reach a certain age, them just burn up themself.”

“Them shoulda watch him.”

“Nobody never expect it, especially like how him live in this country so long.”

“Shhhh! See she a come!”

The whispering stopped as I approached, replaced by appropriate expressions of grief.

“Good afternoon, Selby. Remember me? I’m so sorry to hear about your grandfather.
Mannis was so good to all of us.”

Old hypocrites! | dismissed the thought as quickly as it had appeared. In truth, some of
them had gone to school with me. I had no doubt that in their own way they, too, shared in my
grief. Yet I said a silent prayer as I looked at their faces, proof positive of what I might have
become, if I, too, had remained in the village. I nodded in acknowledgement and swept past the

group, determined that they would not see me cry.
