THE ART OF COLLABORATON:
AN INTERVIEW WITH KWAME DAWES

SASY ROSS:  There’s a vibrant history of collaboration among writers and artists from
the Caribbean. Derek Walcott worked with Paul Simon on the musical, Zhe Capeman. Michael
Gilkes and Kamau Brathwaite collaborated on film productions of Sun Poem and Mother Poem.
Brathwaite was always engaged with using music--especially Rasta drumming and pocomania
drumming as part of his performances. No doubt others did the same during the seventies and
eighties and continue to do that now in the jazz vein. Sistren Collective was closely associated
with the School of Drama in Jamaica during that time period. My sense is that they worked
with Blacka Ellis, Tomlin Ellis and the cadre of dub poets who were working at the time. Opal
Palmer Adisa founded the performance duo, Daughters of Yam, with Devorah Major, with who
she also published a two-poet anthology. Still, no one has the long and interesting track record
of Kwame Dawes. There’s Brimming, a chapbook, which was presented not only as a live
performance with musicians, dancers, singers and readers, but also as an art exhibit with the
painter, Brian Rutenberg, whose art inspired the poems. There’s Bruised Totems, a collection
of poems based on the African Art in the Bareiss African Art collection, which also included
images. Wisteria: Twilight Songs from the Swamp Country, performed live at the Poetry
International Festival. 7 Saw Your Face and Requiem, based on the art of Tom Feelings. So, I

collaboration part of the literary scene at the time or did it proceed from your personal
inclinations?

KWAME DAWES: I was a thirteen year old in high school when Dennis Scott was a
teacher there. This was at Jamaica College in Kingston--a school that had an elitist history, but
that, by the time I was there in the early seventies--the era of "free education” had become a
public school with a wider cross section of people from all economic backgrounds. Scott, a
poet and noted theatre director, introduced my second form class to a project that still remains a
