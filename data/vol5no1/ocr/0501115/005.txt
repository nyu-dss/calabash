artists who created these works as they were all long dead. But a dialogue between art forms
was taking place. Some years ago the Columbia Museum of Art had an exhibit of Urhobo
artwork from the Urhobo tribe in Nigeria. They invited me to respond to the artwork. I did.
While doing so I discovered that this tribe was one that my grandfather lived among when he
served as a missionary in Nigeria for almost two decades at the turn of the 20th century. It was
a wonderful connection to make and to write poems about. The performance of these poems
was then organized with a local jazz musician who improvised as I performed the poems. We
rehearsed briefly and pointed to mood signatures and cues, and then simply improvised in our
performance--song, poetry and the keyboard and saxophone. It was a strong performance and a
deeply collaborative one--at least in terms of the performance of music and poetry. Wisteria
worked in a different way. Much like Requiem, it began with the poems, but the poems were
based on interviews I conducted with African American women in Sumter. I then gave the
poems to a musician and composer, Kevin Simmonds, who set the pieces to music. We then
worked together to design the full production of voice, song, and instrumentation. The
inclusion of the photographs by Robert Johnson came afterwards. This was an idea that Kevin
Simmonds had and that completed the collaborative process on one level. Kevin Simmonds
worked with his musicians in a collaborative manner and I did the same with some of the
readers/singers. The work has continued to grow in this way. Brimming, another
collaborative work, began as a commissioned piece. My task was to respond to an exhibition of
the art of Brian Rutenberg, a New York based South Carolinian painter. I wrote a series of
poems after viewing his work and reading about his process and his biography. The
performance of the poems was then done as a staged work with dancers and a cellist. I directed
the piece and did not read in the production. Brimming has had several performances. The
artwork of Rutenberg is emblazoned on a screen as the poems are read. These are all
collaborative efforts that come from different places, but they can be far more integrated in their
collaborative process. I suspect that this will happen.

SASSY: Is the writing itself ever collaborative or is it the performance of the writing?

DAWES: My writing is often collaborative but I have not yet published or performed
work that has been done collaboratively. And here I mean poetry. I have always regarded the
work I have done with musicians (during my years in the band) and with theatre folks (during
my years in theatre) as collaborative even in the writing. Often I am relied upon to generate
text, but once the staging or rehearsing begins, I am constantly looking for help with language,
with the form and with the structure of the work. In these collaborative arrangements, I find
that there has to be some clear line about what roles each person has. My other more
collaborative writing exercises have included multiple Renga writing projects with writers from
all over. Often I treat the Renga as an opportunity to mentor newer writers, and also as a
chance to be in dialogue with my peers. These are pure collaborations that generate rich work.
I think I have completed almost a hundred of these over time. I have also worked closely with
an Indian poet, Sudeep Sen, on a series of "letter-poems" between us which have appeared in
