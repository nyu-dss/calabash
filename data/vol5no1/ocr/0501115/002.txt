source of amazement to me. He had apparently decided to set some poems to performance,
with music, movement and a lot of chanting (which worked well for boys) for a staging that as
far as I can recall, did not have an audience, but simply had the reward of our going on a field
trip to the Jamaica School of Drama, with its avant garde architecture--open spaces,
a-symmetrical angles for the large concrete facades and a lot of levels set against a thickly
bushed backdrop--there were no real doors, just sliding panels that allowed one to have the
sensation of being constantly outdoors even when indoors. In retrospect, I suspect that Scott
was just trying to get us to record on tape our performance for his use in a larger production that
he may have been working on in the theatre. Whatever the reason, I remember being impressed
by the slow, some chaotic, but always deliberate process of working with our voices, with song,
with drumming, and with TEXT. All from text. Scott would help us understand the text and
then use this understanding to guide what new innovation he would have come up for the class.
We would try it and he would shape it until it was working well. This may have been my first
experience with collaborative work, even if I did not understand what I was doing. I do know
that I found the process exciting.

SASSY: How did you move from theatre into the literary world?

DAWES: Theatre was my entry into the literary world. I began to write plays and be
involved with theatrical productions when I was eighteen and an undergraduate at the University
of the West Indies. Because I was working with a Christian group, and because our mandate
was largely evangelical (even as we theorized that in the tradition of Medieval and Renaissance
Drama and poetry of 17th century Britain, great art could come the business of "preaching") all
the work we did was original. That plays existed were simplistic church plays that
demonstrated no understanding of theatre to speak of and lacked sophistication of character, plot
or staging potential. So I began writing for the stage and writing with a very clear sense of the
company of actors, musicians, directors, designers and producers I was working with. This may
have begun my process of collaboration. Beginning with my word, I was working closely with
other artists to create something remarkable. My first play, "In the Warmth of the Cold", was a
musical and I collaborated with an Antiguan musician, Oswald Zachariah, to put the show
together. The experience was a defining one to me and I was impressed by the pull and push
and the give and take of collaboration, but mostly by the way in which the skills of someone else,
when merged with your own skills, can produce something beautiful and decidedly new. I
don't think that this 1s a peculiarly Caribbean thing. I think that anyone who begins in theatre and
spends time acting, directing, composing and building sets, will start to see the artistic process as
fiercely independent and self-centered, and at the same time, profoundly collaborative. I have,
since, always sought to work with others on my projects.

SASSY: Was there a number of projects that involved the adaptation of poetry and
fiction of Caribbean writers for stage or film during those early years in the theatre?

DAWES: I was constantly impressed by a number of projects. I remember seeing
Michael Gilke's treatment of Kamau Brathwaite's Mother Poem and being impressed by the
