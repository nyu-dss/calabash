commissioned. I have been deeply involved in the project all the way through and they have
checked me for approval and for more text and so on. I wrote all of the text on the site. They
have been good about that. I wrote a lot of words. Over forty thousand words of prose, along
with the poetry and this has been the source. I still find it inadequate. Sometimes I don't even
feel as if the poems have done what they should do, but I always feel that way.

SASSY: I know that youâ€™ve alluded to some of the challenges of realizing this project,
including the hang-ups of the team that you were working with, particularly their assumptions
about the Caribbean and about poverty, but did you have any personal concerns that you had to
grapple with dealing with such a sensitive subject matter?

DAWES: I did quarrel with the crew, and we did go back and forth about some things,
but I have to say that they were open and very generous and ultimately, understood what I was
dealing with and what I was trying to communicate. I also struggled with my personal concerns
about HIV/AIDS--the fear of the disease--not in that paranoia sense of getting it from touching
someone or anything like that, but its implications to my life. I was hearing stories that were
frightening for their ordinariness. And this is part of what feeds the poems. I was emotionally
drained after each trip, listening to hours and hours of stories of struggle and resilience and hope.
I was. What is in the site and in the articles is such a small fraction of what was experienced
and heard and the hundreds of hours spent working on this thing. So that was a strain. It was
all worth it, though, and I was moved by the openness of the folks who were willing to talk to
me.

SASSY: Have you shared the project with the people whose stories and portraits are
included on the website?

DAWES: Not yet. This was an issue forme. I did promise a few people that if I used
their words and quoted them directly, I would let them see the context in which that was done
before it was published. As it happens, no one quoted fell into that category. I promised
everyone that there would be an event in Kingston in April for the Jamaican launch of the site
and there people would get to see the whole thing in a safe environment. That is in the works.
One of the longer poems was read at an HIV/AIDS benefit event during the Christmas by folks
from the Jamaica AIDS Support for Life Office. The poem was dedicated to the key people
from Portmore, and they really were moved by the poem. I was not there. The whole project
had to find a balance between straight journalism and something more lyrical and personal, and I
struggled to explain to the journalist in my collaborators that I wanted greater sensitivity to the
lives of the people in the "story." I think the message came across. And that means a lot to me.
