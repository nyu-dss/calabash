possibilities there. At the time, I was impressed with the work as a theatrical piece--and I saw it
as a great opportunity for theatre. I also remember reading Kamau Brathwaite's Zhe Arrivants
and being struck by the theatricality of the work, its readability and its intent on being a
performance work with multiple voices, with music and with movement. It is all built into the
piece. I am actually surprised that no one has staged a full-blown performance of this work.
It is desperately needed. The sound track is already built into the piece, and the voices are well
laid out. Brathwaite claims to have spoken the whole poem onto tape before transcribing it into
written form. Iam not entirely convinced by this claim, but to doubt it is quite churlish. I do
believe, however, that the work, with its performative superstructure, has been a tremendous
influence on me--pushing me to think comfortably about the book length poem of epic scope and
work that is rooted in musicality, above everything else. Since then, I have been equally
impressed by work by Derek Walcott and Lorna Goodison--to name just two--in this vein. But
The Arrivants is defining for me. But equally defining, and perhaps more defining in practical
terms, is the work of Ntosake Shange, whose choreopoem, "for colored girls who have
considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf...” I discovered in the University of the West Indies
library in 1981. I was in search of anything labeled poetry by women in a desperate attempt to
immerse myself in the feminine poetic voice as I prepared to write a play with an all female cast
("Charity's Come"). I had serious doubts that I could capture the voice of women in credible
ways, especially since I knew I was writing a verse play. I read a lot of poetry by women, but
when I found Shange's book, I was beside myself with excitement--I wanted to read ahead and
yet I was afraid that to read more would lead to disappointment. It was a strange kind of
excitement. The work is simply brilliant, but I mention it here, because what it gave me was
this model for the single poetic voice to be then shaped into a theatrical piece. Shange says she
wrote the choreopoem as one long monologue--a lyric poem, even. Then she began to work on
it for the stage with collaborators and started to find that multiple voices resided there even as
they were all her voice at some level. I never saw that play until many years later, but I did not
need to. I still have it riveted in my mind as one of the most important works for me as a
playwright, and, more to the point, as a writer who believes that the poem can have a presence on
the stage that is theatrical, powerful and ultimately its own thing. Shange'’s work is perhaps the
seed for all the collaborative work I have done since.

SASSY: Considering the varying nature of your collaborations, which involve not only
text but painting and music, would you say that you’re equally inspired by what you see on the
page as what you see on a canvas or hear in a record?

DAWES: As a writer I am always engaged in the work of other artists in various
disciplines, and I can safely say that much of my work is prompted by what I see being
performed on the page, on canvass, with music and so on. I have program notes for plays,
recitals and poetry readings that are festooned with my handwriting--poems, stretches of
theatrical dialogue, passages of prose, sketches, and much else that have been prompted by what
Ihave seen. Often I am not writing to describe what I have seen, but trying to voice what the
