in my sensibility, but they have been pushed forward and fired by the plays. I have written
poems that respond to music, to art, to other narratives and these are all part of the process of
stirring the creative instincts. So in many ways, the initial creative impetus is decidedly rooted
in the desire to write poems, to tell stories or capture moments through the process of language.
There is then a secondary impulse related to the movement towards performance, which comes
from the pleasure of watching others create, and create in response to my work. Often, these
responses, especially when they are musical, tend to help me reshape my work and to see them
work in quite different and often helpful ways. Ihave changed lines in poems and cut out lines
of other poems in response to what I have seen a musician do with the poem. I relish that kind
of dialogue. Finally, because I know that music has such a powerful impact on me, I like to
share the full force of a poem--its inspiration and shaping--with readers and listeners, and that is
part of what draws me to the collaborative act.

SASSY: â€” Tell us about your latest project?

DAWES: The new project is called Hope. Like the other projects, Hope has grown out
of a commission. I was invited by the Virginia Quarterly review to write a full-length article on
HIV/AIDS in Jamaica. I mentioned that I would be interested in writing poems as a way of
processing the experience of meeting with and talking to people in Jamaica who are living with
HIV/AIDS. So for several months I wrote poems. The project was funded and produced in
partnership with the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting--a media outfit in DC. They became
quite interested in the poems, feeling that they could use the poetry as the basis for an elaborate
and sophisticated web treatment of the HIV/AIDS reporting I was doing. Soon, our discussions
began to revolve about the ways to really "present" these poems, and I suggested that working
with a composer might be a good way to go, which could eventually lead to some kind of
performance. This is how Kevin Simmonds was pulled into the project. He set the poems to
music and designed a performance. At the same time, still photographers and web-designers
started to work with the poems to begin a series of images around the issue in Jamaica. The
final performance will take place on the website and on stage. The images, the songs, the
poems will all feed into the final production which is fairly advanced. The music has been
recorded. The same team that put together and performed Wisteria is performing in this piece.
Hope will be staged in Jamaica, in Mexico, and in various parts of the US. Again, these are
collaborations with rich possibilities.

SASSY: How did this go from a commission to write a 10,000 word essay to the
interactive website, LiveHopeLove.com?

DAWES: The Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting joined with the VQR to talk about
ways to expand the project and I was invited to DC a few times to plot this. The interactive
website is part of the work they do and they have done similar work on Haiti and on other issues
in different parts of the world. This was their most ambitious and the first to involve poetry and
music and so on. And the idea to incorporate music came from a suggestion I gave them to
look at Wisteria. They liked it a lot and wanted to have the treatment, so Kevin Simmonds was
