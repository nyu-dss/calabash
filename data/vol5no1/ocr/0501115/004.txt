work is stirring in me which may have very little to do with the subject of the piece I am looking
at. I have long known that art has been a tremendous source of metaphor and image for me.
Specifically, when I was writing the poems for Midland, I remember going out of my way to
purchase books of art by Caribbean artists, and then other classical artists like Van Gogh, to feed
me images that I could write against and with. This kind of collaboration is quite private and
may have little apparent presence in the poems unless I indicate this in notes for a book. When,
for instance, I first encountered Tom Feelingsâ€™ book, Middle Passage: Black Cargo/ White Ships,
I was floored by the power of the images. I really was. By the time I was finished going
through the book several times, I think I knew that there was at least one poem buried there.
But my first impulse was to write to Tom Feelings to thank him for the book. I did not know him
at the time. The letter began, Dear Tom Feelings, and then the line broke. It was the first
poem in a series of poems that essentially became my letter to him. When I had finished the
letter of poems, I sent the thing to him and I was, in many ways, done. I had gone from image
to image and responded to these images in verse. Tom was not a conscious collaborator with
me in this instance, but his work had fed me the images and emotion to which I could respond in
poetry. Some months later, my publishers wondered if I had any slave poems as the BBC was
interested in airing some work about slavery. I sent the poems to him. The BBC changed
their mind, but my publishers wanted to publish the poems as a unit. And this is how Requiem
was born in 1996. Some years later, John Carpenter, who was then a graduate student in
Shakespeare studies, came to talk to me about music. He had played for years with a really
good reggae/ska/rock-steady outfit in Miami. He said he was a guitarist and wanted to jam with
me one day since he had heard I played in a reggae band. At the time, my band Ujamaa had
just had a reunion and we were realizing a live CD to commemorate things, and so I gave the CD
to John along with some demo material. We met to jam and he talked a lot about the work.
He said he would love to collaborate with me. So I gave him Requiem on a whim, and told him
to see what he could come up with. When I heard what he had done, I was really impressed.
Moved, even. I knew we had to perform it somewhere. And we worked together to turn it
into a performance which was staged at the Columbia Museum of Art. Tom Feelings was
generous enough to allow us to project images form the book as I read and we performed.
Requiem was performed with a small trio of musicians and myself.

SASSY: Tell us about your process. How have some of your other collaborative
projects come about? Did you find someone's photographs/paintings/music that you enjoyed and
then approached them? Did you begin writing first and then shared the idea, or are there some
ideas that were themselves collaborations?

DAWES: Typically, the process begins with the writing. But that is only a part of the
story. The truth is that each project comes through a different path. Sometimes I am
commissioned to respond with poetry to some already existing art. This happened when I
wrote the poems for Bruised Totems, which is based on the famous Bareiss Collection of African
Art. There, one could call this a passive collaboration. I was not working directly with the
