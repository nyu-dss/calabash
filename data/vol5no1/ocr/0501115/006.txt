various places separately but which we intend to publish as a joint text at some point. Here the
dialogue is not unlike the renga, but does evolve through conversations that take place outside
the writing. Nonetheless, we remain inscribed in the idea of the writer as essentially working in
isolation.

SASSY: For the collaborations that have been performed, how have they been received
and what do you account for that reception? Has there been any challenges in staging any
particular performance?

DAWES: In terms of reception I can say that these collaborations have always been well
received. Indeed, these performances have often been described by folks attending as some of
the most moving poetry performances they have attended. No doubt, much of this is because of
the way in which these performances touch on the senses--the music and the visual images can
add to the experience significantly. I have had a few people express the wish that the music
could be lowered in some sequences. But it is quite uniform that these performances have
tended to be stellar ones and ones that have been well received. I say this without arrogance, as I
am acutely aware of the fact that much of what makes these performances work so well is the
skill and creative power of the people I have collaborated with. The greatest challenge of
performances of this nature is the cost to mount them. Usually the team is a large one and it
does cost money to house and transport so many people. Tom Feelings was present for the first
showing of Requiem and he was deeply moved by it and pleased. Wisteria was performed
before the family of many of the women who were subjects in the piece and in front of the few
surviving women and they too were touched and appreciative of the work. I was nervous about
that one. Brian Rutenberg has read the poems based on his art and has expressed pleasure at the
work. These poems along with his art are collected in a chapbook called Brimming. He
granted us permission to use the work. I mention these responses because I think that the great
concern about projects like this might well be a feeling that somehow the art is being
compromised by the poetry or the music. I have not seen that kind of response. Indeed, Tom
Feelings would later give me some two hundred of his illustrations of children and ask me to
write poems in response to those pieces. The result of that collaboration was the book, / Saw
Your Face. Feelings designed the book after selecting one of the poems I had written as the
basis for the book.

SASSY: Youâ€™ve certainly already touched upon this, Kwame, but I'd like to ask the
question nonetheless. In addition to your interest in theatre why are you particularly interested
in collaboration? How does collaboration push the possibilities of both your own art and that to
which you are responding?

DAWES: I think that the collaborative process begins long before the thought of
performance comes up. I tend to respond well to the work of others, especially visual arts. But
I also respond to poetry by others and fiction by others. I am working on a massive project that is
based on the work of a playwright. The poems are not retellings of the plays, but are
encounters with the poetic possibilities in the plays. The poems, then, are lyrical and are rooted
