POET

(For Mervyn Morris, Edward Baugh,
and Wayne Brown)

This chronicler of our pain

has the jewels of tears in his eyes,
through which he sees

where the treasure lies buried

on the map of our suffering.

At another time,

the tears are the precious stones of laughter,
through which he sees

the route to the mountain,

habitation

of that mysterious form of understanding
that triggers our mirth.

Suffering we share with all sentient beings;
laughter, it seems, is ours alone.

Using the poet's map,

the philosopher seeks our deepest secret

in the unity of both.
