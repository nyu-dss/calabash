In the first section, the great grandmother first appears in the poem Before Electricity, in
which an old man tells his great grandchild the story of love between him and “a true Jamaican
woman” (14) that spans sixty-one years and brings twelve children into existence. Two
poems later in Girl the great grandmother speaks when she tells her great grand daughter the
story of a “navel-string which blossomed/a patch of first flowers” (16), and then names the
granddaughter in honor of the blossoms, the old woman’s own “red ginger” (16). With the act
of naming, the great grandmother engages in the artist’s preoccupation with remaking the world
by thinking about “What to put in?/What to leave out?” (43) of the life of the little girl that she is
shaping. But like Yoshitoshi’s Women, the great grandmother sensitively conceives and molds
the details of a live by giving her great granddaughter the name of something beautiful, the name
of a flower, and a legacy that promises that more beautiful things will come from this flower to
grace the world.

In speaking to the Gir/ of the collection, the great grandmother instructs the grand
daughter on how to live as her “great grandma’s child” in a world where “star-apples -/them will
bind you up” and “Spirits can take the shape of animals” (17-18). In her speaking, the great
grandmother becomes the creative life force that teaches the little girl how to take freely of the
world and make it her own even as spirits take the shape of male serpents that await with “evil
intent in their glowing red eyes”(26) to destroy paradise. Notably, there is an absence of the
father, a male figure merely relegated to the edge of “few pictures” that are “never in focus” (24).
In the instances where the father appears, he is a frustrated “master painter”, a failed creator who
“never seemed to get it right/could never paint us back-once and for all-/-the genesis-/his
beautiful garden (19). The absence of the father underscores a narrative of patriarchal tyranny,
which comes out in one of the most haunting poems in the collection when a male figure ruins
The Smell of Mango for a seven year old girl as he “raises himself up, /pulls the zipper on his
pants” (25) and commits and act of unspeakable violence against her.

In an unforgettable second section, readers are introduced to the flora of paradise where
exotic flowers display their exuberant personalities as they speak about themselves and to each
other in a series of poems. Characters such as the drunken and swearing /xora, the Love Bush
filled with shameless desire, and the wild Canna Lily are but three of the all-female flowers cast
that make an appearance as the representative Fauna among which Red Ginger makes an
appearance in Full Bloom to recite a blessing that honors the “green-giving voice” (39) of
Bishop’s prayer poems.

In the third set of poems, the life-giving energy of women is represented by competing
