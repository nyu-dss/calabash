PARADISE LOST ... AND FOUND

The exquisitely beautiful poems contained in Jacqueline Bishop’s debut collection,
Fauna, strike the reader less like poetry and more like a narrative, compelled by a need to look
back at the past in order to create the future. The sense of narrative compunction begins with
the expressions contained in the first poem, An End, Or Maybe A Beginning, in which the
speaker asks for forgiveness for telling stories that she may not remember “right... after ...
after .../ God knows how many years” (13). Despite the possibility of the failure of memory,
however, the poems insist that they be told, again and again, to whomever will stop and listen
before they “come to an end — a closing/of the circle of myth and memory.” In their insistence,
the poems present an opportunity for Bishop to remember past experiences and stories running
into each other like Yeats’s ever widening gyre. Indeed, in their insistence, the poems force
Bishop always to look back, like Lot’s wife, in a heroic attempt to confront the memories that
terrify, but which memories also have the power to liberate the psyche and transform the soul.

Divided into four sections, the poems are grouped into large categories that fall roughly
along the lines of family, flowers, women, and the island of Jamaica. At their core, however, all
the poems come together around the myths of creation and the memories of paradise that have
the power to shape a life. In this collection, paradise is a specific place, the island of Jamaica,
and paradise is shaped by a specific person, namely the great grandmother, who fulfills the
maternal longings of someone whose mother was long lost, “not felt, not touched” (24). The
strong maternal image of the great grandmother in the collection conflates the island with the
mother as a cultural site of nurturing that shapes the experience of paradise as decidedly

feminine.
