images of Eve and Lilith. In many of the poems, Eve represents the first mother who failed in
her task to preserve paradise for the safety of future generations. Eve/first mother
internalizes her failure deep enough to inflict its punishments on her daughters: “All those years
when my mother knew exactly/what my grandfather was doing, she knew,/and she let it continue.
Her excuse: It happened to me too” (26) And yet Bishop redeems the first mother, by
acknowledging that perhaps Eve had been given an unfair burden in the first place, and can
conceive of “Eve’s decision to listen to the snake” as a form of bravery in approaching the
unknown” (55). While Eve represents the failure the mother who is complicit in the evil of the
serpent, Lilith represents the dark and frightening specter of female empowerment that western
patriarchy confines to “tattered/and un-translated texts,/so carefully hidden in the stacks....”
(56).

Ironically, it is through the image of Lilith, a woman who craved an identity of her own,
that Bishop pays homage to women as nurturers, muses, life-givers, and as people who sacrifice
of themselves so that other can blossom. In this section, readers meet a nine-year-old-girl, “bud
barely coming into flower” (46), who surrenders her body to a grandfather that threatens her
apple tree with a cutlass, in exchange for the fruits that will eventually feed many who come and
eat of the tree. Itis a similar spirit that leads Joan of Arc to sacrifice herself although “No one
took the time to record/ the details about her” (53) for the sake of posterity; and a similar spirit
which compels a woman in Kenya to plant trees into a greenbelt in Carnage, a poem dedicated
to Nobel peace prize winner, Wangari Maathai.

When reading Zhe Apple Tree and Carnage together, the rape of the nine year old is
conflated with the destruction of the earth and the element of continuous female sacrifice; the
little girl for a tree that will live and nurture others beyond her pain, and the woman bent over
faithfully planting trees one by one. In the poem Don’t You Know This Woman an old slave
woman asks what is to become of her after Emancipation when Massa Backra, like all other
exploiters, has taken everything and let her go with nothing. The next six poems respond to the
old slave woman by telling her that she, like a work of art, is a careful blend of “Leaving in what
is essential, taking out what/is not” (44). In the final analysis, the old slave woman becomes an
Island Juice Blend; exotic, open to exploitation, but nevertheless possessed of a spirit and a
presence outside of her exploited image.

It is after readers come to understand women in their historical and cultural complexities
that Bishop takes us back to the ultimate mother, the island-paradise that is the beautiful

Xamayca -- land of wood and water. In this section, Bishop assigns the island-paradise the role
