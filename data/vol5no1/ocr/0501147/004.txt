of mother, who while it appears to be a victim, is also a victor who holds the promise of
redemption. In this section, the island-paradise beckons, over Africa, Zhe Mountain In The
Distance, through the archipelago of Caribbean islands right back to the great grandmother, so
that the little girl goes back to the island/mother to become the great grandmother herself. Thus,
the island-paradise is the site of oppression but also the place of resistance where the narratives
of myth and memory present an alternative to the history of the loss of innocence and make it
possible to regain paradise. In this section, a male figure is used as a trope of loss when Pa
cannot remember his own offspring. This loss of memory brings the collection full circle so
that the latter poems resonate with the sentiments of the opening poem when a little girl she
realizes that there is still more to become and embraces the transformative power of vagrancy,
transience and migration, which are also a part of the legacy of Jamaican Fauna. Here the bird
is an appropriate symbol for the children of the island-paradise who must spread their wings and
fly so they can end up in New York, at the Metropolitan Museum imagining the myths of their
own lives in a place of imaginative release and freedom, where being beyond anything
imaginable, is possible.

With this collection Jacqueline Bishop offers a narrative of female empowerment that
reflect choices about what is essential to leave in and what is necessary to take out so that the
stories of myth and memory create a meaningful life,

“Never mind, you will fly.

You will fly! Your wings

Have not, despite what they tell you, been clipped” (55).

Indeed, as the closing poem indicates, the future is not only possible, it is in progress with the
noise of the world fading as the power of art to remake the world begins to take place. Red

Ginger, we await more.
