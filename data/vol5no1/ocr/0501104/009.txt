vulnerable, they get in touch with their hurt. I worked so hard, and for a long time to give these
men the space to find this light that they each do, to not succumb to the try-and-proven, to
branch out on their own, to accept and live their own truth without fear or contrition. Yes, it is
love that has amplified this work, and my inherent belief that men can and will change, and be
sources of inspiration and compassion. It also helps that I know a number of Jamaican men like
this who after divorce, single-handedly, cared for their children, who because they were flogged
senselessly as a children, refused to spank their children, who don’t womanize, who live
meaningful lives in which they support each other and their community. I would like to think I
have raised a son who fits this mold, and equally important, I believe there is a man out there,
who wants to partner with me in love and compassion who fits this mold, and that daily we will
see more men such emerge if we stop “bad mouthing” them, if we give them a chance,
encourage them in their growth and transformation. Writing is very powerful, and especially in
these times, we have to be conscious of what we are writing into being. These men are from a
deep and abiding consciousness of fashioning important links and harmonious connections

between men and women, regardless of our sexual preferences.

MICHELA: Talking about violence and abuse, it is impossible not to think of the violence
brought to the Caribbean islands by colonization, a theme that is recurrent, though in different
ways, in the works of most Caribbean writers. The stripping of culture and language, the rape of
land, bodies and minds, the attempt at depriving a whole people of its dignity — how can poetry

helps coming to terms with this terrible history.

PALMER ADISA: | am wrestling with that now in my still to complete collection, Crossing,
which is the story of my great, great maternal grandmother and how she came to be enslaved,
and how she survived the middle passage. It is mostly imaginative, although I have been doing
historical research. What poetry and literature written by Caribbean people do is make the
violence pallitable, remind us that we are not mad and didn’t imagine or exaggerate it, that it was
worse than we could have every imagined yet we survived. The poetry reinforces our strength,
our resilience, our right to be present in the New World as this time, but it also forces us to be
conscious of what we underwent to come out on this side. Those of us who understand
evolution are not surprised or amazed by this new wave of violence that is occurring all over the
Caribbean and the Black Diaspora, as it is inevitable given how we were introduced into the new

world, and the tremendous silencing that was imposed on us about our horrific experience.
