MICHELA: Your poetry has a gender, and it is distinctly ‘female,’ how can we define the
female Caribbean aesthetics of your poetry? Is there a difference between female and male

aesthetics?

PALMER ADISA: Absolutely! While women and men in the Caribbean share a common
landscape and even language (but here again there are decidedly female and male words and
phrases), they occupy separate arenas. Although my last collection, Until Judgment Comes,
2007, is about seven different Jamaican men, for the most part I write about women, the world I
am most familiar with. And even in that collection, it is through the elderly woman, the
“Teachment” section which connects those stories, that I am really able to fully access those men
—I come to know them by the information she shares that piques my interest. But to respond to
your question about the female aesthetic of my poetry, I have to say I always see Jamaican
women as “big women,” not in terms of physical size, but in terms of their heart, their desire,
their independence and defiance — the way they take on life, determined to win at all cost. They
are philosophical, keen observers, always have something to say about everything — their words
as sweet as neaseberry or as piercing as a red ant bite. Mostly, what I tune into is their zeal; their
interplay with their men and children, their friendships with each other and their

single-mindedness to achieve their goals — they will not be turned back.

MICHELA: Motherhood, in relation to both ‘creatures’ of flesh and blood and ‘creatures’ of the
mind, is a recurrent theme in your work. You are a mother, a poet, a performer: How do you

combine all these roles and how hard is it to be a good writer and a good mother?

PALMER ADISA: It is a challenge to be good at both, and I hope my children, to some degree,
would concur that I have been a good mother. These two ventures are so closely connected to
who I am and I think, now that I reflect back, I came to both as a similar age. I believe it was
between my eight and ninth birthday that I knew I wanted to be a writer, and it was also at that
time that I began dreaming of being a mother, and knew with certainty that I would do both. The
essay in Lros Muse, “The Swelling of a Womb/The Forging of a Writer,” is really a blueprint for
how I have accomplished both. My desire to share all these stories/ideas with my children, to
leave them a true legacy of who I am/was, also fuels the work. It is not easy, but itis possible. I

have been more prolific since I have been a single mother (for the last thirteen years) than when I
