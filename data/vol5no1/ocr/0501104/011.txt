PALMER ADISA: I can name writers and other important people, but the profound truth is that
my greatest influence has been Catherine, my mother and the Jamaican people. In Eros Muse,

the essay, “Lying in the Tall Grasses Eating Cane,” mentions my literary influences.

The discussion of literary heritage and influence is of vital importance in the writing of Opal
Palmer Adisa, since, as we’ve mentioned before, it is associated with that of language, which is

at the root of Caribbean identity.

Being raised, as she recounts it, “in a colonial society with a British education” she thought that
writers were dead white people or people who lived elsewhere and “talked about sleet... and
watched daffodils.”
Only while attending a New York high-school did she come across works by such writers as
Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks and, above all Jean Toomer. It was indeed Toomer’s Cane
(1923) that led young Opal to become a writer. Turning the last page of that book, she knew
what she wanted to do with her life. She would become a writer, she “wanted to write, not in the
surreptitious manner that [she] had been engaged in all along, but openly, to share with others.”
Later on, her writing and performing career would be strongly influenced by other pivotal
encounters. The first was with painter and poet LeRoy Clarke who read her poems and told her
she was indeed “a poet”; later came the mesmerizing performance of Sonia Sanchez reading her
own poems, which dispelled Opal’s fears about sharing her works with others, reading them
aloud, in front of an audience. In fact, it helped Opal Palmer Adisa find her own voice.
Meanwhile the whole of the Caribbean was undergoing radical changes . Works by
Caribbean artists had become part of school programs; poets such as Mervyn Morris and Kamau
Brathwaite were teaching at the University of West Indies; the atmosphere was inspirational and
full of possibilities. Now more attention was being paid to the issue of language. The new poetry
needed its own language and Creole language, the dialect of Louise Bennet, was the only means
to communicate not only the rhythm and pulse of Caribbean life, the sensuality and beauty of its
landscape, but also the strength of its identity, the depth of its soul. In it, Opal Palmer Adisa, the

poet, found her own language.
