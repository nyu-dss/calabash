and just enjoy good laughs with friends. However, I find I don’t produce a lot when my house
is jumping with activities and there are too many distractions. I used to be able to work with lots
of interruptions and distractions when my children were young, but now I require and demand
solitude. It’s not so much that writing is private, but rather that the writer needs to be able to
listen and to hear her characters, and if necessary to talk to them, to interrogate them, and to try
out stuff that the characters are doing so she can best describe their actions. If one were to put a
camera and observe me when I am working for long stretches of time, on a story or novel, them
one might think me mad, as I get up and walk about and seemingly talk to myself and engage in
various gestures as I try to visualize the room the character is in within the story and how they
occupy the space. That is what requires privacy, the transporting of yourself into those various
spaces as you try to write about them, when you have never really inhabit such a space. The
tile story, “Until Judgment Comes,” presented me with such challenges, Jeremiah in all those
enclosed spaces. I would not have been able to really feel him, and feel myself into his space if I

all know there are men who are soft and caring, and supportive. All too often, what is omitted is
that many of the men who are abusers where deeply abused as children, by both mothers and
fathers, but many by mothers left alone to make do. How does the emotional, psychological
and physical abuse of a boy child impacts his sense of self, his ability to love and trust women
once he becomes an adult, his ability to care for children, to respond to other crises in his life in a
non-violent way? My collection examines these questions, and looks at and portrays men as
victims just like women, as human beings trying to forge an identity separate and apart from
their painful childhood, and through love, all are able to do this — to risk being alienated from
society in order that each might carve out a niche for himself, of his own making. Ebenezer

does, as does Devon aka Bad-Boy, as does Jeremiah. Each of these men allow themselves to be
