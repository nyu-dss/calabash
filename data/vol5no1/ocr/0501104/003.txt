PALMER ADISA: [ have just returned, last month, from a conference at The University of the
West Indies honoring Louise Bennett. Bennett as you may know, for many years was not
recognized as the talented poet that she is because of her insistence on using Nation Language or
Creole. Ihave to credit Bennett for granting me permission, so to speak, to write in Nation
Language, because it was her usage that allowed me to see the beauty of our language.
Moreover, there are just some things that don’t have the same sense of intimacy or color if not
said in Nation language. So for example, the two poems you cite are rooted in the culture that
to say or write them in standard English, it seems to me, would be to eradicate the very people I
am celebrating. I use nation language when it is the only way and the best way to get my point
across, to say what I mean from the center of my navel. But I also use it, to interrupt and disrupt
standard English as s reminder to myself that I have another tongue, but also to jolt readers to
listen and read more carefully, to glean from the language the Caribbean sensibilities that I am
always pushing, sometimes subtly, other times more forcefully. Nation language allows me to

infuse the poem with all of the smells and colors of home.

MICHELA: In your opinion, is there such a thing as a Caribbean aesthetics? If there is, what is
it that makes it Caribbean?

PALMER ADISA: I will readily say yes, there is a Caribbean aesthetic, but of course defining it
requires careful thought. The question is partly rhetorical because if there is a region called the
Caribbean, then it follows that such a place, populated with people, would have a specific culture
and therefore that culture, as long as it is not stagnant, then would have its own cosmology and
aesthetics. Now to try and define, rather theorize, what that is without citing icons such as Bob
Marley, Rastafarianism, ackee and salt-fish, requires intellectual engagement. Caribbean
aesthetic involves a feeling of ownership, of defiance, of belong; it’s the symbiotic relationship
between the people and the entire environment, which is often personified and is an active agent
that participant in the people’s lives. The aesthetic’s motto can be said to be: The ability “fi tek
bad things mek laugh.” In other words, the people’s refusal to lay down and die, or to allow
hard times and sadness to determine the range of their lives. Instead, the people use these
challenges to laugh at themselves as well as life, thereby being able to recoup their losses and go
forth. Caribbean aesthetics involves physical gestures as well, which speak volumes... I love to
observe the interaction, the bodily communication; it is simply marvelous in its innuendos and

inferences.
