“A SPACE OCCUPIED BY SWIRLING
CARIBBEAN WATERS”
AN INTERVIEW WITH OPAL PALMER ADISA

OPAL PALMER ADISA embodies what many of us would like to achieve, but only few do: She
is a world-renowned poet and writer, a professor of creative writing and literature, and a loving
mother. Born in Kinston, Jamaica, she lives in the United States and frequently visits Jamaica ,
whose presence is felt throughout her stunning stage performances as well as her body of work —

poetry, stories and non-fiction publications.

An important aspect of her poetry is the use of Creole, which she views as means to assert an
identity — the Caribbean identity; indeed, the use of Creole allows her “to infuse the poem with
all of the smells and colors of home.” The issue of /Janguage — of which language to use in her
poetry — is directly influenced by the notion that a free people cannot fully express itself in the
language of its oppressor. Moreover, since language reflects a certain set of values and a defined
culture, Opal employs it, with all its thrilling sensuality, to challenge the colonial haughty
righteousness and asserts the carnality of smells, colors, rhythms and tradition — the whole

Caribbean world.

But not only is Opal Palmer Adisa one of the most accomplished artists of her generation, she is
also a committed artist: she is the co-founder of Watoto Wa Kuumba, a children’s theatre group

which she directed from 1979 to 1991; she is the parenting editor and host of KPFA Radio
