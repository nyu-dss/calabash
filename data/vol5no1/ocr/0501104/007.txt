there: where the people came from, and why they came — the personal stories, not just the
historical events, WWII and the desire for a better life that prompted such migration-- doing that
project. It was areal eye-opener for me to sit with these seniors, many for two to four hours
and just listen to them talk. I wished some youths were with me so they could hear how their
fore-parents dealt with obstacles, how they believed in themselves, how they worked together,
how they daily and yearly believed in their dream and worked assiduously to make their dreams

existed in Oakland. [interviewed about fifty seniors, but I focused on twenty-three, and had

PALMER ADISA: Yes, for the most part it is private, and as I get older and my children are
