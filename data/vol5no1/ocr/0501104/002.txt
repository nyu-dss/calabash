MICHELA: Opal, this interview is long overdue, and with so much time passing it’s only
natural that the list of questions I would like to ask you has grown very long. I would like to
begin with the physical urge a reader experiences reading your poetry to stand up and sing and
dance. Your words seem to sing, or one might say they should be sung rather than merely read.

Would you agree with this interpretation?

PALMER ADISA: I wish I were a singer then I would sing my poems; I think they would
sound very moving as songs, but I speak them, with passion and lots of rhythm. I am glad that
you hear them as songs and dance; they have lots of movement, and I suspect that is what you
hear. I try and hope that non-Caribbean readers will hear the beat of the Caribbean as they read

them, the waves, the swaying of the palm trees, the gusto of the people.

MICHELA: The music and rhythm that inform your work take us into a whole new world of
sensuous colors, sounds and smells, reflecting local identity, culture, landscape and history.
Could you tell us more about the use of Creole, or Nation Language, in your writing? I’m

thinking of “Where I Come From,” but also “Fi Me People,” among many other poems.
