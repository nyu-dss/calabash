More is being written now about enslavement and more will be written, and each new work will
add to the healing. I truly believe it is the poetry and fiction that will allow us to heal the

wounds of enslavement and write a new and more holistic future that is free of violence.

MICHELA: In Eros Muse, the whole sequence of poems dedicated to “Muse,” offers us an
example of meta-poetry. Was this a conscious decision that came prior to putting pen to paper or

did the poems “dictate” their own form while you were writing?

PALMER ADISA: I truly did mediate and reflect on who or what my muse is, and it came to
me very clearly, perhaps because sex is an important aspect of who I am, that my muse was a
lover, not just any lover, but an ardent, faithful, adventurous lover, a combination of some of the
men in life, but also having qualities of my ideal man, that I have not yet met, but have certainly
imagined. After that it was easy, all of the poems then explored an aspect of our relationship as
it relates to writing and sex, as here again, both go together in some profound and sensual ways.
However, the form the poems took was more organic and each emerged raw, without prior

decision before my fingers touched the keyboard.

MICHELA: How would you define your own journey from Bake-Face and Other Guava
Stories to Until Judgement Comes?

PALMER ADISA: LAUGHTER....Not sure I can... well although there is a twenty plus year
difference between these collections, once I completed Bake- face I knew I wanted to write the
companion stores about the men, but it took me that long to figure out the men, or rather to be
willing to let them tell their stories without my feminist interjection and interpretation.

Sometime in the future I would like both of these books to be printed as one collection... They
are really meant to be read together as companion pieces. They are the same story, just different
side of the coin, so to speak. In both instances, the women and the men, equally, are begging to

be listened to without interruptions.

MICHELA: Can you name a person or persons who have influenced your work, be they writers,

artists or ordinary people?
