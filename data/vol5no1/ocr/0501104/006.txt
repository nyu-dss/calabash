based on the truth that I have set forth. I am able to achieve this seduction by peeping into
many windows then compressing all I have seen and have learnt into a language that gives the
reader a sense of fair-play, but all along, I, the writer, control the field. All that aside, I would
like to think of myself as a fairly open-minded person, predisposed to justice and truth, an
advocate for the underdog — I credit my colonial experience for this bias—and an eternally
optimist, who is not only able to see the good in any and every situation, but 1s also able to
salvage and hold up the good as beacon of hope to others. Believe it or not, a writer is always at
the center of every work she produces, but she must get out of her own way, and the way of the
characters and stories in order for the work to really live and have impact on readers. She must
create a distance, and exercise judgment so that the necessary historical, social, political and

personal data that belongs and feeds the works can be woven in flawlessly.

MICHELA: Poets and writers, many argue, are passive observers of society who shy away from
direct active roles. We’ve seen, though, a number of writers who have enrolled their art in the
service of their communities. Would you share your thoughts about the role of an artist in

society?

PALMER ADISA: My work is closely aligned with my community and the hopes I have for it,
and for the future of the world. I believe those of us from certain geographic regions and who
emerged out of a of a specific era, and who understand that without community we are nothing,
so our writing serves and helps to promote and offer viable alternatives for our respective
communities. I don’t have or certainly don’t want to have the luxury to be disengaged, to only be
concerned with my own personal narcissistic issues. While I insist on autonomy, and that
writers/artists’ themes/forms should not be prescribed or dictated either by community or
political governments, I will assert that it is irresponsible for a writer/artist not to be connected to
and feel some kind of affinity with a community, and therefore, whose work in some way

interfaces and connects with said community.

MICHELA: Talking about the poet’s role in society, I cannot but bring forth your involvement
with the “Tales of a Forgotten Glory: West Oakland Senior Citizen Oral History Project.” Can

you tell us more about this experience?

PALMER ADISA: I learned a great deal about Oakland, and the African American community
