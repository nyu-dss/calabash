was married. It also means I have or have trained very wonderful children to support me in my
work. But the truth is I have to write; if I don’t it’s like fever burning me up from inside out.
So between motherhood and writing, you have my total life, very little room for much else. I
love my children, and I am proud of each of them, but I am also happy that two are out of the
house; well my son who just began college still has one foot home, so to speak, but my older
daughter is done with undergraduate, lives in another city and is doing her own thing; my
youngest daughter has only one more year in high school, then I am truly free to focus almost all

of my attention on my work.

MICHELA: Writers bring diverse experiences into their work, at times borrowing from their
own life, at others creating characters whose perceptions and points of view are far from their
own, still rendering their story real and believable.

How does a writer achieve the necessary distance while at the same time bringing together, in the

act of writing, the historical, the biological, the social, the personal?

PALMER ADISA: While I have written a number of creative non-fiction essays, I have not
really culled from my personal life experience, (well expect as reference point for much of my
poetry), for the body of my work. While a personal memory may jolt or prompt an idea, I am
always seeking multiple perspectives, to find another way to come at the event/situation. I
eavesdrop. Ikeenly, even unconsciously listen to people wherever I go, I watch them, I make
up stories about them, I weave them into things I am writing, I rework them to be who I want
them to be, to say what I think the moment or situation demands. I don’t really have any
problems distancing my life from what I write, because in many ways they are parallel stories
that never intersect. However, very often, readers/the public, assumes that I write about my
life, and I am getting closer to being able to do that either in fiction or as a memoir or even an
autobiographical novel. Yet because of the way my mind works, my penchant for making up
things, I suspect that even in such work I will invent myself and my life the way I want to
portray myself, which I think is a writer’s perogative. Of course, what I am about to say next
might seem contradictory to the above, but I don’t think there are these clean lines of
demarcation between the historical, the biological, the social, or the personal. In truth they
always intersect, some places more closely than others. In my work, I am very conscious of
this craft, and how I can use it to manipulate and even skew a specific point of view. Iam at

heart and at labor a seducer, seducing the reader to believe or identify with a certain character,
