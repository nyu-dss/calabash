spear heads was used up because I see the man swimming away and the woman following him,
and the daughter after that.

When we get back to the boat, everybody was tired and the weather was starting to act up.
I didn’t want to take the chance of trying to sail all the way back, so we dock in a nearby cove to
spend the night.

Bill, the man, couldn’t stop talking about what a wonderful adventure it was.

“Jerry, boy, you really did deliver. That was certainly exciting and dangerous. And
boy, oh boy, being so close to death. Feeling its power. Its force. Its vibrations. There’s
no experience like it. No experience at all.” And his wife agree. That woman agree with
everything.

By this time, all of us was drinking. And outside, the sea was stirring up, rocking our
little boat back and forth. Then it start to thunder and rain. So I lock everything up tight and
tell everybody goodnight.

I was so drunk to tell you the truth, I ain’t exactly clear on what happen after that. What
I remember was opening my eyes in the dark little cabin. Thunder, lightning and rain was still
going on outside. Right across the way I could see Bill and his wife when the lightning flash.
The two of them was naked, moaning and groaning and holding onto one another. Even with
the weather outside so loud, I could still hear them. I didn’t know what to do, so I turn my back
and close my eyes, figuring I would fall asleep again.

And I guess I musta. But the next time I wake up it was still night and the girl, the
daughter, Andrea was her name, Andrea was lying next to me on the bunk. We didn’t talk.

We just start to touch and kiss. When the real business start to happen, all I could think was I
wish that I wasn’t so drunk. But, somehow we manage.

Again I musta fall asleep, because when I open my eyes again, it wasn’t Andrea next to
me. It wasthe mother. She and I start to kiss and do things, too.

Next morning when I wake up the cabin was empty. Iwas the only one stillinbed. I
was naked and my shorts was on the floor. I pull on my pants and went up. The sun was
shining, the three of them was on deck all dressed.

“Good moming. You were dead to the world,” the wife, Phyllis, said. “So we decided
to let you sleep.”

“Thanks.” Ilook around, the sea was calm.

“Nice day, isn’t it?”

“Yeah.”
