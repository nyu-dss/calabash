All kinds of fish was floating by, moving closer and closer, giving us the eye. The man,
Bill, he want to shoot one with his spear gun, but I signal him no.

A big grouper swim between us. I don’t think I ever seen a fish like that before. Thing
musta been as big as the side of a car with colors just sparkling in the sunlight.

I give the signal and we went down a little deeper to just where it was starting to get dark.
Not much but a little. A Barra pass and I didn’t like the way he was looking at me.

Barracudas is some dangerous creatures in the sea because they unpredictable. One minute
they standing still in the water, next minute they teeth in your side tearing out your flesh. I
don’t like them and I don’t trust him. I don’t trust them at all.

This one pass by me twice with he long silver body. The next time he pass I shot him
right in the side with my spear. The point shoot through from one side of his body to the other.
He wiggle and shake and then fall away with blood coming outta him like smoke.

Right away I swim from the spot because I could sense a little danger. I wasn’t wrong.
Sharks. The first one show up like he was curious, just looking around. When he see the

know it the place was pack with them.

I shot another fish. A big one and all them sharks went after it. I’m talking sixty,

fish. Man, the whole ocean look like it was all filled with blood and pieces of flesh. The man,
Bill, start swimming right to the spot where all them sharks was going crazy. I try to signal him.
Try to tell him to stay away. But he didn’t seeme. Hejust went rightin. Then his wife
follow him. She, I know, see me signaling them to stay away. But the woman ignore me.

She swim right up close to her husband just so they could be right in the thick of things.

“What’s wrong with these people?” I ask myself. “Is they crazy or what?” I watch them but I
didn’t go near. Then when the daughter join in, that’s when I knowed that I had seen
everything. What you had man, was maybe a hundred sharks eating like it was Judgment Day
and these three people damn near in the middle of it shooting them with the spear gun when they
get too close. The whole thing was like a dream. A crazy, bad dream that wasn’t a dream but
real.

I still didn’t join them. Ikeep my distance. See, I ain’t no fool. They can risk they

life if they like but I ain’t following them there. But they musta start running outta air or all the
