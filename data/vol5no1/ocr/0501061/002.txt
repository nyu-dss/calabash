exciting. Exciting and dangerous. I ask the man what he mean.

“T want to go out in the water and do something really different and heart-stopping.”

I look at him and ask, “Man, what you planning to pay for such a thing?” He look back
at me and said, “Name your price.”

I didn’t know what to tell this man. Every time you go out to sea, it exciting and
dangerous. You hit the wrong weather or go out in a small boat too far and don’t know what
you doing, that ocean will swallow you up.

Caribbean Sea might be pretty. But it treacherous too, if you don’t know how to show it
some respect.

I still didn’t know what to tell this man. I ask around about him and people say the man
had alot of money. Say he was some kind of writer who like to put exciting things in he stories.
So I think and think. Then I call the man and ask him if he knowed anything about serious
diving.

He tell me yes. Then he say he was bringing he wife and his daughter along. “We've
been all over the Caribbean and have done every kind of diving imaginable.” That sound okay
to me plus the women belong to him, not to me soI didn’t care. I told him my price, he agreed
to everything and that was that.

We went out to a place called “The Hole.” Ain’t nothing there. Just a patch of sea in
the middle a nowhere. But it so damn dark and deep that most fishermen like to stay away
from it. Superstition had it that the devil live there and you stay round it long enough, he will
pull you down.

“Here is where we gon dive,” I tell him. “This is the spot.” The women went below
and when they come back, they was in they bathing suits. I got to admit, I had to take a second
look. The older one who musta been in her forties had a shape on her look like something you
would see in a magazine orina movie. As I look at she, I found myself wondering why would
a woman shape like that marry a man with gray hair and beard and a big belly? Must be for his
money. That’s all I could think. Must be for his money and his fame.

Then the daughter come out. Oh God, don’t even talk about her. She musta been
about nineteen or twenty. But, oh Lord have mercy, she was something too.

We get into our wet suits, fix on the air tanks and flip in the water. I kinda circle them
around a little bit, just to get a feel a the place. The water was calm and the sun was shining
bright. You could see a good ways down. Not the bottom, of course. Too damn dark and

deep for that, but a good ways down anyhow.
