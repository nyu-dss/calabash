“The storm doesn’t seem to have done any damage,” the man tell me.

“No.”

“Want some coffee,” the wife ask.

“Sure.”

We sit and talk some more. And all the while we talking, I’m looking at their faces to
see if I could get any kind of clue as to what went on last night. But I didn’t get a one.

When we was alone, getting ready to sail back, I ask Andrea if she sleep well.

“Well enough, considering,” she tell me.

“Considering what?”

“Well you know, the bad weather and all.”

“Yeah, yeah. I know what you mean.”

We dock back on St. Chrispus three hours later. Bull paid me and said it was “one hell
of a trip.”

People tell me I was lucky to find a cove for shelter because the storm was bad. Four
boats was lost and the Coast Guard was out looking for them.

Some fishermen who was out at sea say that in the middle of the storm they see the
Virgin Mary with the child in one hand and the world in the next. And when the lightning flash
she tell them that the world was getting heavy and she thinking ‘bout dropping it.

People can laugh when they hear the kind of work Ido. But Pll tell you something. It

ain’t all just swimming and diving.
