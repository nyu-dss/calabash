remembered the accident and the unbroken bottles of Port wine. I woke up upon hearing the
scream, and I remembered my own death, years later, in an accident, falling from a balcony.
And the silk-cotton tree was inside of my room, hovering over me with the smell of sadness.

The river that you see painted there, near Dofia Elita's house, it turned red with blood the
Night of Tears. Don Raul's blood had spilled upon the river when he had his accident.
Buckets of Tata's blood were thrown out of the balcony of the house that you see painted there.
As the spray from the Cascade fell upon the people, it turned red with anger. The bottles of
Port wine were stained with Ita's blood, as if they had been broken.

Ta left that night. She dressed up as a nun in order to flee. She wentto Miami. She
swallowed Abuelito's clock so as to take it out of Cuba. It was the only way to take it out. Ito
had told the police about her.

"Yes. Ta."

And as I try to sleep, my grandfather tells me the story from inside the painting. The
wise tree is outside, casting its Cuban shadows inside of my room. And I'm afraid. La Virgen
de la Caridad appeared to me once, too. The shadows were dissipated as the memory of my
grandfather waned like the wax melting from a big white church candle. The memory of my
grandfather emanates from inside the painting. It smells of the sadness of Victoriaâ€™s hair as she
flies inside my room, keeping the other butterfly bats from attacking my breath. It smells of
love.

And as I try to remember my grandfather, the painting fades with the loving spray from
the Cascade of Tears.

He is there in the painting. If you listen, you can hear him breathing. You can hear
him telling me the story. The ricochets from his voice fade away, melting like the wax from the
candle, covering my body like buckets of blood thrown from a balcony, from the balcony that
you see there in the painting.

The terrain that you see there, through the window, it belonged to Dofia Elita. But that's
another story, and not this one. This story is about the lizards and the butterfly bats.

If I try to remember the last things, it would be the lizards and the butterfly bats.
If I try to remember the first things, it would be my own death, through the death of the

memories of the voice, the voice of my grandfather resonating inside of my head, inside of the
painting that you see there, hanging on the wall.
