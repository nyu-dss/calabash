When Hatuey saw her, it reminded him of the story of my grandfather, who fell in love with
Miss Smith upon seeing her. But Lito had forgotten his destiny, and he was punished. He had
forgotten that life was but one long remembering. He had forgotten his marriage with Ita, many
years later, after having met Miss Smith at the ball to celebrate the defeat of the Spaniards.

When Hatuey saw Victoria, he fell in love. Upon seeing her, he remembered. He
remembered her from the beauty of the foam at the Cascade of Tears. The Cascade of Tears is
not far from the house that you see there, in the painting, and if you look closely you can feel the
spray of love coming from the effort of the tears falling over the rocks. They used to kiss under
the wise tree.

Victor, who was married to Victoria, started to doubt her when he felt her cheeks humid
with the spray from the Cascade of Tears. She smelled of love.

He told her that they had finally captured the renegade of Hatuey and that they were
going to kill him. He looked at her face for signs of weakness. Her hair smelled of sadness,
and he knew.

She implored the Indian gods, and she was transformed into a butterfly bat. She flew
out to find Hatuey. As Victor was getting ready to kill him, Victoria started flying above her
husband, forming a whirlpool of a halo above him. She sucked the life out of him. Victor
died from an asthma attack. Hatuey was free to go. Some say that he became a lizard and
that’s the reason why the butterfly bats and the lizards live together in the wise tree.

When Lito saw Miss Smith, Victoria started fluttering like the butterflies around a
quinqué, an oillamp. Victoria remembered. When Lito was going to kiss her, when he was
just about to forget, his breath was taken away. He remembered his mother and the books that
he wanted to read, and Lucumi Indiai. That was the second time that my grandfather died. He
died at the age of ten and then at the age of twenty, and he is still dying as he tells me the story
from inside the painting that you see there. And only through his death can my grandfather live
again. Only through death can we be born again.

When he came back from the dead, Miss Smith had gone back to Tampa. Her blue eyes
lingered in his memory like the scent of the sadness that emanated from the ivy hanging on the
wise tree. And from the tree, the smell of love reached him. He saw my grandmother framed
through the window. Ita was back from Key West. At first, he thought that it was La Virgen
de la Caridad that was taking him away to the land of the dead once more. She had already
appeared the day of Ita's accident.

Everybody thought that Ita would marry Ito, since that was in the order of things. But
Lito fell in love upon seeing her, and they married, for Victoria saw that their love was good, and
that Ito was cursed with the screams that resonate in Tata's madness. Victoria watches over
Lito, keeping away all the other butterfly bats.

When I cannot breathe at night, I pray to Victoria and I ask for forgiveness from my sins.
The shadow from the silk-cotton tree brings in the smell of sadness from Victoria's hair and the
sounds of wings fluttering against a quinqué. In that silence, I hear the screams of Ito and Tata,
and that of the unbroken bottles of glass.
