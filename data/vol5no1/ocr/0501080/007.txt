"T need a new shawl."
"Put on your shoes."

That accident is still happening, right now, in the writing of the accident. It had actually
never happened until now, until the writing of the accident. It is still happening in the screams
echoing from Lito's and Ito's birth and Tataâ€™s madness.

The girl from Tampa had blue eyes. She had studied French in Paris.
Put on your shoes. Wecan pick out the bottles of Port wine for the Doctor.

My grandfather did not know how to drive a car. He was driving the day of the accident.
The accident happened twice: in Cuba andin Miami. It happened many times, in many
different ways. It had already happened at the time of Hatuey's death in his fight against the
Spanish.

In Camagiiey, there is a wise tree where many lizards live. The tree is a Ceiba, and it
has been there since the beginning of time. But this is not the beginning of the story. The tree
was there even before the beginning, even before the tree could be here, in this story. The tree
is the one that you can see there in the painting of the house where my grandfather lived.

It was cold out, and she needed a shawl. I'll drive you to the store and then I'll go buy
the bottles of Port wine. I'll pick you up afterwards.

She died in the accident.
None of the bottles broke in the accident.

At night, I hear the sound of unbroken glass. As my grandfather tells me the story, right
now, from the other side of his memories, his silence is like the silence of the unbroken bottles of
glass. Through this silence, he tells me the story of Ita's death and of his own.

At night, I hear Hatuey running through the forest to avoid the Spanish.

Though I never met her, Ita used to tell me that it was thanks to America that she married
Lito. Ita was from El Barrio de la Caridad, where my grandfather lived in the house that you
see painted there with the traditional tinajon in front of it and with the wise tree where the lizards
and the butterfly bats live together. One summer, she went to Key West, Cayo Hueso, with her
sister America to study English at the Convent of La Virgen de la Caridad. That same summer,
the blue-eyed Miss Smith came from Tampa to visit a relative in El Barrio de la Caridad.

My grandfather first saw Miss Smith at a popular ball celebrating the end of the war with
the Spaniards.

The Spaniards had been there forever. My ancestors came from Spain, and that's why I
have so many dreams about Spain. Hatuey was one of the first Indians to rebel against the
Spaniards. He fell in love with one of Don Raul's ancestors, Victoria, who was married to a
Spaniard from the Basque Country. She was one of the first Spanish women to live in Cuba.
