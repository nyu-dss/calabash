He said that he was reading.

I remember that day vividly. The day that Dofia Elita got so mad that she stamped out
into the verandah and ripped the pages from my grandfather's book.

"A sick boy should not be reading. You know what the doctor said. No reading."

She never yelled, Dofia Elita. But her temper was known all throughout Camagiiey.
In Camagiiey, where the boys and the girls were reputed for their beauty, there lived a Doctor
that was a close friend of Dofia Elita. The Doctor had told her that it was proven that asthma
could not be cured and that it was caused by butterfly bats common in Camagiiey.

Some say that those butterfly bats go back to before the time of the Indians.

The Doctor told Dofia Elita that reading was bad for the boy. It aggravated his
condition.

Lito heard the Doctor telling that to his mother.
Lito saw the Doctor touch his mother's bare arm.

When I go to sleep and that I cannot breathe, I think of the Doctor touching my great
grandmother’s bare arm.

So Lito took all of his books and took them to the slaves’ quarters. They were mostly
about geography.

"Lucumi Indiai."

That's my grandfather talking. You can see him there in the slaves’ quarters. Lucumi
Indiai is Don Raul’s slave.

The slaves do not belong to Dofia Elita. Her house was modest. Only after my
grandfather's death did it become a big house. Only after my grandfather’s death, did she have
slaves.

They belonged to Don Raul, who had the most important library in all of Cuba.
He even had books in French.

Years later, Don Raul died while riding a horse near the river that you see there. He
owed my grandfather big, for Lito had represented him in the court of law when he had been
accused of his wife's murder. This happened during the revolt. When he died, he left his
entire library to my grandfather. Even the books in French. The Cardinal tried to steal the
books from Raul's estate. My grandfather being a lawyer and all, he knew that they belonged to
him. So he told the Cardinal that he couldn't take the books, for Don Raul had bequeathed them
tohim. The Cardinal blushed with anger and prayed. I still have one of Don Raul's books in
my shelves, Zola's Thérése Raquin. The book contains a dedication from a certain Carmen de
los Organos, who was proven guilty of Don Raul's wife's death.
