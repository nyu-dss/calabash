The Doctor came and talked to my great grandmother and told her that under no
circumstances was the child to read ever again. He looked at my great grandmother with the
lust of a traveler lost in a desert stumbling into the mirage of his own oasis.

So the terrain that you see out there belonged to Dofia Elita. And the house that you see
in that painting, with the traditional Cuban tinaj6n, that was the house where my grandfather
lived. He died of an asthma attack when he was ten. But through the remembering of his
death, he was born again. Only through the remembering of death can we be born again. Life
is but one long remembering.

I remember already writing the first sentence to this story. It was so long ago, before I
was ever born. This story goes back to the time of the butterfly bats.

Lito had a brother named Ito. Ito was completely inside of Lito when they were born.
They were twins. Lito, in turn, had twin daughters, Tata and Ta, who had two sons, my brother
andI, Oand_. Iam nameless like my great grandfather whose name was Abuelito.

My mother's sister, Tata, is the one that died when she fell from the balcony. Some
suspect that it was a suicide. Some even dared to say that it was her father Lito who killed her.
But I think that only the word death is important here. And besides Tata is like the lizard.

So the painting that you see there, that's the house. You can even see the verandah. If
you look closely, you can see the silhouette of the memory of my grandfather reading. This
story is but a silhouette of my grandfather's death. He is the one telling me the story as he sits
across me inside the painting. This story is the silhouette of the memories that my grandfather
brought back from his death at the age of ten when he had an asthma attack.

My grandfather thinks that the house that you see painted there is the house near the
Cascade of Tears in El Barrio de la Caridad, but only when he is on the other side of his
memories. Only in that side can the house be as nice as the one painted here with the tinajon in
front of it. Only in that side can the terrain belong to Dofia Elita. Only in that side of the
memories can he still be living there and telling me the story from inside of the painting. The
living only live in the telling of the past. Sometimes my grandfather seems sad. I think that it
is when he remembers his brother Ito and his wife Ita. I think that he is sad only on this side of
the memories.

At night, when I have asthma and I think about the Doctor, I think about Ito.

The Doctor delivered my grandfather in that house that you see painted there. If you
look closely, you can hear Dofia Elita's screams as she gave birth. The ricochets of her screams
formed shadows that still haunt me at night. The silk-cotton tree outside my room crawls inside
and engulfs me in the fears of Dofia Elita's womb at the time of my grandfather's birth. The
lizards and the butterfly bats live on the silk-cotton tree. Tata's screams reminded Lito of his
own birth and that is why he killed his own daughter.

The Doctor's face became pale as he saw the twins. They were born simultaneously for
Lito's body was completely engulfing his brother's, like a shadow from a silk-cotton tree.

Tata screamed the evil out of our family. In her screams, everything that the family
