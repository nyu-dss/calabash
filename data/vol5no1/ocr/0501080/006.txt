tried to forget surfaced with echoes of Lito and Ito's birth. Maybe that's why no one seemed to
care about her illness. We needed her. Now we carry the screams inside of us and there is no
one in the family that can purge us from the memories of our death.

The woman that you see in the picture frame, that's Ita. Her skin was whiter than it
appears in the picture though. It looked as if she were sculpted.

She died in an accident.

The girl from Tampa almost married Lito, but in the end, Ita did.

Words that should have been uttered but never did come out in the silence of our
conversations. The crevices that separate our memories are cemented through the silence of the

words that should have been uttered.

"T need new shoes."

That's Ita speaking to Lito. You can hear her voice in the silent memories resonating
inside of my grandfather.

"It's cold out. Put on a shawl."

He was always like that, my grandfather. He liked to command. He didn't like to
suggest.

Ineed new shoes. It's cold out. Put on a shawl.

"We can go by the store and buy the Port wine bottles that I want to give to the Doctor.
He did not let me pay the last time."

Hatuey was an Indian that lived when the butterfly bats first came to Cuba.

Sometimes at night, when I cannot sleep because of my asthma, I think about the Doctor,
about Ito, and about Hatuey.

"Do you want to go out in this weather?"

"I need new shoes."

"We can go by the store and pick out the bottles of Port wine."

It happened in Cuba and in Miami.

It happened in the memories of all of us. In the memory of Abuelito, and Lito, and Ito,
and Tata, and Ta, and O, andme. And inthe memory of Ita. And of Dofia Elita and Don Raul
and Lucumi Indiai and the Doctor. And of Hatuey and Victoria. Ita remembered her own

death. Inacar. InCuba. Near the house that you see painted there. She is the woman that
you see there in the picture frame. She looked as if she were sculpted.
