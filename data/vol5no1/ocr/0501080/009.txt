Some people think that it was because of Lito's wedding that Ito turned out the way he
did. His "yes" that Night of Tears changed the course of our history. That "yes" created
tremors in the memories of my mother Ta and in the memories of my grandfather Lito and in the

She was teaching like any other day.

Tata fell from the balcony as people threw buckets of water onto the street. And as she
