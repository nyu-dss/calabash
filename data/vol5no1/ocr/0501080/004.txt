"Lucumi Indiai."

Lucumi Indiai was one of Don Raul's slaves. He was from the town of Yorubaland,
faraway in Africa.

He gave Lucumi Indiai all the books about geography to hide them from his mother.
But this day, he was reading on the verandah.

Lito is sitting across the room from me, here. He is over there in the verandah.

In Cuba.

You can smell the food. Frijoles negros and fried plantains.

Dojia Elita stamped out into the verandah and took the book from my grandfather's hands.
She shredded it to pieces. My grandfather started to cry. I can still hear the tears falling on
the ground, ticking like Abuelito's clock.

Abuelito is silhouetted on Lito's forehead who is sitting in front of me in Cuba.

I don't know who Abuelitois. I think he was my nameless great grandfather, though I
thought that he was nameless. When he was born, the comadre was holding my great great
grandmother's hand. But this is like the lizard, it does not belong in this story.

So Abuelito hadaclock. It ticked. It ticked to the rhythm of tears falling from the
effort of reading. It ticked to the memory of those words erased by the tears falling from the
effort of reading. It ticked with the love of the tears falling from the cascade over the rocks.
My mother Ta had swallowed Abuelito's clock and it ticked inside of her. I used to hear it
when she fed me from her being.

My grandfather cried because Dofia Elita had taken his book and she had destroyed it.
The words were ripped apart. He later tried to glue it together and managed to make some
sense out of the book. Sometimes I think that that book is this story, that this story is but a
residue of those lost words. That in that book he lost his power to remember. He lost the
power to remember his own death.

He started running away from the house and he went to the slaves’ quarters to look for
Lucumi Indiai.

Lucumi Indiai had been shot by Don Raul. No reason, just anger. The books were
burnt.

So Lito just cried and had an asthma attack. He was heaving like a railroad, gasping
like a butterfly fluttering against a quinqué.

He was remembering his death.
