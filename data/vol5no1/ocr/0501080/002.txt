the memory of his own death my grandfather was born. Not until he remembered his death did
he realize that life was but one long remembering.

And what if you remember too late?

The terrain that you see out there, through the window, it belonged to my great
grandmother. The memory of her death still haunts me today. And that of her father, and her
father's mother. We don't remember how it came to be, that terrain. Some story of Spanish
settlers, generations ago. And that's why I have so many memories of Spain. Sometimes I
still dream of Spain. Somewhere in the Basque country. Others say that the terrain was
always there, that it had always belonged to us.

So the terrain is important to the story. Ihave never seen it, but you can see it there,
through the window, stretched out before you. It belonged to my great grandmother.

Sometimes when I go to bed, I cannot breathe. Asthma. And then I remember my
grandfather. He is breathing through me.

In the verandah, you can see him. Heisreadingabook. A fly is buzzing naggingly
near his cold lemonade. The sweat is falling from his forehead and blurs the words, as if tears
were falling from the effort. You can hear him breathing.

"Lito."

That's Dofia Elita calling my grandfather. You can see her inside the house looking
through the screen at my grandfather who is reading.

The house used to be modest. Two bedrooms with eight children piled into each of
them. They called Dofia Elita "la parida" because she had had so many children. Some were
twins though. Most died young. Some were from my great grandfather, who didn't have a

name.

When he was born, the comadre was holding my great great grandmother's hand. This
is not the beginning of the story though. And besides, this is not part of the story.

So the modest house, after my grandfather's death, became the terrain that you see
stretched out there. Huge. Only in death could it appear so big.

"Lito."
That's what they called him. I don't know why.
"Rafaelito."

My grandfather is the man that you see there in the verandah reading. If you listen
closely, you can hear him breathing.

Sometimes when I go to bed, I hear him breathing and then I cannot sleep.
