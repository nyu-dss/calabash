IN HEROES’ CIRCLE

Gaunt saints laid out on slabs, they sleep
in the nine o’clock sun. The benches

are coffin-narrow, made to keep

the homeless flock away. The stench

of loneliness ascends from their heap

of cast-offs -- styrofoam-boxed lunches,

cardboard sheets, cane trash, relics of hope:

a battered bag, dead coals, an empty cup.

I avert my eyes

from the sun-struck show of shame
as they rise like the dead and stretch
and turn as if at home

in the warmth of a love multiplied
by intimates in a private room,

or our new Jerusalem.
