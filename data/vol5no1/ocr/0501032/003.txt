becausen him chosen, but the wife don’t know that she gwine look back an wham! One __pilla
of coarse salt comin’ up.

Jonathan delivered the angel dialogue in exaggerated nasal tones with all accompanying
laughter and gestures and with one hand on the table.

Feima looked on in amazement. She was thinking more about the possibility of it being one of
those places they call oasis, than on the actual joke. Brother Jonathan stood up at the word
‘wham’ and slapped the shaky little table in tempo with the final words, as if he were playing a
game of dominoes. And from what she knew of domino playing it was a six-love kind of slap.
His blue turban with the yellow lead pencil standing up straight in it looked shaky like it was
about to come loose ...She drew a sharp breath.

‘I frighten you?’ he asked, suddenly solicitous, hand stretched out and step advancing. The next
thing he knew was that he was looking at the door handle and she was looking out at him
through the curtains and wood en louvres.

‘No’ really’, she breathed as he stepped off the wobbly boards.

A faint smell of essence hung in the air.

Feima could not decipher immediately the reason for the sense of unease that enveloped her.
Was it because of the jokes about angels, because a preacher talked ordinary or was it the
incense? However, she decided not to think too badly of Brother Jonathan’s efforts to entertain,
being no stranger to Dadda’s unrepentant and unholy jokes such as the one about Abel and his
navel made behind Mamma’s backl.

Peas-shelling in the yard was a big event that Jonathan looked forward to, for he had grown up
under the damp skirt-tail of the Blue Mountains with its —_ plantains and coconuts towering over
wet, grass-lined trails. He found himself fascinated with the communal attractions of big reaping,
as was the case with red peas, corn and cocoa depending on the season and the size of a farmer’s
holding here on the fringes of what they called the Cockpits. After the shelling, he had noticed in
his two-plus years of sojourn, dry pods were exposed longer to the sun, spread sometimes on a
barbecue of paved marl and stones before being stored in the butchery for re-planting. Corn he
already knew, required the husking of its trash while the thick fleshy protective husk of the cocoa
pod was chopped in half to let the grains and the sweet preserving water out. Everyone came to
their neighbour’s yard _—_ prepared with thin peeling knives which would be made to walk
skilfully between the tortuous bulbous ‘toes’ of the ginger. On healing mission trips to St.Ann he
had seen more pimento than locally where even children knew __ that atypically this crop was
reaped by ripping the branches off the trees in order to get hold of the pungent smelling seeds.
And just recently Shepherd Howland had been reminding the flock that no matter how much
MacDonald Almanac they tried, they could not make pigeon-gungo peas and sorrel arrive
together at any other time than at Christmas time. The young man thought he saw a budding
sermon on unity in the practices of lend-hand and day-work. Yes, people came unbidden from all
walks of life except of course the policeman, teacher and sanitary inspector who probably
thought it below their dignity to flop on dirt floors

No one showed any surprise when the affable Brother Jonathan showed up and pitched in, and
no one thought it strange that he wore black, for strange are the ways of God’s messengers who
traverse the land at night. At short notice they might find it absolutely imperative to cut language
and make sign to turn back rolling calf, or to transform into duppy conquerors. Who knows what
demons they have to face, or what angels — fallen or otherwise — they might have to wrestle with
till the break of day.

Willing hands worked far into the night. Naturally, sweet-wood was added to the fire instead of
the harsh burn-eye; refreshments were served and many stories went the rounds accompanied by
