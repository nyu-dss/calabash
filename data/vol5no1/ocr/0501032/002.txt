Shepherd Leader often looked proudly as his young charge led the women in his flock in
the expected ‘trup’ and ‘trump’, and the wheel and tu’n around the enchanted circle. Brother
Howland who ruled the Meetin’ House with a steadfast hand, was too busy healing the bruised
and broken-hearted, and handing out the expected little packets and vials without which no
self-respecting wearer of turban and robe would be accepted. After being acclimatised to the
desired codes of conduct, Brother Jonathan had gradually taken up the seemingly charming,
seemingly harmless habit of roaming all over adjoining neighbourhoods during the days, shaking
hands and cultivating goodwill. His flexibility did not go unnoticed when the Leyland unloaded
its precious cargo of farm workers returning from Uncle Sam Country. It was indeed a nice thing
to keep the religious fervour burning outside the be-flagged compound where glasses of holy
water perched atop tall posts. Jonathan, knowing he could turn up anywhere without invitation
and could make any utterance without earning a wrathful backlash, at times felt his head grow as
he embraced each new upsurge in his status.

The harvest will be good, he exulted.

It did not look suspicious for him not only to pass by Miss Etelda’s board house but to make a
stop while she was out attending to her husband’s business.
After all, in the district it was easier to trust a man of God than any other young man who might
smell and bleat like a rammy, and likewise could not be let loose just so among young
nanny-goats. A man of music could deceive them with sweet sounds and skill on the instrument.
Yes, it was easier to trust the young preacher with the ready smile than the self righteous police
officer flashing his prominent gold tooth wearing govament boot and riding govament horse
while the dumb creature fanned flies with its groomed tail. If you come to think of it, the man
who was most trustworthy was poor blind old Franko, roaming the earth in search of food to
sustain his meagre frame and of ears to hear him recite out of his repertoire of woe.
Brother Jonathan always politely cleared his throat on approaching through the khus-khus
patches which stood guard stiffly out there with their sharp-edged leaves between the Walsh
house and the dusty road. Moreover, he had long realised that the prize daughter was almost
always alone at home. Jonathan always delivered his hoarse laughter before asking Thank you
kindly for a drink of water, knowing that this well-mannered girl was going to serve him from
the jugful of rain water reserved for visitors on the side-board covered with an embroidered doily,
and in a glass tumbler rather than a plastic cup. He always encouraged her to sit across from him
at the little wooden table on the side veranda where her father ate his dinner, rather than stand
there holding the door and only putting her head out to smile. Feima was a bit puzzled as to
whether he reserved certain jokes to show that he was human, or freely dispensed others to put
listeners at their ease, but she had noticed for some time that the stories were not exactly
un-worldly.

Taken from a certain text about the two angels walking to Emmaus disguised as men, Brother
Jonathan’s local version that day assured her that in ‘bibical’ times, they appeared with alarming
regularity and familiarity. This time it was among people engaging in riotous living in some
desert somewhere on top of Africa. On this occasion ‘they’ were in fact talking with a twang and
laughing ‘kiffim kiffim’.

The two, he said, was walkin’ to a place call Gum Arrow where there happened to be a spring.
As they walked they was talkin’ up in they nose about them people livin’ bad life into one desert
them call Saddom who neva know they was comin’. So hear one, me will appear sudden in the
room altho’ the door shet, frighten them they wet they swaddlin’ clothes (because is swaddlin’
clothes them-they people used to wear you know), an’ the odder one say me will lead de deestant
family membas outside the town near the spring, becausen when fire-bun start the husban cool
