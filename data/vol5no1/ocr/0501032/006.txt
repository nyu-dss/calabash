A brief tussle ensued in a desperate resistance borne out by a strength she had not known before.
And she saw the look of astonishment as his foot _ slipped and the loss of balance eased him
effortlessly off the edge of her faithful little gully bank. He was holding on to a stodgy banana
plant and its six-hand bunch and, she thought ruefully, it gwine be a long fall down to that
bottomless pit where Mamma eleven breadfruit tree always holding hands. Before turning
her back, it crossed her mind fleetingly that when day light out, a muddy black turban might be
found under a flattened bunch of banana, and someone will be wondering out loud if the
messenger had lost his guard by taking in too big a tot of Dadda’s johncro’ rum ...

It was Sista Puncey who met her at the shed door coming back.

‘Miss Fee, a was jus’ comin’ back to help you clean up what rubbish lef’ out dere. You do
enough work fo’ tinight’.
Feima leaned a weary head on the rough post.
‘True. True. Tell Mamma fo’ me please, I goin’ to take a little lie down. My chest feel a little
tight’.
‘ITcan come with you, mam’. Puncey knew when respect was due.
‘Okay, youcan jus’ walk me to the door and tell Mamma what I say’.

Feima turned to watch Sista Puncey turn into the shed.
But she didn’t really see her.
