loud laughter. Meanwhile, the welcome guest who was also the Lord’s anointed and therefore
privileged to leave whenever the spirit bid, was served his fried fish, potato pone and bread first,
and ears picked up when his turn came to add to the repertoire of jokes.

Feima herself liked to stand a little in the shadows and watch the eyes glow as the fresh, friendly
grains rolled almost eagerly out of their pods in green and multi-coloured globules varying with
every grain and laughingly thrown with some skill into clean butter pans. One of the growing-up
stories she still felt a little awed about was how inquisitive spirits should be kept at bay, but not
by throwing water out inadvertently. The ancestors, those faithful protectors of navel-strings
planted under fruit trees — one for each child - were never too far away, and were even seen and
heard at certain times, she was made to believe.

Feima was out and about helping to serve and sharing in the fun but mostly in a non-verbal way.
Her remarkable eyes lit up often, particularly as she enjoyed wearing one of Mamma’s calico
apron-bibs with rick-rack braid outlining the pockets and listening to the squeals of the children
like Nadia and her friends who were given special privileges at peas-shelling every year, she
noticed. S he liked the idea of them being allowed to carouse disgracefully until the wee hours
even if there was school next day, and to participate in number games such as ‘ship sail, sail fast’
by guessing how many grains of roasted corn or peas the player held in the fist. This was an
occasion when children could temporarily acquire adult status, take liberties without penalty —
giving laugh for peas-soup, so to speak. This year Vester and Caro-Lou were playing big,
leaning forward with lower backs to the wall, hands on knees, eyes bright as peenie wallies.

Big People paused gleefully, tobacco pipes hanging from the lips of both men and women, to
acknowledge that it was those worms which came tailor-made inside the pods that made the
greatest impact on the young ones like the Dixon twins. How they got into the sealed pods was a
question without an answer, and every year brought the same results. All eyes turned on Nadia
who this year must either brazenly decide to shed the fear of the little wrigglers or end up being
laughed at especially by Vester who had long passed that stage. Valda and Vinny were getting
ready to show-off on her by flapping and screeching around the out-house like owls well hidden
in the tall night trees asking “whoo-whoo?’

At such times Mr. Walsh was in his element. The good nature that was hiding under that cap
pulled down as if to hide his eyes got a chance to shine. He it was who held out a broad fleshy
palm with a worm that had been pulled with some effort from a half-eaten grain. It was a
moment of stillness as some craned necks to watch this show. This particular caterpillar

tinged with black was not the usual plain common green specimen. Small hairy spikes on its
back complemented by a shiny beak and beady eyes. Feima noted carefully that when Dadda
nudged, it bucked and reared its middle, then flattened and reared again, pushing itself along his
palm like a dwarf locomotive. Voices screamed when it almost fell off.

Feima knew that Dadda’s balding pate was being seen for the first time by many who never
guessed what it looked like in daylight. It shone in the light of the lanterns hanging on pegs
nailed around the planks of mahoe for those who recalled only hearing him mumble ‘mawnin’ on
the dawn road as he towered over them on his faithful Dinah. His eyes were shining too and his
voice touched the children now with unaccustomed warmth.

‘Look good’, he cooed, ‘it a little vex but will never bite. Won’t bite you now nor never. It gat
no teeth. De mout too feeble fe hol’ on to flesh, see?’

He held out his large hand again as smaller ones reached out tentatively. Pulled back. Reached
