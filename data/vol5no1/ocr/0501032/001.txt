BROTHER JONATHAN

Mamma was never going to know what almost happened the night the peas-shelling was taking
place in the out-shed out of sight of all those adults and children who wished her so well and
thought she was so safe, so untouchable. It had happened within hearing but no one in the noisy,
happy throng heard anything above the chatter and banter. It had happened within hearing but
there was nothing to hear, for his whispering was hoarse, and her throat had tightened like the
rope around the neck of a tethered goat caught in a thicket. And the girl shook her head and
marvelled once again how close she had come to having her maiden run down her legs in thin
pink streaks as the whisperers had averred, but more, how unaware a careful mother really was
of any young girl’s dilemma, all along!

Brother Jonathan was a nice up-and-coming young man who had gained much awe and respect
from the villagers, especially after he had donned the revivalist head-wrap which identified him
as a Child of God and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven. Walk the length and breadth of
the district and you find young men willing to live a life of irresponsibility. Theirs was a
precarious life, roving around the village, catching young girls who dropped ripe under any fruit
tree, arriving just when the pot is lifted off the three firestones and slapping empty back pockets
in raucous laughter. Hanging on eye-top — everyone knows if you blink, they drop bouf.

Brother Jonathan was a living exception to the rule. Always clean and neat, he was expected to
save sinners and was naturally welcome at mealtime.

No one could rightly recall whence he came or how long since he had blended in so quietly.
What they knew was that ready laughter which crinkled the corners of his dreamy eyes, and that
friendly approach to one and all alike. The night preaching and the sankey singing with its
attendant houn’ing had surely brought a delicious and appealing hoarseness to his throat. Big
People, many of whom regularly attended the lively, gut-wrenching and soul-stirring sessions
without sanction of their regular church parsons, reported on his prowess on the central threshing
floor where the sins of the faithful are mercilessly trampled in the ancestral three-step. Not
hampered by pain-a-joint, his agility in jumping off the podium had become something of a
legend; being a pleasant, agile and not least, a good looking male, he gradually came to be
pampered by the matronly figures who handed him culinary delights under the anonymity of
gowns and wraps and dish towels embroidered in coloured threads.
