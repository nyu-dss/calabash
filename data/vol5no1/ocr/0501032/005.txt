again. Giggles spilled over into the respectful silence. Hands covered mouths, then a brave one:
Gi me, put it in me han-middle. Me no ‘fraid’.

The man gently tilted the bewildered creature onto the little palm, and hastened to reassure:
‘Same thing with lizad !’

But a shout of disbelief rose at the mention of lizard, and the caterpillar holder was suddenly left
to his own devices as Dadda’s voice to include all.

‘A lizard wi aswayl a-run from you. Him won’t run after yu. So tell me now, what sense it make
running from somet’ing dat running from yu? Tell me dat!’, he ended triumphantly.

Even the oldsters were by then nodding agreement, murmuring

‘Fi true, fi true’.

Refreshments arrived then, and general laughter and goodwill prevailed.

The peas shelling resumed with renewed enthusiasm as Feima was returning
to the kitchen holding an almost empty tray. She met up with = Sister Puncey, Miss Meemie
and Cousin Jumima - _ the last of the frying and the sharing and the pouring and the washing-up
brigade - who had just left the kitchen to re-enter the fray, but now more to match wits than to
partake of the job in hand. Feima was putting one hand out towards the kitchen door when
someone grabbed it before she could open her mouth to say ‘a-who’. Suddenly she found herself
jacked up, as the common phrase and matching sentiment implied, against the wattle and daub
on the far side. She saw the black turban before hot breath brushed her face. Her eyes touched
the tray lying upturned on the grass where it had fallen with a muffled sound then moved to the
darker patch under the arm of the black sleeve now restricting any movement of her head. Black
as sin, her mind screamed, but her mouth opened and closed wordlessly as he flung his body at
hers in order to pin her more firmly against the rough surface. Feima stiffened a little as she felt
his hardness against her leg and resolved almost without thinking to clean the spot extra that
night and rub it with bay rum or jeyes during ablutions which she would now necessarily have to
repeat.

“You father not gwine turn me down. He know I decent enough for him son-in-law’.

His breath came hotter with the urgency, and at last, in the half-light, she looked into the whites
of his eyes. His other hand moved across her breast. As she gazed at the raw hunger she felt a
sense of light-headedness because that raw hunger had somehow freed her from the numbing
fear that had threatened to engulf her only a moment ago. And in that moment when she
experienced the relaxation of a triumph, he assumed he had won her will.

‘I will care you good’, he said, half turning toward a row of shrubbery.
‘Good like you parents them. Them love you one way, but me love you anodder way so you can
to leave them and cleave unto me. The Good Book say so’
Feima reluctantly followed.

‘A notice you not sayin’ anything’ he whispered, head half turned toward her. ‘If you doubt me,
a can show you the half acre I pay down on. Fe buil’ me own little meet’n house...’

‘Come’, he said throatily, leading her to the deeper shadows. Suggestively, in the custom of the
roving brigade, he tickled her palm. The effect was that he unwittingly lightened the pressure on
the fingers of the hand he still held captive, as he moved.
