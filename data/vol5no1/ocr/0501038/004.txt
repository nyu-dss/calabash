bald-headed baby begins to wail. There is a movement towards the cot by the overweight nurse.
Lisa looks at her with contempt.

Lisa’s knees feel like rubber. She turns back to face the doctor and is seized by an
overwhelming nausea. Hug me, she thinks wildly. She imagines herself collapsing helplessly in a
sobbing ball at his feet. In a heartbeat, she thinks to herself. She would launch herself at his feet,
if that would help, if that action would save her child’s life.

His beeper goes off. He retrieves the machine from his waist and frowningly examines it
before replacing it. He does not excuse himself, which is a relief for Lisa, who inexplicably feels
the need for propinquity with him in that moment. She wants to peel off his skin and burrow
inside him. She watches him go over the chart and tries to communicate telepathically. /’m alone

ever tells you how hard it is with a child, especially a sick one, Lisa thinks, wishing she had been
raised with faith so that she could pray now. It was as if there was some conspiracy of silence
about the difficulty, even with other parents of chronically- and terminally-ill children, in the
same way that it was with women who’d had children and were reluctant to tell the truth about
the real pain of childbirth or that pregnancy often made a woman horny, endlessly dreaming sex
dreams of penises, penises and more penises.

Lisa tries to throw up in a corner of the recently mowed front lawn and then, when she is
unable to, goes and sits on a concrete bench under a tree, staring at a bug march up the side of

the tree trunk, the dappled mid-morning sun’s rays warm against her face. There are many
