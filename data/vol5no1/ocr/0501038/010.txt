It reminds her of the days when she was desirable, when she had lovers, and she would call them
teasing that she was naked beneath her clothes and she was touching herself, thinking of them.
She pauses to steady herself, her secret furled deep within her like a prayer. The day has begun
to really heat up, she thinks, glancing down at her blouse moist with perspiration.

At the sliding glass entrance, she bumps into the baby’s doctor.

“Mrs Stanton,” he says, a concerned frown creasing his brow. “We were wondering
where you’d got to. Are you all right?”

“Yes. I’m fine, Doctor. I just needed, I needed some fresh air.”

“Oh. Well, let’s go up to see your daughter.” He lightly touches her hand, propels her
through the lobby that is bright with crystal sunshine, oversized potted plants and shiny marble
floors, to the elevator that will take them up to the children’s ward.

As they stand side by side, quietly staring up at the lighted buttons of the lift that is coming down,
Lisa suddenly remembers what his first initial stands for, the J, and the recollection of the elusive
Christian name brings her more satisfaction than anything else that has happened to her in a long
while. Lisa repeats the name in her head like a mantra, feeling her throat tighten inexplicably in
relief. She closes her eyes and breathes in deeply, breathing the name softly on her lips. She can
feel the doctor standing there beside her. All around her, she is aware of people rushing about,

the sick and the un-sick—mortals—their murmured words a blur, rising up like some strange and

wonderful force field.
