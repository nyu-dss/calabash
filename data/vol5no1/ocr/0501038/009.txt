She stops.

He stops dead, too, looks up, slack-jawed. She smiles at him. She has not been with a
man in more than a year; her smile is meant to inspire desire despite the awkward surrounding
circumstances. She hopes it does. Unable to stop herself now, she hikes her skirt—what is she
doing ?—revealing her crotch with its untamed bush.

She hears the now familiar strangled sound issue again from some hidden part of him,
and her eyes boldly travel to the front of his pants, which she sees has formed an appreciative
tent. And suddenly she is glad he is unable to speak. Glad that in spite of this, he can
nevertheless be made to understand.

It takes less than two minutes before she is down on all fours—her dun pleated skirt
bunched up around her waist. He kneels before her. Nothing matters now—not the dead mother,
or the child lying inside the sick children’s ward, the goddamned husband who himself had
puked the first time he smelt the baby’s puke, and then moved out, not the fact that she has no
money left for this go-round of hospital fees and medication and whatnot—except that there is a
strange man inside her so that all she can feel inside her is him. In this one little thing, she at
least has complete control.

She pushes him down on his back and straddles him, impaling herself on his rigid cock.
His shirt is ringed with the sweat stains of one who labours for many hours beneath the sun; she
peels it off and flings it as far away from them as she can. He is young, she decides—twenties,
maybe—solid. She can see now that what she thought to be flab is actually muscle. His eyes are
glazed with excitement and fear, his slack mouth reveals crooked yellowed teeth.

Her face is flushed; an angry vein has appeared in the centre of her forehead and her
nostrils are flaring. For a while, all she can hear is the sound of their laboured breathing, and a
strange voice interrupting, urging, Faster, faster, faster, faster.

She does not recognise the sound of her own angry voice.

After, she vomits again. Then she adjusts her hair, and examines her knees where the
earth has bruised them. She looks at him, the deaf-mute, dazed, his pants bundled around his
ankles, and sees it had been a new and not unpleasant experience for him. She imagines him
thinking about her later that night in his bed, and knows she will absolutely not want him again.

She re-emerges into the brilliance of the day, a pulse at her throat throbbing like

something that’s about to explode. Beneath the fabric of her skirt, her nakedness feels exquisite.
