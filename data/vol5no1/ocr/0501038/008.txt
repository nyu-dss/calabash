befallen their family, she couldn’t help finding something morbidly compelling about sickness
and disability. Their eyes held for a few seconds before she felt Steven put a protective arm
around her. Then, he’d still had a protective arm for her. “Is it safe to have that guy here, on the
ward with the children?” Steven had whispered to the doctor when he’d moved down the hall.
“He’s kind of creepy.”

Lisa looks at the deaf-mute now and realises that she cannot estimate his age—it could be
anywhere between late teens and thirties. He is dressed in khaki and water boots and carrying a
coiled-up garden hose. His fleshy lips are hanging open, the way they had that night she’d first
seen him on the ward. She wonders if he remembers her. Probably not, she thinks. Possibly he’s
retarded as well. No sooner is the thought out than she feels ashamed for having thought it in the
first place. Her mind runs back on the nurse on the ward that she’d judged as fat. When did she
become so mean?

She is frightened by a sound he makes in his throat.

‘Oh,’ Lisa says, and, filled with a reckless daring, empties the rest of her bladder.

He mutters something unintelligible again in his deaf-mute way, and backs away.

Lisa knows the incongruous picture she must have made with her serious hairstyle and
dignified clothes, the sensible pleated skirt hiked up above her knees, squatting down above the
high, vomit-sprayed grass like a Vietnamese peasant, the seat of her pants pulled aside by her
finger, pee splashing against the sides of her sensible tan shoes. But in that instant, she doesn’t
care. The seat of her pants has gotten partially wet, too, she notices when she is finished. She
pulls them down, wads them up and stuffs them into her handbag. He probably hasn’t computed
any of it, she tells herself. She takes out a square of Kleenex from the mini pack she keeps handy
in her purse, dabs at herself before reaching down to dab at the leather of her shoes ruined by
urine splash. “God,” she says aloud. She tosses away the tissue, looks around. “God,” she says
again.

When she finds him he is attaching the hose to a standpipe. From where she stands she can smell
the rank odour of sweat in his clothes.

She approaches, her heart beating erratically. She feels awkward, as if she is just learning
to walk; it has been a while since she has seduced anyone. She must tread carefully, she decides,

she cannot spook him. Above, a bird alights from a tree, wings flapping, startling her.
