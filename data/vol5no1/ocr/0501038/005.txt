benches like this one, scattered all across the grounds. To help family members compose their
thoughts about the reality of loved ones’ health circumstances, she imagines. She notices a man
and woman seated on a nearby bench beneath another tree. The man has his hand around the
slender slumped shoulders of the woman who is staring blankly into space.

Lisa looks away. Never has she felt so much like an orphan. She can hear the sound of
traffic in the street, the world going on without a care for her problems. To take her mind off her
isolation in the world, she thinks about her mother, who’d died in the first year she and Steven
had been married. This is not a good idea, she soon realises. Her dead mother only serves to
remind her that she is alone. Lisa is not in touch with her father, who had been married to
someone else when Lisa was born, and had subsequently never taken an active role in his
daughter’s life. A divinity student from a prominent Westmoreland family, he’d dumped Lisa’s
mother, the secretary at the Bible College with whom he’d been having an affair for almost two
years, after Lisa had been born. His family’s lawyers had discreetly arranged for a generous
monthly maintenance package for the child, with the stipulated condition that public
acknowledgment of the identity of the father of their illegitimate grandchild was never to be.
Who was there to tell? Lisa’s mother had no other living relatives. She’d found another
secretarial job after she had the baby, and had devoted herself to Lisa’s welfare and happiness,
raising her as though they were sisters. They’d even double-dated a few times, in Lisa’s teenage
years. Lisa’s friends had all been amazed at the unconventionality of their relationship. They
spoke openly and honestly about sex with each other. Because of her bad experience with Lisa’s
father, Lisa’s mother had wanted her daughter to give her virginity to a man completely worthy
of her. And Lisa had waited until she’d finished high school to have her first sexual encounter.

Lisa feels the familiar dull ache now in her breast as she thinks about how desperately
she wishes she could speak to her mother even once more. Her mother, the former festival queen
who drew swarms of men buzzing to her wherever she went, who had been so young looking
still and so seemingly in good health—her lung cancer diagnosis (she’d never smoked) a week
before her death by a sudden stroke that felled her one morning, on her way to do further tests at
the National Chest hospital. Her death had been a devastating blow to Lisa, who’d imagined her
mother being around to enjoy the arrival of the grandchildren she’d anxiously anticipated from
the day she’d walked Lisa down the aisle. Although, in retrospect, Lisa remembered the strange

persistent cough that had weakened her mother for weeks, months maybe, before she died.
