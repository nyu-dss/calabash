line. He has adenoids. “What’s back’?

“Tt’s the baby,” Lisa explains. “It’s back.”

There’s silence. Then: “Oh. Christ.” He expels a long frustrated sigh. “Where are you?
Well, look, I’m in the middle of something here,” he says. “I have to call you back. This evening,
okay?”

She hangs up before he does, knowing what he’s thinking. He is thinking she is using the
baby’s sickness as leverage for him to come back home. There is a hurricane of emotions
swirling around inside her, feelings she is unable to express. She gets up and wanders back
towards the building but at the sliding glass door, changes her mind. The thought of going back
inside there with the sickening hospital smell of antiseptic makes her want to retch again, and so
urgent does the need to pee become, that she hurries around the side of the building instead.

The hospital’s grounds are huge. She remembers seeing it first on a brochure someone
from her workplace had handed her. She remembers thinking that surely the baby would be

remembers seeing him on the children’s ward, the first go-round with the baby, with his mops
and other accoutrements. They had on occasion exchanged looks—there was one time Lisa
noticed something in his eyes. Steven had noticed it too. They had been on the ward,
conferencing to the on-call doctor one night, when he’d come up the hall, noisily dragging his
roller bucket with the squeaky wheels, dirty water sloshing out over the sides. The baby had just
been diagnosed; they’d been keeping vigil beside her cot every night.

Lisa had looked up, her eyes bloodshot and red-rimmed from crying, and had seen him in
the hallway, staring at her, his mouth half-open in his deaf-mute gape. She could tell then,
simply by looking at him, that something was wrong developmentally with him. Lisa knew it

was impolite to stare but she was unable to drag her eyes away. In light of the tragedy that had
