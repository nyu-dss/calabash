Lisa realises, avoiding looking at her. Lisa’s mind wanders listlessly, then, at how his words
sound almost like an admission—though of what, she is uncertain. It can’t be of guilt. She’s the
guilty one; she is convinced that she’s the one responsible for passing along the sickness from in
the womb.

The doctor is a slightly built, light-skinned man with a slight stoop, sloping shoulders and
a smattering of freckles across his nose and cheeks. Lisa thinks it is funny for a black person,
regardless of the lightness of hue, to have freckles. Even now, staring at his thinning widow’s
peak, she has a sudden urge to giggle. We’re all going to die, she thinks, and the thought makes
her queasy. Beads of sweat erupt on her forehead.

A fat nurse waddles by, in her too-tight uniform, her pudgy, white-stocking’d legs
rubbing together noisily with an intense hissing sound that made it seem strangely as though her
intent were to start a fire. Overweight, Lisa mentally corrects herself. ‘Overweight’ is the
politically correct term that’s used now. Lisa herself has always been slender. She’s actually
quite skinny now— emaciated really; she’s stopped eating again, and losing weight rapidly since
the baby has taken a turn for the worse. The nurse gives Lisa a tight, sympathetic smile, her
chins wobbling, and Lisa, who is unable to look away from her, feels somehow exposed,
diminished by this fat woman who perhaps has perfect — normal — children of her own.

To take her mind off the spiteful feelings brewing within her about the nurse, Lisa
focuses her attention on the doctor. He is one of the best paediatric oncologists in the Caribbean.
Lisa sees his nameplate through a sudden blur of tears. Dr J Paul Mountbatten. Mountbatten, she
thinks inconsequentially, as if it’s the first time she’s being made aware of it. J Paul Mountbatten.
A regal name. Isn’t the Queen a descendant of some Mountbattens or other? And what about his
Christian name? Is the J for John? No, it wasn’t something that common. She’s heard a colleague
of his, a well-preserved doctor in her late forties, maybe, call him by his first name one day in
greeting. Something Spanish? What was it again? J ought to know my child’s doctor’s first name,
she thinks angrily.

The doctor is still speaking, flipping through the baby’s charts, as if for an answer to
some unknown question. Lisa feels inexplicably offended by this action. The tears that had been
gathering in her eyes and in the back of her throat a moment ago have evaporated. Look at me!
she wants to scream at him. Look at me! Why are you telling me this? Why? Why? Why?

In a corner of the ward, which is painted in a soothing, neutral light yellow, a
