remission, so an allogeneic stem cell transplant can be performed. The outlook, as we’ve
discussed before, is not the best. Whatever happens, though, you should know, we’re in for the
long haul.”

That’s it, then. He is sorry. It’s over? Lisa feels slightly confused. What is he saying’? She
feels like a child, unable to comprehend, though she feels fairly certain she should, and she
decides she will not ask him to explain. She feels exhausted. She wants to lie down somewhere,
curl up and go to sleep.

No one looking at her could guess how exhausted she is. She is still fairly young (early
thirties), still good-looking, despite her increasingly plodding gait that accompanies the
ever-increasing weary sighs she finds she emits now, as though she were someone old and not
particularly attractive. The fact is, however, Lisa feels hugely unattractive when she looks at
herself in the mirror. “Who will love me again?” she sometimes says out loud to her reflection,
staring into eyes that are often bloodshot and have dark smudges beneath them. She keeps a tube
of concealer in her medicine chest for the express purpose of covering the circles; it’s the only
make-up she ever uses now. And as she peers some more at the face she hardly recognises now,
she makes other unpleasant discoveries: for one, her cheekbones seem too exaggerated, too
pronounced for her now gaunt face, as though they belong to someone else. Oh, they would be
perfect for some anorexic runway model, but for her, they’re too severe, endowing her somehow
with the look of a fierce-eyed savage. But even worse was her discovery about her shape. Her
post-pregnancy body with its luscious, womanly curves — the boobs, the accentuated hips — with
which she’d fallen in love, and with which Steven had first seemed besotted, had all but
disappeared. Her hair is brushed back severely into a neat bun, from which not one loose strand
of hair had escaped. She is prophylactically dressed. In her high-necked, ruffled pink Victorian
blouse, knee-length dun coloured pleated skirt whose waist is now too loose, and sensible tan
pumps, she looks not so much like a believer, which she no longer is. Otherwise, she could have
been mistaken for an old-fashioned woman dressed for work, at some government office,
perhaps. But Lisa no longer works; she quit her job after the baby’s sickness reappeared.

She stands looking at the child—her child—almost serenely, and brushes a hand against
the baby’s feeble arm and offers it a small, placating smile before turning away from the look of
simultaneous hope and dismay clouding its eyes, bright with torment.

It’s a setback, of course, the doctor continues, staring at the baby’s chart, and by so doing,
