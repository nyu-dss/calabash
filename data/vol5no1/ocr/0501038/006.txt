They’d supposed the cough had been a residual effect of a lingering flu that had developed into a
bronchial infection. Lisa had experienced a crippling sense of loss and abandonment that entire
first year of her marriage, leaning against Steven, her intelligent and supportive husband, for
emotional support. For two weeks after her mother’s funeral Lisa had stayed home in bed, too
depressed to face the world, beseeching Steven to take time off his job to stay at home with her
and hold her.

What comes after, Lisa asks herself now, when emptiness is all that’s left? “Let go, and

goodwill—

She stops herself, horrified to realise that she’s already begun to think about the baby as
if it’s all over.

She pulls out her cell phone and dials her husband—the husband who has left her, left
their baby, because he couldn’t “stand the smell of sickness”.

“Yes, Lisa,” Steven answers wearily, on the fourth ring, right before voice mail chips in.

“Steven,” she says without preamble. Her throat tightens up. She remembers about focal
points from her days at Lamaze classes and pictures Steven holding her hand, there in the
delivery room. “It’s back.”

“What?” She can hear him breathing noisily through his mouth on the other end of the
