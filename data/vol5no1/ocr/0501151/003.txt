came to this island [...] no one talked to me. Everyone was furious at Roy for bringing home a
white woman.” p. 139), the latter by the rich of the hills, blacks or whites (“Sad, lonely Mama.
[...]. Not once had her home been selected to host a cocktail party. Not once had any of her
‘friends’ dropped by to visit her.” p. 146).

Gloria is the central intelligence through which events and memories are processed and
filtered. Through her we meet all the other characters and get to hear their stories. All will go
through a transformation in the course of the novel. The River ’s Song, therefore, is a
bildgunsroman — a coming-of-age story of a young girl — but it is also a psychological novel
where ail characters’ motivations and feelings, not only Gloria’s, have greater importance than
outside events. With the exception of Rafael, perhaps, all other characters undergo an inner
change; each of them will have to cope with disillusions and losses, endure psychological
turmoils that will change their lives or their outlook on life forever.

Struggling to survive amidst constricting relationships and burdensome ties Gloria
appears to be the love object of her mother, of her closest friend Annie, of her boyfriend Rafael.
In truth, rather than being the object of love, she is, for those who claim they love her, a sort of
talisman, a modal object that could help them get what they really want. Only by keeping her
hold on Gloria could her mother fulfill her own frustrated desires — graduating from All Saints
and moving up in the hierarchy of the Kingston social circle; only by maintaining her hold over
Gloria could Annie have her dreams come true — a college life together in Canada (never openly
disclosed is a delicate hint at Annie’s possible homosexuality); only by keeping his hold on
Gloria, could Rafael— who wants a “woman who will never change” — achieve the life his
mother had planned for him.

Torn between past and future, stuck in a present that is often determined by others, Gloria
will have to make difficult decisions to be free to determine the course of her life on her own.
The feeling of uncanniness, of the Freudian Unheimliche, will only be dispelled at the end of the
novel, when the mermaid will be revealed as a sad and benign creature, afraid of humans, yet
capable of granting people their “heart’s desire.” Finally, like the river-maid Dora, the mermaid
whose presence we felt throughout the narration, Gloria will be able to sing “her song of
individual dreams.”

Following her muse, Ms. Bishop proves herself a perceptive artist, capable of stirring
emotions without losing control of her writer’s tools, finely building a story and navigating with

a sure hand at the helm of her creation.
