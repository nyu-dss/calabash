inevitability and destiny, but also, as Gloria, the narrator, will prove, of individual determination.

Her story unfolds amidst daily chores, events of the tenement, and legends of old times —
the “notorious sabonsan, hairy monster with large blood-red eyes,” and the “dreadful
rivermumma’” who is said to entice little girls to “comb her long green hair and sing with her at
night, luring other girls to their deaths.”

The perturbing, or uncanny, effect, experienced by the reader on the opening page, is
reinforced and sustained by the introduction of the figure of the double?

The double here is a mythical figure, dominated by opposite passions and desires; a being
with the dual nature of woman and fish; a creature who must make a choice, knowing all too
well that whatever road she takes she will long for the other.

This is the fate of the mermaid. Mermaids are present in many Caribbean women writers’
poetry and fiction. They might be portrayed as terrifying creatures with “moss-green hair’ trying
to take their daughters to their “watery kingdom at the bottom of the river,” but also as poetic
muses, or vengeful and protective mothers — as in Ms. Bishop’s previously published poetry
book, Fauna, and specifically in the poems “Calling me back Home” and “Xaimaca”.

In The River’s Song the double nature of the mermaid becomes central, strengthening
the feeling of the uncanny throughout the novel, and standing for all that is hidden and uncertain,
both familiar and frightening, comely yet horrific, and also representing Gloria’s own double, as
she stands at the crossroads of her future life.

There are various dual combinations of characters who think alike, feel alike or are
juxtaposed one against the other as through a looking glass, and who are connected through a
series of images and references: Gloria and Annie, Gloria and her mother, Annie’s family and
Gloria’s family, Gloria and Rafael.

Ethnic, social and socio-economical differences serve as background to Gloria’s and
Annie’s troubled relationship. These complex and challenging issues are dealt with delicacy yet
sheer clarity. Ms. Bishop explores such issues as class and color, the clash between the haves and
have-nots, the nouveau riche and those of old money, setting up events and showdowns in
parallel forms, once again resorting to the phenomenon of the double. The mermaid’s feeling of
not belonging, her sense of alienation, solitude and isolation is mirrored in the Annie’s
mother/Gloria’s mother pair. They both long or longed for acceptance, and often faced rejection:

The first by both Kingston black high-class society and the “home-grown whites” (“When I first

> According to Freud, the uncanny feeling is often a combination of intellectual uncertainty and the phenomenon of the double.
