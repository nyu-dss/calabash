THE RIVER’S SONG

A feeling of uncertainty and a sense of foreboding — of some unknown, impending danger —
seizes the reader of The River ’s Song right from the first lines of its opening page and never lets
up until its last. What the reader experiences early in Jacqueline Bishop’s delicious debut
page-turner is best defined by the term Unheimliche, or the uncanny. The uncanny effect has
been described by Sigmund Freud in his essay Das Unheimliche as something leading to a “state
of complete bewilderment,” a sense of intellectual uncertainty, the feeling that a familiar scene
might hide, beneath its tranquil surface “something which ought to have remained hidden but has
come to light.” It is, in short, the “horror of the familiar.”’

Questions begin to mount in one’s mind while reading these opening lines. Who is the
narrator? Who is Annie? How is she related to the narrator?

None of these questions would remain open for too long, but right after quickly flipping
the page looking for some answers you’re taken back to the past through the use of time-shift.

From the somber and disquieting beginning, dominated by silence and sorrow, you are
transported to a place full of joyous “sounds of early morning coming into the house through the
jalousie windows,” a place where the dark-blue mountains — the blueprint of Kingston — come
into view, casting a spell over the narrative, the narrator, and also the reader.

Shortly, you meet the characters the narrator will have to say goodbye to: a coterie of
friends, neighbors, relatives who live around the “tenement yard.” And you notice the repetitive

use of the term wi//, and realize it has a structural importance: not only stressing the idea of

' “The uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar.”
