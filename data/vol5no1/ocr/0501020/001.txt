ALL SOUL’S DAYDREAM

I wake up bleeding

As if torn by coral

You make my bed hard

Since the day you began sinking your teeth into me
I have no peace

I will search where you sleep
I will find where you leave your skin each night
To fill your empty carcass with salt

I would love to see your dry up
What will you do when you see me inside your old clothes?
Will you skin me like a goat?

You don’t want to tell me where you live

Your spirit is wet

You speak with a Spanish accent

I know you come from a place far from our island
In the continent beyond the seas

You scream when you call me your child
My bones in one place, my heart in another
You sell your mother at a good price

For her to work in a foreign land

Since my boat left, you’ ve forgotten me

Make me a punch

The way I always liked

Nutmeg on Cocoa rum
Cinnamon, vanilla, sugar, honey
Call me when you drink the cup
I will come to you sweetly

I won’t scare you then

When I sleep tonight

I will dream of waking up early to follow you
Under the waters to your home

I will learn you name

As I pour the drink
On your tombstone
