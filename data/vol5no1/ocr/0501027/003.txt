The clear mirror of multiple identities
fuses my father and me

(he has sword never to leave El Cibao
I continue to bring him in the memory)

He takes off his left shoe

uncovers the place where before

his longest toe united us

it has been amputated to save his life
I grab the simile

I know why this memory is coming
Meager dark flesh

on which I travel to New Jersey

Something starts to disperse

spills over

inundates the apartments

where dream makers live

I leave knowing where I am going

I learn to walk with sandals

holding onto my absent father’s arm
Vulnerable

raw flesh we love each other even more

I find myself in the streets of New Jersey
Then go back home
—home invented between nostalgia and forgiveness—
Here I plant the memories
my son will invent later on
Allen Ginsberg’s phantom comes to visit my garden
the good poet even dares to question me
I smile
and read a poem that speaks of return
juggler return like the one of Li- Young-Lee
We both know how to travel on a back
wide
robust (despite time)
We both know the secret of the meager dark flesh
rotten meat that keep us vital
We are voices that know where silence comes from
Voices that rise across time
We the children of memory
Travelers with roots
Travelers with roots
Travelers with roots
Travelers with roots
inventors of memories
