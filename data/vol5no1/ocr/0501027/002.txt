embroider new images

on the cloth where my father inscribed
factory

sweat
invisibility
ham and cheese
ham and cheese
ham and cheese
ham and cheese...

I continue embroidering as if I were not doing anything
Allen Ginsberg and I face-to-face

nothing separates us now

we speak the same language

I read to him a desolation poem

he smiles with imperfect teeth

We are comrade Allen and I

On the other corner

Imposing

powerful Dofia Aida embroiders my name
so everybody knows that I have arrived
so I remember it

Solitude feels heavy

My father arrives from the factory lost in sweat
He comes reciting a poem

reclaiming Manhattanâ€™s streets

The streets of any town I walk

He is holding me by the hand

Iam no sure if it is he

Or is you

Whom! profoundly love right now Allen

Why do I mess with the memory

my father dissolved?

Ham and cheese I was saying

Ham and cheese

(four years in a row)

Invisible

While I learned how to write my name

I come holding the hand of Allen Ginsberg

hand of my father

hand of Dofia Aida

my hand

embroidering on the wide cloth of this country that spills over
so used to borrowed clothes
