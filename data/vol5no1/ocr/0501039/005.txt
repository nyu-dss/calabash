police officers loading bags of green ganja plants onto the vehicle. I guess in a country where
madness ruled, the entire scene made perfect sense. |The scene jolted me back to the school
where my Principal was shot. Students were poor and rough and routinely joined gangs with
names such as the FADALESS CREW, SHOTANKILL CREW, NAH LIVE FI NUTTEN
CREW, DONE DEAD A'READY CREW, SLAUGHTER HOUSE CREW, BULLET CREW.
One of the older teachers had explained that members of the Fadaless Crew either were raised
without fathers or their fathers had been murdered. No girls could join, and they were angry,
and some people said they had guns. The Shotankill Crew had male and female members
whose parents had been shot and killed in cold blood. When they filled out application forms
and were asked for information on parents they wrote: Shot and killed. The word deceased was
far too tame and told no story. They too were angry and wanted justice. Nah Live Fi Nutten
was negative. They were unemployed, unemployable and felt that the most extraordinary thing to
do was make "duppies" by killing people. Done Dead A'ready members were fatalistic. They
had nothing to live for so the rest of the world had to keep out of the way. Some crew members
carried guns and dealt in vengeance.

I rubbed my eyes and looked again as the two cops finished loading the bags. I, Fly,
realized that this was another kind of crew that would need its own name.

I moved away from the window just in time to answer a knock on the bedroom door. As I
opened the door, Miss Prudence greeted me with a mug of aromatic, high-mountain, country
coffee.

"Thank you, Miss Prudence, this smells good."

She turned to go but then she spun around, gave me a quizzical look and asked me point
blank, if I'd seen a van outside the window.

"Listen, Miss Prudence, I have lived on this island long enough to know how to see and not
see at the same time. I, Fly, may spy, but I also know how to stay out of people's business."
After she departed, I put down the coffee mug, picked up my bag and went out on the main road

to see if I could spy Nurse, Mrs. Banton, or even my principal.
