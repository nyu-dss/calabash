stand-pipe force, from a rock. I wet myself washing my face and then with hands behind my
back, I bent under, opened my mouth and allowed the brackish water to fill my being. I
swallowed and stopped when my stomach neared bursting point. It was mineral water. If the
water is as powerful as they say, then healing will take place in me.

When I heard the sounds of living things, I peered through a thicket of gungo peas and saw
an enclosure with animals and birds that shared the same pen. All the animals were mixed up.
Pigs walked with goats, with a couple of cows, the one donkey, a sheep, the chickens. The
