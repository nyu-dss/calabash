remember where I lived, became like a small child again, sang nursery songs and wondered why
I couldn't find Nurse and Mrs. Banton nor they me. I revisited the Boulevard. I passed by the
school and bawled out the dead principal's name and the new security guard drew his gun on me.

In the streets I approached a little girl and her mother and the little girl said "hello."

Before I could answer the â€” child's mother jerked her away.

"Don't ah tell yuh not to talk to him."

"Yes, Mummy, but why not?

"He's a mad man. Used to be a teacher."

The mother threatened to call the district constable and I hurried away.

All day long I walked, kicking the loose stones and the dirt with them. I climbed over a
shrub-covered hill and then the land unexpectedly leveled and opened wide with about an acre of
the greenest guinea grass I'd ever seen. I raised my feet high and moved through tall, thick

broad-leaved bananas, different from the green of the ever-running pumpkin and its dark
capture-land vine, different from the blue-green of the not so far-away hills.

In the hot sun and the swirling Caribbean heat I noticed that even the trees grew in disorder.
Everything grew everywhere and any old how. A coconut tree grew tall beside a pear, next to a
breadfruit, near a mango, behind a guinep, under the ackee pushing a pimento tree. I kept on
going and after a while I stumbled on a heap of stones and noticed there were eleven such heaps
near a shady grove. The grove was semi-dark and wet and I dropped my wanderer's sack,
stretched myself and inhaled the overpowering smell of coffee rose and over-ripe jackfruit fallen

from the tree. At the bottom end of the grove, where the light was, white water oozed, at
