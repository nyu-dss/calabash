SHHH

Now listen:

time is shaken

whenever your name is spoken,
and the loneliness of spent hours
shift the boundaries of my earth.
The tremors of places touched
are now the war zones of your love;
my body has betrayed me.

I am waiting for the sands to fall
but the reality of fevers

is my circumstance of silence.
When I reach out to you in eddies
the wind falters my step

and I pause

to blink away the sand

and like that you are gone.
