in memory of his past elegies.
I further declined assistance from him
because I wanted to care for my own.

Later at home, I danced to some zouk music and played
ring around the roses with my daughters.

we danced to a sweat and waltzed to the backyard,

our bare toes embracing the dewy earth,

where our delicate-stemmed daffodils awaited

patiently for our greetingsâ€”a language

we whispered by moistening the earth with our tears.
tears that smelled like raw roses.
