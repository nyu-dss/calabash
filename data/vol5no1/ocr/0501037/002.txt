pain of having to drop what we thought was the magic line we had finally found at 2:00 a.m.,
of being told to leave out the violins and let the poem speak. But the most punishing pain of all
came after the distribution of the poem when the waiting started...sometimes having to listen to
a long silence broken only by the crunching up of paper and the thud of its landing in the bin.

In the early days, each of struggled in our own way with the transition from the
“spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling” to the rigours of craft. We chided ourselves for this
self-inflicted agony, looking questioningly at one another when others spoke at poetry readings
of writing poems “on the way to the podium”; or citing McNeil’s unforgettable warning “Poetry
can kill a man”. We questioned our sanity for allowing ourselves to be hounded by pentameters
and trochees buzzing in our ears at all hours of night. While Delores reproduced the mist of her
rural country yard and her iconic water tank in unforgettable metaphors, Gwyneth assumed her
position first and foremost as the love poet — dusting out the remnants of long ago relationships

accurate punctuation sometimes drove us to distraction. The younger among us who had not
been brought up on grammar and Latin root words, struggled at times to understand some of the
editing. But their inability to be awed by anything, freed them from restraint and their we older
ones marveled at their growth.

Each of us threatened in our own way to give up, especially after writing a whole page of

“Master”’). We argued about apparent divisions and intolerance in the world of writing - Creole
vs. standard; performance poetry vs.the written word; , metrical order vs. free verse. A motley
crew of Jamaicans led by a Trinijamaican man of many parts, we sometimes agonized over this
country of ours in which some would deny others the right to speak authentically about the
Jamaican experience.

“e.

Admonished by Delores to remember Auden’s assertion that “poetry makes nothing
happen” we comforted ourselves with the fact that he also said poetry
survives, that it is

irrelevant issues and continued the journey believing there was space for all who would work to
