write better.

We shared the secrets of our innermost selves through the words
that we dared to put on paper. We shared the work to refine what
we did, to make some of it acceptable for the unforgiving public
glare; we shared the bin in which the ones that didnâ€™t make it,
were unceremoniously hurled. Sometimes we just rested from our
other lives and from our own efforts, laying our heads on the

words of the masters.

By the weaving of just one thread from the fabric of each or our
lives, we deepened our understanding of our humanity and the

humanity of others.
