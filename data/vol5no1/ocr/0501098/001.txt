MARIANELA MEDRANO

The Tao of Majarete

On the table I arrange the seven ears of corn my husband brought me from the market.
He put them in front of me as if placing precious jade stones to warm up the cold nostalgia that
winter settles in my eyes. I arrange them with joyful patience on the faux stone kitchen counter
top alongside which so many conversations have shown him the never-taken photographs of my
childhood. From those years we only have the yellowed, blurry images that Mami guards
vehemently. In those, we appear tightly grouped and scared, with the frozen smiles that we
would send my father. I used to imagine the smiles swiftly crossing the blue waters to reach the
snow country where I now await the other photographs—the vivid ones, the ones I draw with the
pencil of my memory. In this electronic era the photographs come on cyber wings, and it is not
the same. That is why I entertain myself reinventing the past for the attentive ears of my
nostalgia.

I came to this country long before the plane brought me. I came in my father’s dream.
My journey started in 1969, when the naiveté, the desire to escape the decompensating country,
called him across the blue waters to plant himself in Paterson, New Jersey. Ten years later
disenchantment returned him to El Cibao’s hot navel. When the plane brought me in 1987, my
eyes knew the landscape. My feet knew very well which paths to avoid and which avenues to
explore.

The ears of corn look so fresh. Their scent sends me back to the rainy days that dressed in
green the dry fields of the Northeast area where I was born. I open them to find the line of
pearls, perfect like Mami’s teeth; juicy as her breasts that soothed my infant’s vehemence. As if

a newcomer to the world, I suck the miraculous milk of memory, drinking the past in an instant.
