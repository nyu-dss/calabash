uprooted him before he grew roots. I think of his love for guayaba and tamarindo, the sweet-sour
uvas de playa and the limoncillos, “the world’s richest fruits,” as he says. I ask myself, then,
where does identity rests? Or is it that we are from everywhere and identities, like borders, are
only political inventions? I think of the loving, industrious man, who in another language calms
my nostalgia, cuddles me to sleep with a soft song that gives me back the island’s warmth. This
man who buys hope and leaves it spread on the kitchen counter where so many times, between
ginger tea and corn bread, he has seen images of my floating, airborne country and my essence,
which does not live here or there because it has no geography.

The strong waves of emotion put me on guard; I prepare for the ritual. I breathe deeply
and visualize the blue sea. I exhale the air while inviting nostalgia to enter and exit my chest, in a
cleansing act. I breathe again, deeply, slowly, the blue sea. I exhale nostalgia and vigilant nights,
and inhale peace. One by one I order my chakras to open so energy can descend until its beam of
soft light dissolves the curds that gather amid the circles my hand draws.

I think of the ancient patience of the women who came before my entrance into this
world. I imagine them balancing the tumbling energy of their tired spirits. What magic, what
spell fell upon the pots so the soft, sweet, curd-free Majarete could pose, proud and
presumptuous debutante, on the plates?

The women who came before me looked at the sea in front of them without imagining the
other side. Their eyes drank all the blue and the salitre, a mix that confined them to the island.
Preserved in time they became voices of clay, murmurs that descend into my ears, opened like
receptacles. That is why I was born with this prisoner’s instinct, with this affection for flying. I
entertain myself by looking at the circles drawn by my hand. I settle on the idea that if this
Majarete does not work out, I always have the option to try again, to reinvent this moment, and
this, and this, and this one...to open my chakras, my spirit, while playing with textures and tones.
Maybe I will start to make clay pots, like the women who came before me, so to enjoy the
spoiled Majarete, until the genius conquers magic and the curds dissolve or never form because

my aligned chakras will do the trick.
