I carefully align the ears of corn, rubbing them one after the other on an aluminum shredder
placed over a pot. The milky, cold juice hits the bottom and through it I hear Mami’s sententious
voice reminding me that any strong emotion, anger or sadness, will curdle the Majarete. I laugh
at that nonsense and promise myself that nothing in this world will spoil my culinary project.

I see myself on the island, tired of breast-feeding hope; tiptoeing always so as not to
awaken the gossip that deepened my rage and my desire to depart. On the island women walked
with care, like this, the same way my hand embraces the tender corn and slides it along the
surface of the shredder. I dance a melodious dance with the soft roundness of the corn. I close
my eyes and let myself go into the moment, until a sharp stab alerts my senses. The corn milk is
joined by the fast flow of the blood coming from my knuckles.

Again I hear Mami’s voice ensuring me that if one has la luna while preparing Majarete,
it will curd. I ask myself whether the soft milk mixture could differentiate this blood dripping
from my knuckles from that, which, overwhelmed by emotion, inundates the feminine pad I hold
between my legs. Something more than my fingers and my ovaries bleeds. Somehow I realize
it is time to walk up the scaffold that can take me to conformity. Could it be that with the years
and the distance from our country we become more fragile? Or could it be that what I am calling
fragility is nothing more than strength? The strength that comes from grabbing life as if comes,
learning to walk in the darkest part of the day? That darkness that only manifests in our ocular
circle and does not exist for others. I am talking about the gray days, in which the radiant sun
brightens everything but our doubt, that hard stone settled in the stomach, giving us, immigrants,
the absent-minded air we have.

I finish shredding the corn and stop proudly to see the thick white juice in the pot. With
enthusiasm I open the Goya coconut milk. On the wrapper a coconut tree against sunshine
promises the island flavor in a sip. The two milks mix and my hand plays with the dusty essence
of powdered cinnamon that diffuses new tones. Thick brown sugar falls upon the mixture and the
scent ascends to my most profound essence. Growing more enthusiastic I plant myself in front
of the stove and start to draw circles with the wooden spoon my hand embraces. Each circle is a
movie, a passage of what was left. In file the mutilated bodies of my illusions drop dead. I want
to go out and take in fresh air, distance myself so to breathe with ease, seek my essence away
from my essence. I look at my hands, no longer so dark from the raw winters, and I wonder if I
have not lost something more than skin tone.

I think of my son, the one who never drank milk from my breast, the one I had to teach,

with slow enunciation, the word Majarete; and deep inside it bothers me to think that perhaps I
