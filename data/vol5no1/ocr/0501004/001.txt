CITY OF POETRY

(for Medellin)

it is you again

in another place, unrobed

bare muse,

in the valley of fat nudes

stark iron soft maidens roundly

fashioned by the hands of the self in exile

see them all waiting the kiss of the men at war
for that day when the armies meet. sin pistoles

bare muse,

looking over the city, the firing volleys in earshot

burst of volition the light to see si

el dorado was not gold.it was land.

but here we are.where every man should once in his life
(not in any other life)

have this.a woman who adores him

(stirs in him the consummate black hole to ebullience)
even if blind he sees, she walks barest from the shower,
wet full wonder, her lips, fan of thirst, snare beads of water
she wanders to the dryness of his unsuspecting body,
pressing herself hungrily

until he and she and sheet reach in the deep soak,

a wanton geography of sea

bare muse,
here she is countless
she wears... from the shower

from the rain
from the zinc-curtained bath
from the basinâ€™s marble terrain
