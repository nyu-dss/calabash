the years because there wasn’t much rain. Their next door neighbor had a well, which contained
enough water to sustain them for a few years. So their plantation was greener than the greenest
grass you ever did see (my aunt’s own words). One day, TiJean, the son of the poor family,
woke up by the loud gurgling in his stomach. He yawned, his head spinning. He was twelve
years old, but he could pass for a non-developed nine year old. His hair was beginning to turn
red, a sign of malnutrition the volunteer nurse at the local clinic warned, just a few months
earlier.

So TiJean got up and ventured into a secluded corner of his backyard to wash up. He
was barefoot. There was no longer any dewy grass to tickle his toes. He looked up
and saw bannann trees, their broad leaves, flapping in the breeze. He saw coconut and mango
and orange trees towering, teasing him with their fragrance, which the wind blew through his
tiny nostrils as though to tempt him. He swallowed saliva and focused his attention on his
mother who, crouching near the fire, was making some coffee. He assumed this because he
could make out the shape of the grék, which she used to strain the coffee. He closed his eyes to
see if he could seep in its aroma, but he couldn’t. He knew it was because she only used a
teaspoon as opposed to the five heaps of tablespoon she used to use when their own plantation
was greener than the greenest grass you ever did see.

Ti Jean spotted two servant girls picking eggs in various corners of the yard. He stared,
smelling the sweet aroma of fried eggs. Suddenly, he dashed to the front of his house and
climbed the wooden gate that separated his house from his wealthy neighbor’s. He landed
safely and smiled his proud smile. He picked up a large rock and aimed for a ripe mango
Jransik, hoping Monsieur Rubin would see him and give him a whole sack to take home. He
smiled at the idea too. Sadly, the poor thing missed. He watched as the rock landed on the
head of a chicken, its head spurting blood, as it squealed.

Later that day, an eyewitness said he watched with horror as Monsieur Rubin’s machete
was raised in the air and cut off TiJean’s head. He said he stood behind the trunk of a tree,
watching as the boy’s head thumped on the ground, which wasted no time drinking his innocent
blood. The witness said that he was too far to hear something Monsieur Rubin said to the boy
before killing him. But supposedly, he was able to read
his lips and make out what Monsieur Rubin told the boy as he landed the machete against his
neck. “A koz de vakabon, san sal tankou ou mwen pa menm ka domi lanuit. M ap fout trase
yon ekzanp sou ou. Because of vagabonds and lowlifes like you, I can’t even sleep at

night. Damn it, ’'m using you as an example. That ought to teach you all a lesson.”
