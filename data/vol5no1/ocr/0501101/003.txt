And to make a long story short, the town mourned the death of the boy and tried to
console his parents as best as they could. Some neighbors brought them strong, dark and bitter
tasting coffee, saying it would prevent them from going into shock. Others brought bazilik tea,
sweetened with sugarcane syrup, swearing by its power to heal the worst of broken
hearts. Some of the men brought plantains and yam, apologizing for the meager portions. They
thought Monsieur Rubin had committed a grave crime, but because he had wealth and on
occasions sold them some water, they kept their comments hush hushed—that he was a monster
and the devil in disguise and a former Tonton Macoute soldier all trapped in one.

Naturally, Ti Jean’s parents couldn’t get over his death. They spent their days in rags
and burned candles and prayed for vengeance. At last, it came to TiJean’s father in a dream
what he had to do. He had to kill not one of Monsieur Rubin’s boys. But all three. They were
triplets. They could only be told apart by their skin’s hues. They had the same pointy head and
eyes that were always squinting in the sun and cheeks that were plump. Medium brown was
one. Light-medium brown was one. And dark medium brown was one.

So TiJean’s father spent the next few weeks watching, waiting for the opportunity to
come when the children would be left alone in the care of the servant girls. At last, the
opportunity came when both Monsieur and Madame Rubin’s Jeep disappeared down the dirt
road one morning. TiJean’s father’s teeth gleamed for the first in a long time, matching the
luster on his machete. The gate was left open.

Like a man possessed by a demon, he followed the triplet’s drone in their backyard and
with one swift movement of the blade, one head was down. Surprisingly, the other boys didn’t
even scream. They whimpered, backed away, and ended in the thickets where he proceeded to
chop both of their heads. The servant girls who were doing some chores inside heard only
silence. They panicked and ran barefoot in the backyard where they followed a trail of blood,
their screaming echoing.

It turned out that TiJean’s parents left town before Madame and Monsieur could
return. And when they did return, they were soon seen with their heads shaved, mourning the

death of their boys, sometimes pounding the earth until it tasted blood.
