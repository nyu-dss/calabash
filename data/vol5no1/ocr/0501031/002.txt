IV

The yellow dog turns his eye on me.

I taste vinegar, think, ‘It is finished!’

Vv

The shame in me bent into a bow,
like the lapped tail
of the yellow dog.

VI
An old moon lifts through the air’s raw scent-
the yellow dog drags its belly

on the pavement.

Vil

I hang my head in shame

having seen the faces that spat

as the yellow dog drifted through
my thoughts ...

Vill

All I have seen is nothing
compared to the yellow dog
whose tongue hangs out at the

sight of
Everything!
