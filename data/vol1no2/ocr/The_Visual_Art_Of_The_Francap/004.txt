interchangeable. This is a singular site where — he says — he is able to survey the sacred earth, like his
Amerindian ancestors. Goudin-Thébia places his relation to the cosmos in the forefront of his work
and defines himself as a surveyor of landscapes, a collector of signs, a receiver of energies, seeking
to detect and decipher, within the traces, the rocks, and tree barks, the information conveyed by the
cosmos.

This ascent towards origins through African ritual or Amerindian shaping of the land does not
exhaust the discourse of memory and recollection, which is inseparable from its obverse: anxiety
about the future. Where do we come from? Who are we? What are we becoming?

MEMORY HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL THEME OF THE MARTINIQUAN
Alex Burke's work: traces, imprints, vestiges. From black boxes to blue and gold altarpieces, it wishes
to bear witness to the passage of now-vanished, decimated humans, whose genocide is
commemorated by no stela, no monument. A project for an Amerindian cemetery has yet to take
shape. A pilgrimage to Gorée was carried out (In Memory of Gorée, 1998). Paradoxically, however,
these black boxes inhabited by tiny white-chiffon dolls inspired at once by Vodou and by the giant
marionettes of the Bread and Puppet Theater also evoke the bedroom communities of modern
times, the isolation and imprisonment, the normalizing force of the city, of modern life.

In his latest installations, Burke operates like an archaeologist of the present. Among the strata of
daily objects, pious images, advertising labels, household utensils, televisions, old clothes accumulated
and still impregnated with the lives of their owners, he tries to rediscover and recompose the scraps
of the true identity of today’s Caribbean individual: who can he be, this man torn apart by history,
depicted by these fragmented phantom silhouettes, aligned against the wall where the principal dates
of Caribbean history seem to be their ID numbers? In this way, through little touches, Burke
reconstitutes the hidden side of the décor of these “islands in the sun,” which appear so paradisiacal
on the glossy paper of tourist brochures.

Other artists privilege certain issues that are more specific to modernity, such as quotation and new
technologies. If Thierry Alet (Guadeloupe) returns to the past, it is the past of European and
American art history. Alet moves from painting (“The Dethroned King,” “The Laughing Heads”) to
installation (“Invisible Works”) to performance (“Three Centuries in Three Days”), and always with a
zest for provocation. During his 1994 performance, “Three Centuries in Three Days,” Alet publicly
painted, in Fort-de-France’s Cathedral Square, superimposed reinterpretations of nine masterpieces
from the history of art of the last three centuries: Canaletto’s “Architectural Caprice,” Fragonard’s
“Les hasards de l’escarpolette,” David’s “Oath of the Horatii,” Millet’s “Angelus,” Ingres’s “Large
Odalisque,” Monet's “Impression: Rising Sun,” Picasso’s “Les demoiselles d’Avignon,” Warhol's
“Marilyn Monroe,” and Basquiat’s “Dime a Dozen.” Today, a gray monochrome conceals these nine
superimposed paintings.
