monumental organization of the image itself in reduced formats, and a sense of synthesis. He does
not adopt a particular mask, but his borrowings have diverse geographical origins. References to
African arts in Lam’s work goes well beyond the period between 1938 and 1940, which has
traditionally been located as the time of his falling under Picasso’s influence, and extend themselves
to the entirety of his work. Upon Lam’s return to Cuba, Aftican influence on his art is no longer
merely formal; what Lam is seeking to recover in Cuban customs is Aftican soul, African poetry.
Without making a realist or ethnographic description, Lam transposes the world of Santeria into his
highly personal pictorial universe.

In Martinique, René Louise avails himself of the same magico-teligious practice, at least in certain
installations. However, the voice of Africa is not solely expressed in modern Caribbean art through
sacred discourse, as is frequently the case in Cuba. African resurgence takes numerous other forms.
For example, in 1970, three Martiniquan artists created the Black-Caribbean school in Abidjan,
Ivory Coast. According to their manifesto, “The Black-Caribbean school’s objective is to make an
essentially black painting known... It is currently made up of three Antilleans who have come from
Martinique, passed through Europe, and finally discovered Africa, which reveals to them, free from
all constraint, the profound intimacy of Black nature.” If Serge Hélénon is to be believed, his
discovery of Aftica modified his artistic trajectory: “The Dogon country brought me truth in the raw
sensation of things — without artifice. In 1965, my painting was decorative, and the Dogon country
led me to authenticity, and Dogon statuary, in its hieratic austerity and severity led me to prune my
work of all superfluity.”!

Bertin Nivor (Martinique) claims his links to the Boni of Guyana and draws direct inspiration
from the art of the tembé to achieve his large, flexible panels decorated with abstract decorative motifs,
The tembé is a set of geometrical drawings of a symbolic character that decorates the doors of
houses, the blades of oars, the teeth of combs, and spoons in the Black settlements founded by
maroon slaves in Guyana.

The forms of the pieces in untreated wood by Franz Absalon (Martinique) could well evoke Asmat
shields. The relationship to the material is the same. But Absalon privileges abstract decorative motifs,
not anthropomorphic drawings like the Asmat. The repetition of simple geometric forms, not
unrelated to certain drum decorations or Fang spoons, the sobriety of the forms, the chromatic
restriction to three basic tones (white, black, natural wood) situate Absalon’s sculptures under the
combined influence of primal art and minimalist art.

The miniature characters of Philippe Beaunol (Martinique), like Selatamboulefan, Matadolo, and
Selalescribe have names that are neither French, Creole, nor African, but play upon evocative sonorities,
Vegetable fibers, feathers, and shells enter into their composition, just as a shred of salvaged fur
clothes Papakayali. They bring African fetishes to mind.

Henri Tauliant (Martinique) also summons up Africa, but more casually. His Fetish Ashtray is a
