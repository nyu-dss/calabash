parody of an African mask. Conceived with a great economy of means, starting from recovered
materials, these creations confusedly recall Africa but in a completely different spirit from previous
generations.

On the other hand, Ernest Breleur (Martinique), who in his early years with the “Groupe
FWOMAJE” quoted African art in his paintings, distanced himself from that practice. As Milan
Kundera has written, “The initial period of his painting was still programmatically anchored in
African culture: Wifredo Lam’s influence was recognizable, and the motifs taken from African popular
art were discernible. Ernest no longer cares for these pictures; he sees in them something forced,
artificial; as he explains this to me, he gets carried away by his thoughts and even accuses himself of
cheating for having wished to pass off a rationally preconceived collective program as artistic
spontaneity. It is impossible to restore a black art by means of memories of a lost Africa. For, he tells
me, these memories no longer exist. Africa is no longer our world. The subsequent periods of his
painting are very personal, free from all program, all engagement. But this is the paradox: in this
painting, which cannot be more personal than it is, Martiniquan identity, black identity, and Antillean
negritude are present in all their striking evidence.”

THE OTHER QUASI-OBLIGATORY ASPECT OF THE RETURN TO ORIGINS IS THE
Amerindian vein. Perhaps it is less evident, given that the genocide of the Amerindians was
perpetrated too early for traces of their culture to be considerable. This tradition is the most buried,
the least discernible. It is nonetheless the case that the Amerindian vein has been faithfully exploited
by such artists as the Barbadian Jocelyn Gardner, the Guyanese Rosemarie Robinot and Thierry Tian
Sio Po, the Aruban Ciro Abath, and the Martiniquan Victor Anicet. Abath and Anicet are ceramicists,
as were their distant and hypothetical ancestors. Within his installations, Victor Anicet integrates
painted canvases inspired by Amerindian signs and “trays” diverted from their current use. The word
“tray,” of English origin, has passed into the Creole language and designates a rudimentary board of
white wood, used both for the transport of stones and of clothes to be washed in the river, and
generally carried by women who balance it on their head; as well, it is used to carry ironed clothes
or light foodstuffs to be sold in the street, and as a surface on which to play the dice-game known
as serbie. From these trays, Anicet makes frames decorated with copies of Pre-Columbian anthropo-
zoomorphic forms, sometimes colored and pasted on African fabrics.

Serge Goudin-Thébia also cultivates the Amerindian style, but takes a completely different
approach, linked more to nature and spirituality. This artist-shaman practices a poetics of earth, in
relation to a privileged place, the near-island of Caravelle, which he has explored hundreds of times
for harvests of natural objects, drifting bamboos, madrepores, strange minerals, and cocoloba leaves,

which are then inserted into his perpetually mutating installations, where they remain
