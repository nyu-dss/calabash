The dorliss is a relatively recent character in Caribbean tradition, and it seems, specifically
Martiniquan. To borrow Ina Césaire’s terminology, he belongs to the family of “wandering spectral
characters” who appear at random in society, like the “black hand” or the “headless man.” This
character does not appear in Creole folklore. He does, however, emerge in popular beliefs following
the 1960s, and in his novel L’Homme au baton (The Man with the Stick), Ernest Pépin introduces a
similar character. He is one of the rare characters with sexual overtones, a local version of the incubus
with the power of introducing himself into the best-protected homes to sexually abuse women
while they are asleep. A whole series of rituals are practiced to protect oneself ftom him and keep
him at a distance: for example, wearing red underpants or two black underpants inside out.

This same grounding in Caribbean reality may be found in the work of Bruno Pédurand
(Guadeloupe). In the first place, there are borrowings from the terminology and the visual
iconography of Vodou and Santeria. The title of his series, Ogun, locates it under the sign of the
god of fire and war, just as the choice of “Iwa” as a pseudonym confirms Pédurand’s interest in Afto-
Caribbean religions. In addition, the metallic bases, which are different for each of the works in this
series, are rich in Vodou's véve forms. However, there is no single source of inspiration, since Iwa’s
creative process is an experiment in visually transposing the literary concept of Creoleness, by means
of the juxtaposition, superimposition, and contrasting of images. Scanned images are chosen as
elements of a theme and blended in view of an encounter that could perhaps be either a fusion or
a misfortune. The figures of the dog and the boat have been part of Pédurand’s visual alphabet for
many years, and crosses, banknotes, and hearts also coexist in these images whose discrete grid
framework emphasizes the reconstitution of the image.

Like Mirabel, Marie-Jane Viator (Guadeloupe) does self-portraits, but she accords greater
importance to photography that has been transferred onto canvas and touched up with tiny reddish-
brown brushstrokes. The fragmentation of the face appears in three portraits: Woven Face, Untitled 1,
and Untitled 2. There is a clear inclination towards lightly woven veiling; there as well, the face
appears only in fragments and always half-concealed. Taut Bust is clearly a homage to Man Ray: the
posture — outstretched neck, exposed throat, face thrown backwards — presents many similarities
to a 1930 photo, Anatomy. Moreover, a series of small photographs are juxtaposed with the primary
image, which clearly call the Rayographs to mind, and particularly Man Ray’s famous Woman, which
depicts a kitchen whisk and its projected shadow. Viator frames the primary image with small
negatives, simulations of the human face, somewhat in the style of Arcimboldo, composed with the
help of such accessories as keys, belt-buckles, spectacles, or kitchen utensils like the whisk and the
paddle. In the framework of these images, the ID number 03834 appears, in the artist's words, like
a bar-code on a consumer product.

Piecing things together is at the essence of the work of Valérie John (Martinique). She fashions
