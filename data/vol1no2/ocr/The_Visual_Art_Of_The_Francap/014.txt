her medium out of the juxtaposition, superimposition, and amalgamation of several layers of paper
that have either been salvaged or made by hand, and sheets of photocopier paper that preserve
residual traces of everything that has been previously photocopied onto them. At the end of the
process, the whole thing becomes rigid, resistant, hard, and thick; the surface appears dented,
blistered, uneven. The color emerges from the material, even if it is touched up and at times
brightened by pigments. It is the extraction of the carbon — chance and mastery — that creates
these bursts of opaline whiteness, like trembling wings, in the density of blacks. The grid of this
background, obtained through assemblage and fusion, guides the geometrical structuring of the
surface, clearly inspired by the African kimono or pagne. The arrangement of the surface in different
symmetrical spaces (usually seven in number), the declination of an identical motif with opening,
development, and closing, the imperceptible irregularity within the repetition — all belong to the
tradition of the pagne, whereas the all-over work, the primacy given to the background, the use of
repeated geometrical forms, are part of a process that resembles the Supports/Surfaces movement.
Africa remains present in the imaginary writing carved into the thickness of the picture before the
final stages of drying and varnishing: a free calligraphy executed rapidly in order to avoid any
message, but which strongly recalls Arabic writing, of which several signs may be recognized here
and there. The whole of the work is serene, with several flashes of preciosity when occasional
strokes of gold inscribe their vivacity on the luxuriance and complex sumptuousness of the blacks.

The work of Barbara Prezeau (Haiti) deals with mestizaje and what she herself defines as a
shantytown aesthetic. Halfway between painting and sculpture, her works resemble a “patchwork
obtained by the diversion of materials and objects that come to mind either from my own culture
or from the outside.” In these assemblages, sheet metal is cut into forms that have been freely inspired
by Haitian Vodou symbols, and as in Pédurand’s work, serve as a support for the whole, which is
composed of heterogeneous materials, pieces of brightly-colored cloth, and colored pearls. Prezeau
takes objects from her immediate surroundings, wherever she happens to be living — Haiti, Paris,
Canada, or Africa (cf. the Ashanti comb in Couple). Mestizaje is also effected between traditional visual
vocabulary and the language of modern art.

This brief introduction does not pretend to cover the whole of the region’s vital visual arts;
however, it may well suffice as a demonstration of the undeniable presence of the creative impulse.
The trump cards of Caribbean visual creation are the dynamics of its extreme youth — the tradition
of the visual arts is only a hundred years old — and its originality, due in no small part to its capacity
for integrating multiple influences: European, African, Amerindian, Asian, and Indian.

Incontestably, that special sound cailed for by the founders of Tropiques in 1941 is beginning to be
heard. And its echoes will soon be heard even more widely. Everything shows that it will be capable
of clearing a path for itself, between cultural anchoring and innovation.
