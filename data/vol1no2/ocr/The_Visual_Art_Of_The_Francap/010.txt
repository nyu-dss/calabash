been inspired by these lines, as are the retables of Alex Burke, who, struck by the questions posed
by squats — living spaces that have been abandoned and yet are filled with memories and traces —
created basic constructions of strata of fresh-cut wood enhanced by pasted-on pieces of old paper,
rags, dirt, and scraps. This tendency — or necessity — to create starting from everything and
nothing, described by Aimé Césaire, leads to an aesthetics of hybridity:

with bits of string
with wood shavings
with anything all the cheap cuts
with low blows
with shovelfuls of dead leaves
with remnants of cloth
with lacerate lassos
with links snapped from the chain gang
with the bones of moray eels
with torn away whips
with sea conches
with flags and tombs mismatched
by whirlwinds
and waterspouts

Unlike in Picasso’s case, the assemblage does not, then, appear to correspond to the need to
resolve formal questions. It bears closer resemblance to the African practice that inspired Picasso in
his will to renew the Western tradition: namely, the mixture of heterogeneous materials, incompatible
with the hierarchy and unity of materials demanded by the “fine arts” of that period but occurring
frequently in African tradition, particularly during the creation of fetishes and emblems in which
raffia, string, bark, metal, wood, and found objects are integrated. The African fetish is related to a
collective ideology, and the meaning of the various elements is, in general, clear to the initiates,
whereas in contemporary art the choice of materials is more of a formal than a symbolic matter.

At times, collage and assemblage metamorphose into sutures, as in the work of Ernest Bréleur. In
1991, convinced that he had reached the end of his pictorial investigations, Bréleur made a complete
break with painting and embarked upon the exploration of a material used with relative infrequency,
radiographic film, and working with light. Like Man Ray in 1922, he could well say: “I freed myself
from the sticky medium of painting and I’m working directly with light itself.” The choice of this
medium corresponds to the artist’s desire to plumb the secret regions of the body, to discover its

internal structures, and to the attempt to unveil a secret, which could already be foreshadowed in a
previous series of paintings on old wooden gates, entitled, precisely: “Radiographs of Doors.”
