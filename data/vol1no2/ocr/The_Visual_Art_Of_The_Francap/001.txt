HE QUEST FOR IDENTITY, EMBARKED UPON IN 1939 IN CESAIRE’S NOTEBOOK
A sé a Return to the Native Land, remains at the center of Caribbean creation. However, an
increasing number of artists, without renouncing the expression of what is most individual in them,
are seeking to enunciate this quest in the language that is most attuned to art’s present condition.
They explore Caribbean identity, through African or Amerindian roots, reawaken memory, and tackle
the question of racial and cultural mestizaje. They also interrogate the modern social reality of the
Caribbean, between insularity and emigration, as well as its past and present economic context.
Thus, the echo of an identical questioning reverberates throughout the archipelago — that of
identity, between a return to the origins and foreign influences. How to define oneself amidst all
these cultural strata? How to divide up one’s ancestry between a vanished Amerindian culture and a
pregnant African culture? How to locate oneself in relation to the dominant aesthetics of the

Center? This brief introductory essay hopes to shed some light on these questions.

THE TRACES OF AFRICAN CULTURES HAVE BEEN VARYINGLY REINVESTED IN THE
mestizo art of the Caribbean. The emblematic figure of Wiftedo Lam remains the most renowned
exemplar of this. His work displays a powerful syncretism but accords a great deal of room to
African artistic models. Along with being initiated into African cults by his godmother, Mantonica
Wilson, he was also aware of Picasso's formal research, inspired by black art, and furthermore,
became even more intensely interested in /a cosa negra after his meeting with Aimé Césaire in Fort-
de-France and experiencing the revelation of reading the Notebook of a Return to the Native Land. Lam’s
painting does not carry out a simple transposition of an African form in its totality for imitative ends.
Rather, he gleans certain visual solutions from the African formal universe: extreme schematization,
frontal perspective, the absence of relief and moulding, priority of the lines of force that structure
the figure, modification of bodily proportions, exaggerations of certain volumes such as the head,
