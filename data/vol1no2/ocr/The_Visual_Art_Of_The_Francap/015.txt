To understand the irony of the title “Volga Beach,” one should know that the Volga neighborhood, on the
outskirts of Fort-de-France, was a squatters’ settlement, built towards the end of the 1950s on flood-prone
mangroves. It was once a labyrinthine heap of rickety shacks, built with diverse cast-off materials from the
city. This reality is, then, far-removed from the exotic dream of sun and hot sand.
