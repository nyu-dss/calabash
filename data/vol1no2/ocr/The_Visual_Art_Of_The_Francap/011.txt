Here, there is equally a will to reveal that which is hidden behind the trappings of the body as
there is a resolution to advance a line of inquiry. After having explored the theme of death, notably
in a series of white paintings where decomposing corpses seem to blur into the background of the
picture, and where the liquefaction of the body is signified pictorially by multicolored hues, the
obverse question — of life, of survival — has imposed itself: to see, in some way, from the other
side of death. It is then that his work with transparency developed, where light is not directly
utilized in the work but is integrated into its conception. As in a stained-glass window, contact and
intensity of light transfigure the subject matter, creating forms and spaces in a modulation, a
vibration where opacity and whiteness, darkness and transparency, are opposed. The differential
value of shadow and light, notwithstanding, invites a metaphorical interpretation: darkness/light,
night/day, death/life. And in this duel between life and death, it is life that wins out, because, in a
simulation of a surgical action, Ernest Bréleur sutures these imaginary bodies. He operates under an
old surgical lamp, with gloves and a mask — to protect himself from glue fumes — and several
indispensable tools: pliers and cutters. The studio is a genuine operating room, with huge labeled
compartments meticulously arranged along the wall and where the elements necessary for the
realization of the work are accumulated: self-adhesives for the “sutures,” X-rays of skulls, limbs, and
stomachs, not to mention the final compartment with the rather fascinating label, “Remains.”

It is the myth of Isis revisited. Like the Egyptian goddess, who left in search of the remains of
her husband Osiris, assassinated and cut into pieces by his younger brother Set, so that she could
reassemble them and bring them back to life, Ernest Bréleur, as a surgeon or magician would, re-
stitches, repairs, and reanimates. Two extracts from Césaire’s poem, “Lay of Errantry,” which recalls
the myth of Isis, unavoidably well up in memory:

Everything that was ever torn
has been torn in me
everything that was ever mutilated
has been mutilated in me
Long ago oh torn one
in bits and pieces. She
gathered her dismembered one
and the fourteen pieces
took their triumphant place in the rays of evening. 7

However, what is involved here is the reconstitution of a multiple body composed of anonymous
bits of different individuals that have been sewn and stuck together in the magical act of
reanimation. There is an a priori incompatibility between the highly elaborate, quasi-ritualistic role-
