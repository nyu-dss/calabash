playing, and the chance that guides the artist's hand in assembling and pasting on the labels-sutures.
The coherence of the result might itself seem paradoxical in the eyes of the technique of work, a
truly automatic writing.

From this random practice, a dancing, joyous life is born — “...the shivering spawn of forms
liberating themselves/from facile bindings/and escaping from too premature combinings”® — but
nonetheless perfectly organized, an artistic illustration of the scientific relationship of chance and necessity.

Drawn from the reign of pure chance, harmonious structures emerge, constellations of stars on a
shadowy sky, a field of signs from an improbable arithmetic, genetic and chromosomal charts, a
theory of pixels...

The desire to renovate art by renovating the materials, transparency, the repetition of the same
visual sign, the invitation to abandon a fixed position in relation to the artwork, the investigation of
flickering movement, and the permanent scintillation of the surface — all these bring Bréleur close
to kinetic art. Video projections and slides reinforce the luminous vibration of these installations.

Around this theme of fracture and suture, there is an ample range of contributions, from
Raymond Medelice’s relatively classical albeit complex pictorial technique to Bruno Pédurand’s use
of computer graphics, which enables him to appropriate scanned, juxtaposed, and superimposed
photographic fragments. Marie-Jane Viator exploits the photographic medium, while Valérie John
and Barbara Prezeau use collage and assemblage. The division of the image is immediately
perceptible in the visual productions of Médelice and Viator. Conversely, the distinct fragments are
associated, joined together, and juxtaposed in the work of John, Pédurand, and Prezeau.

Raymond Médelice (Martinique) superimposes two or three coats of the same color of paint to
prepare the ground of the canvas, and then spreads a fresh layer of the desired color before the
preceding coats have dried, which favors the migration of the colors. In this way, he obtains a specific
coloristic effect by creating a full range of nuances through the more or less spontaneous blending
of colors directly on the canvas. Next, he uses a trowel to etch swirls and scrolls into the colored
layer, thereby endowing the surface of the painting with a virtual movement. The principle of
declination of the same images occurs on a dual level, in the series and in the painting. In the series,
it corresponds to a desire to go deeper, aesthetically and thematically. In the painting, the partitioning
of the image, its grid structure, participates in the narrative and brings to light the influence of comic
strips, as does the presence of written texts in the composition. Thus, one of the canvases of the
“Dorliss Cycle” presents the viewer with sixteen squares, each of which encloses the same sign
repeated four times on the horizontal plane, but modified very slightly each time. First, the moon,
because night is the kingdom of the dorliss and the night-star its means of transport; then, woman,
the victim of the dorliss, who takes possession of her spirit in order to more easily possess her body
later on; next, the dorliss himself, always shown from behind, a mysterious character, at once feared
and desired; and finally, the dog, a veritable Cerberus with his studded collar, pointed teeth, and his
