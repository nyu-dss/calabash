Another facet of Caribbean artistic creation, without actually using new technologies, is inspired
by or resembles them. Thus, Hugues Bellechasse (Martinique) weds photography, video, and
installation art. He borrows the rigor of scientific language (aeronautical terminology, application of
the physical laws of evolution in the air, use of research methods such as summaries, comparisons,
and inventories) and applies it to the eroticized female body in order to simulate, not without humor,
“test crashes” intended to measure the resistance of two female bodies propelled into space with
equal velocity. He also plays with the physical notion of the black body, which absorbs all the
radiation it receives, and with the situation of the black man reduced to slavery who integrates into

his own the unknown culture he discovers.

A THEME OF FRAGMENTATION AND SUTURE MAY BE PERCEIVED IN AN IMPORTANT
number of artworks from this region. Is this attributable to an — unconscious? — transposition of
the “diffracted but recomposed”3 reality of the Creole world? Some will not fail to see in
fragmentation a metaphor for the geographic scattering of the archipelago, the dispersion of the
diaspora, identity dislocation — indeed, at times, even the fracturing caused by continental drift.

The ghostly photocopied and cut-up silhouettes whose ID numbers are the major dates in the
history of the archipelago, presented by Alex Burke during the Island in the Sun exhibition — do
these not evoke this fracturing of Caribbean man? Monique Mirabel (Martinique)’s installation
Fragments (1997) consists of a fragmentary presentation of her own face: nearly thirty drawings,
photos, photocopies, and paintings blending fragments of mirrors and representing isolated elements
of her face make up an exploded self-portrait that, according to the artist’s statement, does not
emphasize a disintegrated personality, but rather the individual’s propensity to reveal only facets of
the self.

By means of techniques of collage, assemblage, and pasting, other works appear to correspond
to the style of creole construction as defined by the fathers of Creoleness. An example is the series
Expressions-Shantytowns by Serge Hélénon, who since the 1970s has abandoned the traditional canvas
surface to paint on an uneven surface of salvaged pieces of wood, bearing the wealth of their
previous use and put together in the style of the ramshackle constructions that are to be found in
poor neighborhoods around the world. Volga Beach (1989)*by Gérard Apat (Martinique) is in the
same vein, juxtaposing broken Venetian blinds, an old, worn-out Coca-Cola sign, and salvaged
boards. The irony of the title is as trenchant as Alex Burke’s Island in the Sun, and stigmatizes a
Caribbean reality that is far from the exotic dream of a paradisiacal island. These works echo a few
lines from Notebook of a Return to the Native Land: “...and the thin roof patched with pieces of
gasoline cans, which create swamps of rust in the stinking sordid gray straw pulp.”> The assemblages

of rusted iron, copper, brass, zinc, and sheet metal by Myrtha Richards (St. Martin) also seem to have
