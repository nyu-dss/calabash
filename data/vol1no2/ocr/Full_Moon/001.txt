Be
Full Moon

You need only be near

And the tide rises in waves
through the middle of me in urgent rush
thrilling,

Penetrating

You into me.

So much of what I am

You are.

And there are times when

I'm wild in the fields

and passion’s naked pain

settles like dew

on flower petals

And the moon’s fullness is

Like a lotus on a deep lonely pond.
