Be
Helen

Written in memory of Barbados Rhodes Scholar Helen Carnegie, who died in a
Brooklyn apartment fire, November 2000. She was a student at Tisch, New York
University at the time studying the art of film-making

Painting to the

music of Piaf

you stood out

with works

exhibiting an inky undercurrent
— 19 at the time

Yes you Helen
Among the most impressive

of the mid 90s
‘young contemporaries’

Later came the
Cave Hill drama stint.
You shining in
Death and the Maiden

Film was your first love
you said, and that’s where
the final curtain found you

Remember too, the
chill-of-night

cliff-edge scene

(like Batman’s eerie Gotham)
— ‘Escape’ you called it.

Did you know even then
where the roads led?
