Finally, it was the time for confrontation. Miss. Payne called Mrs. Bascombe into the small study
leading from her bedroom, and asked her to sit down. Never during Mrs. Bascombe's years of
employment had she been asked to sit down in Miss Payne’s study. She was seriously alarmed, as
she perched her bulky form on the edge of the indicated chair. Miss Payne began to talk. She talked
and she talked. She knew Mrs. Bascombe’s position, number of children, and her desire to own a
home of her own. As she proceeded, her confident tone faltered, and a pleading note entered her
voice. She spoke of Theodore’s father, and his expectations of his son. She hinted at diminished
income, and the danger of Mrs. Bascombe having to take a cut in pay. Finally she came to the point.
She wanted Ondré and Theodore to exchange names on eleven plus day.

Mrs. Bascombe was stunned. Never once, in all her weeks of wondering, had it entered her mind
that such a devious plot was afoot. “Miss Payne’, she spluttered, “you mad”! Now it was Miss Payne’s
turn to be stunned. It was the first disrespectful utterance she had ever heard from Mrs. Bascombein
her eleven years of service. “Miss Payne”, she continued “if I was suh stupid as tuh do da dey, wuh
would happen tuh my son den? Whu bout his school?” “Oh, I would pay for a private school for
him. He would do well anywhere. It would mean so much to Theodore’s father if he got in for his
old school.” “Sorry, Miss Payne, but I in doin’ nutten so.” Mrs. Bascombe was quite adamant. She
stood up, squared her shoulders and marched swiftly out of the room. Miss Payne was not giving
up so easily. She did not broach the subject again, but instead she bided her time until Saturday, when
the boys would be playing together in her house. She knew that they would do anything for each
other.

Saturday came. Mrs. Bascombe was sent to purchase a few things that Miss Payne “forgot” to buy.
As soon as it was safe the boys were called in and the plan was explained. Ondré was extremely
concerned. He knew how his family was counting on him to do well, and did not want to disappoint
them. Theodore was simply miserable. He had no desire at all to go to a school where he would have
to work hard just to avoid coming last. He visualized having to have extra lessons for the rest of his
life. Then, maybe because the situation required desperate measures, Theodore had the first brilliant
idea of his life. “Ondré, do it for me. You can always get a transfer or something.” Ondré stared at
Theodore in amazement. What was he doing? Theodore always told me he wanted to go to a private
school where he could work at his own pace and hopefully catch up. Then he saw it. Theodore
winked twice. It was their secret sign. They used it again and again when they wanted to go off on
their own.

“We're going to talk this over, mum,” said Theodore, and away they fled, relieved. The boys did
not stop running until they reached the small plywood play house which was at the far end of the
back garden. It had been made for Theo some years ago. No one would disturb them there. They
dragged two benches from one corner and sat down. Ondré looked at Theodore, anxious and
enquiring. Theodore looked back then revealed his plan.
