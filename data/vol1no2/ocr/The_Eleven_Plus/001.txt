HE AFFAIR BEGAN ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER THE THIRTIETH, NINETEEN
T eighty three. Miss Payne, in a private room at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and Mrs.
Bascombe in the public maternity ward of the same, both gave birth to sons, at seven thirty on the
dot. Miss Payne's son was once heavier, and Mrs.Bascombe’s baby had more hair, but apart from that,
it was virtually impossible to tell one from the other. Even the nurses, who were used to seeing
newborns every day who resembled each other and were quite blase about this occurrence, shook
their head in disbelief, and muttered that it was a good thing the babies were on separate floors,
“cause strange things does happen sometimes.”

Miss Payne, young, attractive, and ambitious, gingerly stretched her arms so as not to put a strain
on her still aching body and sighed with satisfaction. She would never have to file another portfolio

enthusiastic. This being before the days of the “Baby Friendly Regime”, what with young Theodore
being rather fractious, and his mother lacking patience at the best of times, a bottle of infants’
formula was prepared and brought in, much to their mutual satisfaction. Theodore’s father was
absent. He was at home with his wife and their children. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bascombe held and
suckled little Ondré with practiced ease, quite oblivious of the many visitors and nursing staff on
the ward. Mr. Bascombe freed one hand from holding his hat to stroke Ondré’s toes which had
escaped from the tiny blue and white blanket wrapped round him.

Fate determined that the two mothers should meet. All being well, they were both released two
days after the birth of their sons. As Miss Payne waited for the arrival of her taxi, and Mrs. Bascombe
