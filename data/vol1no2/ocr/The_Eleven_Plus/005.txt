The boys’ schools fell within the same catchment area, so they would be sitting their eleven plus
at the same secondary school. Theodore’s strategy was this — they would pretend to go along with
his mother’s plan as long as, on eleven Plus day, they were dropped off together at the gates, and
then left immediately for “security reasons’. They would then join the students from their respective
schools. Only afterwards would they exchange places, so it would appear that they had done what
Theodore’s mother had asked when it was time for them to be picked up. Ondré nodded. He could
see how Miss Payne would be fooled, but what about when the results came back. Theodore had
thought of that too. “We could say that you had a bad, bad headache, but I suddenly remembered
every thing I did at lessons!” Only Mrs. Bascombe would be in on the plan from the beginning.

Eleven Plus day dawned warm and bright. Ondré was quietly confident. Theodore was calm and
ready to do his best, especially now that the pressure was off. Afterwards they joined the excited
groups of children being claimed by parents and guardians, some of whom had been keeping vigil
since early morning. In the excitement nobody noticed the switch, and Miss Payne was happily
planning another eleven years of being maintained in the manner to which she was accustomed.
Mrs. Bascombe just smiled.

The results were announced. Ondré Bascombe, 225 A, Theodore Payne, 165 C. Ondré would be
going to the school of his first choice. Theodore would be traveling miles away to a private
secondary school. His father, disappointed but resigned would pay the fees. Miss Payne, now on a
much reduced budget, was forced to take a computer course to update her office skills and enter the
job market. Mrs. Bascombe was at another place of employment where the pay was good. She was
not required to work on weekends and bank holidays. The rest of the family continued to give
Ondré all the love and support they could muster. As for Ondré and Theodore, their bond of
friendship grew stronger still after their successful ambush of Miss Payne’s plans for the Eleven Plus.
