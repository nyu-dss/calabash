Time passed. It did not seem possible that Ondré and Theodore could be old enough to attend
nursery school. For the first time they were separated. Ondré was taken to a Government run day
nursery by Mrs. Bascombe before work and Theodore was driven to a private establishment by Miss
Payne, in a Toyota donated by his father. “He will get more individual attention there”, declared Miss
Payne to Mrs. Bascombe, who nodded grimly and said nothing. She needed her salary. All her
daughters were now in secondary school.

The boys continued to be fast friends. Miss Payne attributed Theodore’s slower pace of learning
to “Superior teaching techniques which concentrated on more grounding and repetition”. Mrs.
Bascombe only nodded.

Then it was time for primary school. Ondré “went cross” to the primary school attached to his
nursery. Theodore was registered at a nine hundred dollar a term private school where “the classes
were smaller”. Mrs. Bascombe nodded.

The boys now resembled each other so much that strangers took it for granted that they were
twins, and respective family friends frequently mistook one for the other. They ignored the coldness
between their mothers and became closer still.

When Theodore entered Junior Two Miss Payne added lessons once a week to supplement his
education and to increase his father's bills. By Junior Three he was attending every day after school.
By Junior Four he was going on Saturdays as well. Ondré had always been top of his class. He had
joined the Public Library, and did extra work on his own “for fun”. Mrs. Bascombe smiled proudly,
and again said nothing.

Miss Payne was seriously worried. The eleven plus loomed near. Theodore’s father had attended
a prestigious school and was expecting Theodore to follow in his footsteps. He also wanted to see
some returns for his years of expensive fee paying. Miss Payne no longer had long, carefully
manicured nails. They were bitten nearly down to the quick.

By now both boys wore glasses Ondré’s myopia was hereditary — Mrs. Bascombe was also
shortsighted. Theodore’s condition resulted from too many lessons. Naturally the frames were almost
identical, the boys insisted on that, although Theodore’s cost three hundred dollars and Ondré’s less
than half of that. His oldest sister was now working and helped to foot the bill.

As the days passed Miss Payne became more and more thoughtful, and as a result Mrs. Bascombe
grew more and more worried. In the past, when Miss Payne grew thoughtful trouble usually
followed. More efficient cobwebbing could be demanded — Mrs. Bascombe hated spiders — or the
ever present threat of forfeited Bank Holidays, or work on Saturday afternoons. Miss Payne had
other things on her mind besides housework, however. Yolanda Payne was a woman with her
Theodore’s future — and her own — constantly on her mind. Mrs. Bascombe grew more

apprehensive. She went as far as telling her husband that as the first girl was now working, she would
seek a less lucrative job, and they would still manage.
