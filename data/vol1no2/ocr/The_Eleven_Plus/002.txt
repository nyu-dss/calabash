watched for her brother’s ancient cream-coloured Morris, it seemed only natural to exchange a few
words and show-off their babies to each other. As they drew closer together and simultaneously
adjusted the angles of their arms to better display their newborns, it was comical to see the two
women, so different to look at, with identical expressions of astonishment on their faces. “But he is
de whole uh Ondré!” exclaimed Mrs.Bascombe, who found her voice first.

“Anybody would take them for brothers,” affirmed Miss Payne. On discovering that the boys not
only shared the same date of birth, but were delivered at exactly the same time, their wonderment
increased. Miss Payne even let slip her air of condescension for a moment, at this seeming miracle.

Further conversation between the two women revealed that Miss Payne needed an experienced
person to help with Theodore, while Mrs. Bascombe was in urgent need of another source of
income to supplement her husband's salary, and help to provide for their five children, Telephone
numbers were hastily exchanged as the awaited vehicles slowed down under the covered walkway
in front of the hospital.

Thus it was, that exactly three week after the births, Mrs. Mildred Bascombe found herself
appointed maid to Miss Yolanda Payne. She was allowed to bring baby Ondré to work, and
everybody was wellsatisfied with the arrangement. It was just as well that Ondré was such a
contented baby, as bothwomen had their hands full with Theodore. He drew up his small knees to
his abdomen as pain as cholic wracked his little body. As fast as his formula was in, it was out. Miss
Payne blankly refused to try breast feeding after her early failure, despite Mrs Bascombe’s efforts to
persuade her, and despite the living, breathing proof of its benefits — little Ondré Bascombe.

Fortunately the cholic disappeared after four weeks and both babies grew apace. It soon became
apparent, however, that Ondré was reaching all the milestones of development before Theodore.
Whether it was the close contact of his mother as she fed him, the breast milk itself or numerous
eager hand and voices around him at home, he smiled, rolled over, sat up, crawled and explored his
toys and surroundings long before Theodore. When the differences became too obvious to ignore,
Miss Payne first concerned, then anxious, then disturbed, began to change in attitude to Mrs.
Bascombe. She began by dropping the “Mrs” when she addressed her, them by adding extra tasks
to her already full work load. She took to glancing sideways as the babies played side by side and
her expression would sour as Ondré scooted across the smooth parquet tiles as Theodore was content
to watch him, then follow at a leisurely pace.

Despite Miss Payne’s envious attitude and vindictiveness to Mrs. Bascombe, and Mrs. Bascombe's
grim acceptance of the situation, the boys loved each other with a passion seldom demonstrated
even in twins, They howled when they were out of sight of each other. Mrs. Bascombe’s departure
with Ondré at the end of her day’s work became a constant battle. Eventually, even the somewhat
shallow Miss Payne was touched by their devotion, and grudgingly admitted to herself that it wasn't
Ondré’s fault that Theodore could not keep up with the other child.
