Calabash

Ai, African, African

Where are you?

Are you still with us? —Gone?
Going, going, gone!

Replacing, you did, pulverized bodies
Indians: suffered, broken, died —dust
You carried the rocks that had crushed Indian pride

You handled the sharp flints that had cut Indian imagination
To pieces, you transformed the shapeless

Stones to huge colonial houses, dug

The wells while infernal heat hit home

Wells of wealth for slave

Owners, graves for the African bodies turned skeletons.

Ai, African, African —Where are you?
Are you still with us? — Going, going, gone!

You toiled and moiled to serve the slave

Owner, that abused you, your kids, your wives
Laboured, ploughed, snowing heaven

On earth for the slave

Owner, creating hell for you to live in and die

At the dead of night, holding your breath, you,
Mournful yet relieved, would find the trees bent against
And brood over the tambu of your being

Brooding, brooding

Cut off, chopped off, uprooted

Indians were, Africans were

Ripped, unearthed, torn away

From their soil, sucked away from their waters
Their sun blocked out

You bled, blood, bleeding

You were, night and day, bloodshed, blood
Gushing, spouting

Soiling Indian skins

Soiling African skins

The skins of slaves and the slaves they bore.
