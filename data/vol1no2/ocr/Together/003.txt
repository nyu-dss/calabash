Calabash

African ... Indian

Indian ... African

Where are you? Where have you gone to?
Going, going, gone!

Blood, sweat, tears of Indians, of Africans
Mixed, mingled with European sperm, muddled
Blended as colours do

And created Antillean man

Caribbean Antillean man and woman.

Rise! Raise your heads!
Do not stare at these bloody navel strings of yours
Bind them up, tie them together

Blood will congeal, heal
It will.

Look! Curacao, there you are!

We welcome you, Bonaire!

Saint Martin, am I glad to see you!
Oh my, you too, Sabal

You made it! Statial

Come join us, Aruba! Do!

We're on the road. We are
The Antilles are

The Caribbean islands are, have
The same past

The same history

The same oppression

The same struggle

We have

The same hope and future
Haven't we?

We have; Antilles
Caribbean come closer
Join us, Embrace
Together

Finally.
