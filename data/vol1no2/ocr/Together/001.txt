Together

Indian, Ai, Indian, where are you?
Where are you hiding, Indian?
Once you were

Here, but you're gone now
Where here —once

Gone?

You were surprised by cannons

Trampled upon by leather boots, you were
Left bathing in blood, open wounds

You were enslaved

Red slaves, you were

Indian, Ai, Indian, where are you now?
Where have you gone to?
Going, going, gone!

Go! Leave from here! Be gone! — they ordered.
Behind your head, curve your bodies

Bow your backs, carry the loads — the command.
You willed it not, you refused

Agile bodies, poised

Attuned to hunting and fishing

Succumbed, burst and turned to dust

Dust ... Indian

Indian ... dust ... dust ... gone

Africans replaced the pulverized Indian bodies

African bodies cut loose from their umbilical cords
Snatched away from tribal societies with Zumbi and Nanzi
Flung on the coasts of Caribbean islands.
