Vampire Fleeing Approaching Light

Sad unhappy parasite

Facing the cracked mirror of reckless vanity
Pioneering jagged borders of everyday sanity
A battered soul to endure

Dressed in yesterday’s couture

Bloodshot eyes behind spectacles dark
Driving a stake through his ageing heart

Once fed with a golden spoon

Chasing shadows through golden rooms

Fathers ghosts in stocks and bonds

Mothers jewels on the unmade bed scattered

Empty bottles on the floor remain

Sticking needles into a blue blooded vein

Silently screaming inside his bleeding brain battered

Black chauffeur waiting

Inside the golden limousine

Cruising the sauna’s dark room disco queens
Fearless victim with dripping fangs

Leftover groupie of one night stands
Dissolving into mourning light

Sad unhappy parasite.
