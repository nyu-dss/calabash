work at the House of Nehesi Publishers, seeking out and publishing new literary talent, places him
at the very apex of a new generation of writers who look up to him as an inspiration.

With regards to his publishing activity, I stated in my keynote address at the official simultaneous
launching of Kamau Brathwaite’s latest volume of poetry Words Need Love Too and of the Spanish
translation of George Lamming’s Coming, Coming Home: Conversations II' at CARIFESTA VII in St.
Kitts that the St. Martin experience shows that “before the establishment of House of Nehesi
Publishers, very few St. Martin writers had been published and the one or two of them who ventured
into self-publishing had to peddle their works among friends and family, and even had to give away
their books. Today, there are about a dozen writers, whose works were published for the first time
by House of Nehesi, and their works can be found in bookstores, the larger supermarkets, gift stores
and even in the hands of newspaper vendors! Some of their publications have been sold out and
reprinted, and at least three are being used as text books in universities in the USA and Canada. Book
parties such as this one to launch new titles have become an important part of the cultural calendar
of the island, and continue to attract hundreds of people, who come ready to purchase the books.” !4

What Sekou the prolific poet may have given up in terms of the quantity of his literary
productions, due to his work as a publisher, he has no doubt gained in the maturity and quality of
his work as well as in the inspiration he offers to others. In fact, a Sekou-school is discernible with
disciples such as Drisana Deborah Jack and Esther Gumbs who have both imbued their quiet
political radicalism with a poignant and determined poetic rebellion.

JACK DESCRIBES HER OWN REBELLIOUS SPIRIT THUS:

an errant thread

a flower gone dead

a squeaky-hinged door

a bend in the way

a rainy sun day

a lazy eye

a sea gone dry

a weathered cheek

a child that won't speak. !

Jack’s first and only book to date, The Rainy Season (1997), also contains some very brief short
stories, including the one that gave the book its title, that should actually be read as prose-poems.
