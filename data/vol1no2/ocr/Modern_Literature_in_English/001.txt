Modern Literature in English
in the Dutch Windward Islands:
A Brief Introduction'

HE VERY DEFINITION OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE THREE

Caribbean islands that comprise the so-called Dutch Windward Islands indicates that things are
not what they may seem to be. This is true also for the literature that is produced on the three
territories—Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Martin.2 The three tiny islands actually lie leeward and should
consequently have been known as the Dutch Leeward Islands. However, with the Dutch West India
Company headquartered in Curagao, the view from down there was obviously different. Similarly,
the fact that they are Dutch colonies would logically lead to the assumption that the literature
produced there would be in Dutch. As a matter of fact, literature in Dutch on the three islands is
virtually non-existent, although among new arrivals from Curacao and Holland in particular, there
have been some writers dedicated especially to producing children’s books. Nevertheless, it can safely
be stated that there is no current writer of any repute writing in the Dutch language on any of the
three islands. The language issue, as we shall later see, plays a central role in the creative output of
those engaged in any form of literary production on the islands.

In historical terms, literature in the Dutch Windward Islands has roots in the oral tradition of the
territories in a manner similar to that which obtains in the wider Caribbean. However, Wycliffe Smith
(1981) notes that “very little has been done to preserve the oral literature of the Windward Islands.”
Twenty years later, nothing has changed substantially with regards to that observation. He similarly
warned that “impinging cultural forces from abroad are slowly eroding the cultural heritage” of these
territories.

The “cultural forces from abroad” to which Smith alludes include the pervasive influence of
American pop culture via music (radio and lately MTV and BET on cable television) as well as movies
