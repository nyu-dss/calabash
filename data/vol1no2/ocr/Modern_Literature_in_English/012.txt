lecture to mark the anniversary of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Nobody has been able to
experiment and come up with fresh linguistic formulas for that laboratory like Sekou. The constant
code switching from Standard English to St. Martin English to Spanish (and even Papiamento,
Kwéyol, Dutch, and French) and back has become a trademark of Sekou’s. And rather than stultify
or render his poems or narrative difficult to understand, this recourse enhances his message and
boosts his aesthetics. He achieves this because it is not a stylistic embellishment but a respectful
exploration of the “St. Martin talk.”

 

m CONCLUSION

 

FROM WYCLIFFE SMITH TO LASANA M. SEKOU AND THE EMERGING “SEKOU
school,” the modern literature of the Dutch Windward Islands has grown by leaps and bounds,
quantitatively and qualitatively, to make it deserving of more serious critical attention. The voices of
the authors resonate with unbridled imagination, with battle-thirsty eyes set on reclaiming their land,
with an impassioned and blood-bonding integrationist kinship to the rest of the Caribbean. The

time has come to listen to their songs with eager ears.
