» NOTES: a

This brief overview of literature in English in the Dutch Windward Islands is based on an earlier article
published in the literary journal Callalloo, 21.3 (1998) under the title, “Introduction to Literature in English
in the Dutch Windward Islands” and on the article, “Lasana M. Sekou: The Renaissance Muse,” published in
the book St Martin Masstve! A Snapshot of Popular Artists, House of Nehesi Publishers, Special Edition, St.
Martin, 2000, pp. 21- 27.

The 37-square mile island is in actual fact divided between the Dutch and the French. The Dutch spelling
“Sint Maarten” was adopted in 1946, as a way of the colonialists claiming the “Dutchness” of the part of
the island that falls directly under Dutch rule. Before then, the whole island was referred to as “Saint Martin”
which is also the French spelling of the name purportedly given to the island by Christopher Columbus.
Since this coincides with the English spelling of the name, (although the pronunciation is obviously
different) and seeing that English is the mother tongue of the predominantly Black island population, this
has become the preferred spelling used by the more progressive minds. The official Dutch spelling however
remains “St. Maarten.” For the purposes of this paper, however, we shall maintain the English spelling. And
though we shall continue to refer to the three island territories as “The Dutch Windward Islands,” this paper
focuses mainly on St. Martin, the largest of the three, which has witnessed not only a tourist boom, but a
cultural renaissance of sorts, exemplified in a great increase in literary production on the island.

Sekou's monologue, “Casino Man” which appears in Nativity and Monologues for Today (House of Nehesi, St.
Martin, 1988) was adapted for the stage as a one-character play by Fabian Badejo in 1997. The play, starring
actress Sylvina Gumbs, was performed to rave reviews in St. Martin and Curacao that same year, Badejo has
since written and directed a full-length play, “The Bad that Man and Woman Do,” (1999) based on the
monologue of the same title by Sekou, Other monologues in the book have also been performed in St. Martin.
