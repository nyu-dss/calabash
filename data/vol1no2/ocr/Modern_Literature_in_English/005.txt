HODGE IS PERHAPS THE MOST NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO THIS GENERAL TENDENCY,
often employing classic rhyme patterns in his poetry. He can also be considered the island’s nature
poet par excellence. In “Green Hills of St. Martin” he extols the natural beauty of the hills, but
laments that they are being defaced by excessive quarrying. For him, apparently only Divine

intervention would be able to put an end to such “desecration.”

The green hills of St. Martin rise

In regal splendor to the skies,

Veiled by the mists of dawning day
As light and shadow dance and play
Across th’ eternal slopes serene

And golden valleys in between
Oblivious to the noisy flow

And struggle of man’s world below

Oh Lord by whose supreme decree

These hills once reared untouched and free
We pray that Thou may grant some sense
To those who wreak this vile offense,

And stay the all-destroying hand

That desecrates this noble land,

So that her riches may adorn

Her generations yet unborn.8

Hodge's rhymes become less labored, less stilted, as he turns his talents to singing the praises of
several island beauties in his love songs. Sylvina Gumbs is the “fairest rose that ever blossomed/From
nature’s loving toil.” Gracita (Arrindell’s) smile and eyes are all he can recollect from the hard-fought

1994 constitutional referendum campaign.

I've tried but cannot recollect
Which option won the prize,

Yet every moment brings to mind
Gracita’s dancing eyes.?
