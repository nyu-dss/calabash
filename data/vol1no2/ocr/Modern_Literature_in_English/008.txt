With an uncanny talent for subtle irony, Jack writes of the numbing effects of colonialism and
materialism that have seemingly conspired to abort the dream of political freedom from the womb
of the St. Martin nation:

so we stayed together

my tribe and i

living without a dream
settling for comfortable reality
even if

the comfort wasn’t ours

because we believed the lie

that

free thought would enslave us
and

the grave would be our summit!6

But she would throw a defiant challenge later:

i dare you to dream

i dare you to dream of songs
sung and unsung

ancient and unborn

songs of rebellion

songs of freedom

of love and loss

of protest and peace!”

Calling Jack’s tone that of “an activist, a fighter,” Alain Richardson writes in the introduction to
the volume that she is the “classic angry youth, rebellious yet profound and with a cause,” and Lorna
Goodison welcomes her “strong new voice which has come to join the chorus of inspired chanting
of Caribbean women poets.”!8
