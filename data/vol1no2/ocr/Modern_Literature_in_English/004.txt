BUT WHAT HAS WITHOUT DOUBT CONTRIBUTED TO WHAT CAN BE REFERRED TO
as a “literary renaissance of sorts’ particularly in St. Martin, is the establishment of the small
publishing outfit, House of Nehesi Publishers, which has published every one of the writers
mentioned above, with the exception of Smith.> For the first time in the history of the island, a
professional publishing house, under the leadership of Sekou, has been able to gain the confidence
of budding writers. Quickly establishing a reputation for itself as a serious publisher of quality
books, House of Nehesi has become the major catalyst in the development of literature on the
islands.

Although plays of Caribbean masters such as Derek Walcott (who has family links to St. Martin)
and Trevor Rhone, have had lasting influence on the local playwrights and theater-goers, only a
couple of playwrights have had their works published.6 For example, plays by Smith, Linda
Richardson, and Louie Laveist, all of St. Martin, and Miriam Schmidt in St. Eustatius, have not yet
been published, although some of them have been performed with great success on the islands and
abroad. Only Guyanese-born playwright-actor-director Ian Valz, who has made St. Martin his home,
has published an award-winning full-length play, Masquerade (1988).7 This does not mean however
that theater is not popular on the island. As a matter of fact, it has enjoyed quite some vibrant
periods, especially with the works of Valz, Laveist, Sekou and this writer, as well as the immense
contributions of theater groups such as the Cole Bay Theater Company, the Independent Theater
Company, Theater International, the United Theater Company, Qualichi Players, et al, some of them
now dormant or defunct, but all of which staged plays of both local and foreign writers that were
well-received by audiences on the islands and beyond.

IN GENERAL, THE WRITERS CAN BE GROUPED IN TERMS OF THEIR POLITICAL
commitment and ideological inclinations or in terms of their style. Smith in Winds Above the Hills (the
first and to date, only published anthology of Dutch Windward Islands verse) classified the authors
thematically: those who wrote about nature, those who wrote “patriotic” or “nationalistic” verse, and
those who wrote religious and love poems. In addition, he identified “identity” poetry. However, most
of these authors defy being pigeonholed—they tackle all kinds of themes, though they often show
a predilection for a particular style. Most of them write in free verse, avoiding rhymes and relying
more on rhythm and imagery to convey their messages.
