Inspired by a Renaissance Muse, Sekou’s writing is imbued with a sense of urgency, and a
passionate, serious appeal for love and unity as the pillars upon which a new St. Martin, a new
Caribbean nation, should build its progress and prosperity. Sekou is a soldier for peace and unity, for
love and compassion, launching his powerful guided verbal missiles against every target of
colonialism and divisiveness. He is an unapologetic, unrelenting, and indefatigable freedom fighter,
using all resources of his abundant talent to fire up his people, to big up the nation, to water the
seeds of independence, and light up the torch of self-pride. He has discovered the taste of freedom
in the sweat, blood, and tears that swelled the salt ponds of St. Martin; he has un-earthed the
unifying symbols—buried in the heap of ignorance and suppressed by centuries of slavery and
colonialism—to place them in the hands of a new generation like liberating flags that no gale can
blow away.

From Moods for Isis — Picturepoems of Love C7 Struggle (1978) to Brotherhood of the Spurs, Sekou has
created a body of work, which has been attracting increasing critical attention. Some of them like
Love Songs Make You Cry (1989), his first collection of short stories, Nativity (1988), and Brotherhood
of the Spurs have been used as texts in literature and history courses at several universities.

Whether in poetry or prose, Sekou deploys a rich and powerful imagery, in the same way Shaka,
the Zulu, or Toussaint LOuverture, the Haitian “Opener,” must have deployed their conquering
armies, with style and intelligence—victory being their only goal. His voice rises above the mundane,
far above the pedantic, and curls up like a smoke signal to all the sleeping warriors of the nation,
calling them to arms, telling them that there can be no victory without love and labor. The beautiful
Black woman that people the muse’s youthful poems in For the Mighty Gods ... An Offering (1982) or
Images in The Yard (1983) and the ever-present youth are not only poetic personae, but also real
torchbearers of a new dawn.

In continuing the oral tradition, which nurtures his poetics, Sekou’s lyrical poetry, and epic verse
as in “Nativity,” are not meant only for the pages of a book, but are alive when read aloud. This long
performance poem places him in the orbit of the great Caribbean poet, Kamau Brathwaite, not only
in form, but in content as well. Nobody recites his work better then the poet himself. His recitals are
dramatic performances, which always has his audiences spellbound. The gift of oratory, of flawless
delivery, obviously runs through Sekou’s blood, as his father, the legendary journalist, publisher, and
politician José Husurell Lake, Sr. was an acclaimed public speaker. Sekou’s brother, publisher Joseph
H. Lake, Jr, is well known for his powerful, pulpit-like public addresses. His maternal grandfather,
Thomas E. Duruo, was a leading Garveyite and, said the late patriot Felix Choisy, one of St. Martin’s
three great orators of the 20' century.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Sekou’s literary output is his refreshing and daring use of
language. He himself has described the polyglot and cosmopolitan nature of St. Martiners as an asset
yet to be fully developed. “The whole of St. Martin is a language laboratory,” he said in a 2000
