island from the throes of colonialism, to speak of her thirst for change, change, which according to
her, “will make us hunger for a fight/fight to overcome/alles dat staat verkeerd.” Lamenting the
erosion of traditional values, she writes with a tone of disappointment:

we don’t love anymore

my people

my children

we don't seek neighborhood gatherings

like we used to
we don’t comb the soil of each other’s hair roots
while soaking our flesh with melee and melee

like we used to,1?

centrifugal rage within churns below the surface and the verses come up from the challenge of the

WITH TWO COLLECTIONS OF POETRY—Golden Voices of S'maatin (1989) and Floral Bouquets
to the Daughters of Eve (1995), Bute has established a reputation for herself as a fine, mellow poetic
voice devoid of any revolutionary ambitions. The first woman to publish a volume of poetry in St.
Martin, Bute had already become renowned for her paintings. Poetry for her is not just another
creative endeavor, but an extension of the palette and the canvas. Her thematic focus is on women’s
issues—particularly the proverbial strength of the Afro-Caribbean woman—the preservation of

of folk tales and an art teacher who has been nurturing the talents of a new generation of St. Martin

and culture finds resonance in her poems as well as in her paintings.

She was chosen as the “overall favorite artist” of St. Martin in a survey commissioned by the
House of Nehesi Publishers in 1999, due in part to the best-seller status of her first volume of
poetry, Golden Voices. Bute, referred to as “the first dame of St. Martin’s cultural arts”2! is at peace

with herself as a woman, as an artist, as a chronicler of a way of life that is being devoured by crass
