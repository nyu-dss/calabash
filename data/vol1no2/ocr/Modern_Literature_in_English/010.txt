materialism and fierce competition. She writes in the opening poem of her second volume of poems,
Floral Bouquets:

I am very pleased
With all the cards
Life has dealt me

Never have I felt so at ease with myself,
Like the smell of sweet outdoor cooking,

Watching flames dance among the coals?

Writing about Bute’s central theme of women in the foreword to Floral Bouquets, Daniella Jeffry?
states that she “celebrates life in its most trying forms” and adds: “The autobiographical flavor of her
analysis adds sincerity and profundity to the reality which she depicts with truth and forcefulness.”
That “autobiographical flavor” and a relaxed, even conformist attitude to life, permeates the writings
of Bute.

AMIRI BARAKA WOULD BE MIGHTILY PROUD OF THE POETIC TALENT OF ONE OF
his most outstanding students—Lasana M. Sekou; and so would George Lamming, who, alluding to
Sekou’s Pan-Caribbean (and Pan-African) commitment, said of his second volume of short stories—
Brotherhood of the Spurs (1997}—‘it is his skillful interplay of (ancestral) memory and imagination
which allows Sekou to take us across oceans and diverse cultures, domestic turbulence and territorial
rivalries, without any feeling of rupture or discontinuity in the central theme of the narrative, which
is the discovery and collective self-realization of a Caribbean people, whether their acquired
identification be with St. Martin, Aruba, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Haiti, St. Thomas,
Trinidad, Antigua, Saba, Anguilla. There is room for all in this imaginary family which has made of
archipelago probably the first example of a global village.”24

In fact, continuity, commitment, a strong sense of identity, of brotherhood, of family—all these
elements are among the strong currents that propel Sekou's imagination and links him—through
memory and imagination—to the Harlem Renaissance and to the well spring of tradition-literary
and cultural—that has catapulted him to the forefront of a new breed of Caribbean writers.

Sekou, a James Michener Fellow, is in essence a Renaissance writer, who has leap-frogged into the

21st century with Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song” on his lips and the rich blood of all his ancestors
flowing through his veins into his pen.
