and Cable TV sitcoms and soap operas. But according to Smith, those forces also come from the rest
of the Caribbean. “Over the years,” he notes, “the folk literature of the Dutch Windward Islands has
become more and more imbued by West Indian and American influences. The calypso, reggae music,
and of late the Rastafarian movement have transformed the lifestyles of particularly the youth. The
American way of life, brought about by tourism and the mass media, is very evident in fashion,
music and consumer goods on the islands.”

Without diminishing the impact of these influences, Smith’s view however presupposes that the
islands had once been immune to such outside influences. This is, however, historically inaccurate.
From theit very inception, the three islands have indeed attracted foreigners from all parts of the
globe. As I have noted elsewhere with regards to St. Martin, the “open-shore, open arms acceptance
of foreigners forms a fundamental aspect of the character of the island. Being an island of
immigrants who, in turn have known the sweet and seamy sides of emigration, tolerance of
foreigners has become connatural to the inhabitants.”3 Foreign influences have therefore not been
inimical to the development of an authentic culture in the Dutch Windward Islands, nor have they
stultified the growth of this culture, as Smith seems to suggest, but rather have been (and continue
to be) the very strands ftom which an autochthonous culture has been woven (and continues to be

woven).

The difficulty in finding a body of literature that can be easily identified as being peculiar to St.
Martin and the other two Dutch Windward Islands is, in part, due to the erroneous approach of
trying to sift out those “cultural forces from abroad.” In other words, all attempts to define St. Martin
culture as something essentially separate and distinct from Caribbean culture is doomed to remain
an exercise in futility. It is, however, curious to note that, despite centuries of Dutch and French
domination, European influence continues to be minimal in comparison to the American and
Caribbean influences Smith observed.

With regards to literature, it is also noteworthy that a tradition of literary criticism has not fully
developed on the islands, with Smith being a lone pioneer in this area, although strictly speaking he
can be better classified as a literary historian. The development of literature has been inhibited by
this, although there are several capable critics on the island such as Daniella Jeffry, Napolina Gumbs,
Rhoda Arrindell, Alex Richards, Alain Richardson, etc. whose incisive critical comments have served

as introductions to several of the publications of House of Nehesi Publishers.
