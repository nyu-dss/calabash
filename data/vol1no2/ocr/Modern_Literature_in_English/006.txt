With passion burning in her panting breast;
Somewhere my princess dreams beneath her palms
Lulled by the music of the wind and sea,

While I afar bemoan her elf-like charms

And wonder if she sometimes thinks of me.!!

consider the canon of female beauty in “Those Big Bouncing Beauties” when he sings:

What others see in skinny girls
I'll never comprehend

I'll trade the whole bunch any day
For one plump lady friend. !2
