that virtually all the languages spoken in the Caribbean can be heard on St. Martin, St. Martiners
themselves are not really polyglots, even though they are often multi-lingual. They normally speak
English at home, study in Dutch (or French) at school, and often socialize in Spanish and/or
Papiamento, which many of them have learned as a result of having been born in Aruba or Curagao,
or having had to pursue further studies on those Papiamento-speaking islands. Their command of
these languages is, however, quite often suspect, while the fact that their mother-tongue is not the
official language of instruction at school often undermines their self-confidence in expressing
themselves especially in written English.4 As a result, they do not really speak nor write any of these
languages confidently enough nor at a very high level of proficiency to enable them to express
themselves creatively. It is no wonder then that those who have produced any tangible and
noteworthy body of literary work mainly studied in the United States of America. These include
“veteran” writers like Smith himself, who has written two volumes of poetry, the late Charles
Borromeo Hodge and younger writers such as Lasana M. Sekou and Drisana Deborah Jack.

There is another group of writers who, notwithstanding the educational system imposed on them,
have added their voices to the literature of the Dutch Windward Islands. These include the short
story teller and artist, Ruby Bute, who has published two volumes of poetry; actor-drummer and
poet Ras Changa; actor-director-playwright Louie Laveist and journalist-poet Esther Gumbs. The
two groups of writers use language quite differently, with the first exhibiting a great measure of self-
assurance, while the latter's works have apparently undergone quite a lot of editing, especially for
syntax and grammar. It is consequently understandable that out of the two groups, only Sekou, a
trained journalist and former editor of the island’s oldest newspaper, Newsday, and Smith, an
educator and former president of the University of St. Martin, have consistently written prose. Sekou
has two volumes of short stories and a collection of dramatic monologues to his credit, apart from
numerous newspaper and other scholarly essays and articles, while Smith has published the
pioneering survey of poetry in the Dutch Windward Islands, Windward Islands Verse (1981).

The language issue is certainly one of the most important reasons why the majority of the
published authors write mainly poetry. Many of them shy away from prose obviously because of the
language factor. They can quickly claim “poetic license” in their verse, when in fact it could be
“licentiousness” — a lack of adequate command of the English language that admittedly results
sometimes in a felicitous usage. In addition, the discipline, proficiency, and craft needed to write short
stories, plays or full-length novels may be lacking in some authors of poetry.

Recent educational changes have resulted in the use of English in a number of primary and
secondary schools as the language of instruction. Though slow in materializing, these changes,
coupled with a greater awareness of the role of language in the development of culture, as well as
the growth of the print media in the last two decades, have given rise to quite a lot of literary activity

on the islands.
