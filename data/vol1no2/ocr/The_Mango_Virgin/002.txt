Calabash

The fruit slipped over my lips. I chewed,

sweetness bathing my tongue and teeth like water.

I reached into my purse to pay, but he stopped me.

“No charge, m’lady. When you learn the mango’s secrets,
you come back to see me.” He smiled again then winked.

I walked away.

The sidewalks changed to clouds,
the human throngs

blurred to forests.

I brought the mango to my mouth
and sucked it softly.

I felt like the first woman

as I wandered on,

tasting God’s tongue,

moving towards a secret,

coming into the rest of my life.
