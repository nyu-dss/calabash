and the deepening hole of misery that they have dug for their adoring peasantry and urban masses.

In this particular piece, “The Landing”, I use my art as a means to express my interest in the way
that African culture intersects with and empowers the culture of the Americas to produce the modern
nations of the Caribbean and in particular the nation of Haiti. The fabulous world of spirits: old
and new, true and false, real and imagined, have made themselves felt at the different planes of social
and cultural consciousness that pervade the Caribbean. They come under many names: “Loas’,
“Espirits’, or “Mysteres” and they all convey a strong sense of intense empowerment which inspires
the fabulous nature of their symbolism. Where will we find Erzulie Freda Dahomey, the goddess of
love? In the local Haitian communities as they struggle against their neo-colonial government? Or,
is it possible that the fiery Ogun, god of war and steel, might offer his services to the people of Haiti
in their struggle against cultural imperialism? Perhaps, Azaka Medeh, thundering hero, might join
forces with the armies of migrant Haitians who come to live, labour and love in foreign cities like
Montréal and Miami.

I constantly depict these characters because they come from a land similar to the land of the
glaring sun in the tropics and they best can represent the struggle of the Haitian people. One of
their unique assets is that they are true to their origins and yet are willing partners in the drama of
Haitian identity-building. As points of focus they are excellent representatives of human frailties and
qualities: greed, hate and depravity constantly countered by love, courage and generosity. Those are
some of the attributes which make them so endearing to me. I have staged them over and over again
and never tire of doing so. My characters, like all good actors, relish the risks involved in their
representation. They are timeless and adaptable, easily placed against a New York skyline or on a
defiant raft headed into dangerous Caribbean waters. They are simple and easily readable yet they
represent the complex and multiple possibilities for Haitian personal identification: from the destitute

or the weary to the charming and mysterious, who are worthy protagonists of my artistic dramas.
