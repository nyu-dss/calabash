HE WORK FEATURED ON THE FRONT COVER OF CALABASH CAN BE DESCRIBED
T as the precusor to an installation of some of my work exhibited at the Miami Art Museum from
October 26, 2000 through February 21, 2000, entitled “Migrations”.

The piece is a thematic re-presentation of the forceful “voyage du non retour” (the voyage of
no return) undertaken a few centuries back by million of Africans who had only their gods and
their memories as their stolen baggage. In “The Landing” my cast of characters are a continuation
of the theme of the experience of slavery and displacement, contained most forcefully in the
horrors of the middle passage. The characters predate and foreshadow another, newer middle
passage in which we witness the disembarkment of waves of dislocated immigrants to the inner
coastline of Miami. In “The Landing” the cast is composed of a number of “loas” who, after a
perilous crossing, fix their attires so as to make a dignified “Entrée sur scene”. For the ones who
know Miami, the site of that landing is none other than the island causeway where pedestrians
are not allowed. Thus begins another chapter in the story of identity interrogation that is the
cultural inheritance of many immigrant Caribbean groups. The conditions and possibly the causes
of displacement may be different today, but these events suggest that we are watching the replay
of a kind of global politics in which Haitians constantly negotiate the physical space of America
that they are trying to call home.

But, you may say, all this talk is a talk of politics and an artist should be well cautioned to keep
at bay that kind of poetry about which there may be nothing poetic. However, given the political
disaster that Haiti represents today, I believe in the power of representation. I believe in the way in
which that power can contain and reverse the miscarriages within the political process that are taking
place in Haiti. I have tried to analyze the historical context of the genesis of my partial island nation
by examining the strife and suffering that brought a society of slaves and slave masters to the place
where aggression and cruelty seem inevitable in my island home. How does a nation develop patterns
that are easily learned and extremely resilient to alteration? Those patterns referred to are those of
extreme violence, the type that never looks back; the type that finds a certain comfort in its

inevitability. | have scrutinized the successive generation of tyrannical rulers, their sordid entourages
