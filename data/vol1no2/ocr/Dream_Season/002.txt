It rained

In wires

That pierced
The earth

Like syncopated
Notes.

Seeds foliated into words

That were the seasonâ€™s newest shoots
They opened syllables to the sun

It was a first communion with the word
Words flowered on every shoot

Shoots blossomed into poems.

In that season of green joy
The heart fed on fragile faith
While lidless slitted eyes
Gazed from the blooms

And scaled petals fell
Among shoots.

Ul

Then came the drought
Season of sparseness

It was time for neons
Flashing in the night

Love was

Measured by

The dropper

One

Drop could dull

The gnawing hunger's edge
