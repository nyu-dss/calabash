Dream Season

The snake’s in the garden again
It hides in the tall grass

Thinks I can’t see

But I know it’s there
Watching, waiting to come out
When I'm asleep.

I first dreamed it as a child

At the first seeding

When earth, still moist

With primordial rain

Yielded to the hand

That pressed the seed

To lie cocooned in fecund warmth.

Gliding

Beneath my bed
It

Wove charms
In its ophidian head
While I,
Hovering
Between sleep and wake
Feared my heart
Would follow enchanted
Labyrinthine paths
Across

The forest floor.
