Calabash

I was parched for love
The echoes of once brimming streams
Haunted every dream
And like the beat of some tympanic din
A faucet dripped

Drop

By

Drop
Into

The night.

IV

Snakes in the garden again

It's near the orange grove

Where ripened fruit

Weigh branches with their fullness
It slides along the grass

Where I can see

Round onyx eyes

Looking at me.

I dreamed it
A night ago
Twining
Among fallen
Fruit
Coils circling their roundness
While I hovering
Between
Sleep and wake feared
It
Had come
To haunt again
With its
Sinuous
Windings
