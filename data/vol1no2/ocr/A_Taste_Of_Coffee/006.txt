After assigning me the twin bed where her husband used to sleep, Aunt Ilyana goes out to the
mausoleum to say good night to her daughter.

“We have visitors,” she tells Marie Jeanne, “Miracin’s daughter, Nounoune, the journalist, she has
come to see us again.”

THE NEXT MORNING, I HELP AUNT ILYANA MAKE HER COFFEE IN THE COOKING
shed by the stream. I hold the swollen pouch, hanging from a rounded piece of coat hanger, while
she pours scalding water over the coffee powder. Uncle Joseph, Nick, and I map out the day over
coffee and cassava bread with Aunt Ilyana and her grandsons. There are more meetings for Nick and
Uncle Joseph with a builder they had hired to add two more rooms to the schoolhouse before the
fall. There are several teachers to interview for the new classes, and further curriculum planning
sessions with the headmistress, a woman in her thirties who is raising three toddlers alone since her
husband left for the Dominican Republic five years ago and never returned.

The school is Uncle Joseph's latest passion, the last thing he wants to accomplish, he says, before
he dies. He has zealously collected money from friends, family members, and missionaries to build
it so that some of the children of Beauséjour could at least learn to read and write.

We make our way en groupe to the schoolhouse. Aunt Ilyana watches closely while Uncle Joseph
gives special instructions to the headmistress and the builder. The headmistress puts in a plea for a
few more blackboards so that children on different levels could work independently. The
schoolmistress asks the builder to assure her a tin roof that wouldn't leak. She didn’t want to always
have to stop classes and send the children home when it rained.

After the schoolhouse, we walk over to the cemetery. The tombs are elegant in their wear and tear,
looking like massive marble sculptures among knee high weeds. Some of the names and dates,
carved deeply on some tombstones and more superficially on others, have faded. There are no dates
of birth for my great-grandmother Lovana Saint Lot. It is possible that her birth was never recorded
at all in any public papers. It may have been simply a private joy shared by her loved ones and their
friends who are no longer around to remember. My great-grandmother died during the American
occupation of Haiti, during a year too redundant to forget, 1919. My great-grandfather’s name was
Osnac Dantica—the t was added to my father’s birth certificate by mistake, giving my father and his
forebears a singular variation of the family name. Osnac Dantica died soon after his wife, my aunt
Ilyana tells us, but the year of his death has long faded from the tombstone.

The conversation that evening at supper turns quickly to those whose grave sites were nowhere
near the mountains and would never be. My grandfather, Nozial, who had joined the Cacos, a
nationalist militia which fought American marines during the occupation, decided after decades of

fearing another invasion that he would be in a better position to battle for Haitian sovereignty if he
