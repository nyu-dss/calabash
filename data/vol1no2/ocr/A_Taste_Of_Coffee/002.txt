With that label comes mixed implications. Of course, mountain people are fit and robust—they
have to be to travel such long distances to places of unmarked paths and slippery trails, places where
neither cars nor bicycles could tread. However, mountain people are also considered unsophisticated,
backwards, marooned from the larger society, exiled by destiny, if not by choice, from the urbanites
of the island. I have come to revisit these mountains from which our family has sprung, and which
have released us to different types of migrations. I have come to see just how far we have trekked
in less than two generations, from Beauséjour peyizan (peasants) to Brooklynites, from the valley to
skyscrapers. I have come to see an aunt whom I have seen only once before in my life, when I was
eight years old, because she has literally refused to come down from the mountain.

After a brief rest, I reclaim my mountain legs and continue on. Along the way, Nick and I retell
each other fragmented stories about our great-grandparents, vague tales that we had gathered from
older family members. Both my great-grandparents had lived in Beauséjour their entire lives, never
venturing further than Dabonne, the first big market town off the mountain. Together when they
married, they owned twenty acres of land and thirty pigs. Of the twelve children that my great-
grandmother had given birth to, only four had survived. My great-grandparents had spent their
whole lives without such luxuries as electricity, telephones, medical doctors, or morgues. When their
children had died at varying ages in childhood, they had buried them either the same day, or the
day after, for lack of said morgue.

As we crossed an arch or rock that formed a slanted bridge to the descent of the mountain, Nick
and I lament the fact that there was not more to say of our great-grandparents’ lives beyond these
inelaborate segments which could almost be true of anyone else who had lived here in these
mountains.

Before I came on this trip, I asked my father if he remembered anything else.

“Not much,” he said. “In those days, children didn’t sit down and chit chat with adults. You weren't
even allowed to look them in the eye.”

As children Nick and I had both come here, along with my brother André, to spend a week with
my aunt Ilyana, who is the last close family member still living in Beauséjour. Everyone else,
including my grandparents, had sold their share of the land and pigs after my great-grandparents’
death and had used the money to migrate, first to the Haitian capital and then to other parts of the
world. Unlike Nick, who makes his home in Port-au-Prince, I don’t remember the childhood journey
to the mountain in exhaustive detail. | remember skipping over what seemed like moles then,
compared to these endless series of cliffs and crags. I remember collecting dandelions as we passed
the gardens of people who called us by name, people of whom there is no longer any trace. I
remember plucking handfuls of vetiver and citronella, crushing them in my hand to inhale their
fragrance. I don’t remember the domes of bare rock. I don’t remember my aunt Ilyana’s house

looking so isolated from up high. I don’t remember the pain in my calves, the agony of every step.
