A Taste of Coffee

THINK THAT THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING TO KILL ME, THAT I WILL NEVER SEE
i the other side. We have been walking for four hours and suddenly I have a sharp piercing pain
in my side. My cousin Nick is about thirty feet ahead, hiking at a steady gait, following my uncle
Joseph who is struggling up a steep loma on a borrowed mule. We have been told that the mule
knows the way, instinctively, has made the journey several times before, but I haven’t, not for a while,
not since I was eight years old.

Nick suddenly stops and pulls a pack of cigarettes out of his shirt pocket. While lighting up, he
turns around to check on me. I am doubled over, hugging my mid-section, where the pain has spread
from my abdomen down to my thighs. I try some breathing exercises that I remember from medical
shows on television. But it is hard to concentrate. All I can think of, besides the pain, is my brother
André, who had emergency surgery for appendicitis a few weeks before in New York. What if the
same condition has suddenly befallen me, here on top of a mountain deep in the Haitian
countryside, where the closest village seems like a grain of sand in the valley below?

Nick walks over and puts a hand on my shoulder.

“Tired?” he asks.

I want to tell him that I am more than tired, but I am saving all my strength to ward off the pain.

“I think I'm dying,” I finally manage to say.

“No you're not,” he answers, drawing on his cigarette. “I was just like you when I came back here
for the first time in a while. All the walking is just catching up with your body. You'll be fine in a
minute.”

We stop to rest on a slickrock, too common on the eroded mountain range, take cover ftom the
scorching midday sun under a small, arched, wind-deformed tree. Just as Nick has predicted, my pain
slowly subsides while he finishes his cigarette. We watch as my uncle and the mule slowly descend
through a rift on the mountainside, towards our ancestral village, Beauséjour, where my paternal
great-grandparents are buried and where my aunt Ilyana still lives.

I have decided to come on this trip to relive a myth, to experience a family fable often recited in
just a few words. Nou se moun mon, my aunts and uncles—my father's siblings—like to say. “We are

mountain people”.
