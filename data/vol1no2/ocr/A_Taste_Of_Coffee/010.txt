The grief on my father’s face is clouded by logistical figurations. It had taken two days for news
of the death to travel to Port-au-Prince and then by telephone to us, which means that Aunt Ilyana’s
funeral has already been held. Attending the service, whichever kind had been chosen, is not even
an option.

Karl shrieks with pride when he finally succeeds at turning on the television set by himself and
I am grateful for the distraction, for having to run and save him from discoveries for which I do not
think he is ready.

He squirms as | hold him in my lap and try to quiet him down and I find that in my efforts to
keep him still—whispering his name in his ear, promising him sweets he'd never get, singing the
alphabet song he loved so much—that he is the one who is momentarily saving my father and me
from our sadness as our attention shifts back to him.

There is little to say, neither my father nor I can find the words, so I offer a confession instead.
This revelation also seems to interest young Karl as he watches my trembling lips.

I tell my father that on the last day of my visit to Beauséjour Aunt Ilyana had given me three
pounds of coffee for him, coffee which had been confiscated as “illegal agricultural transport” by
customs officers at John F Kennedy Airport in New York. I had not told him about the coffee before
for fear that he would grieve over something he would never have.

“You should have told me,” he says now, while reaching over and rescuing Karl from the tighter
grasp of my grief. “We sure need that coffee now.”

We certainly could have used it that day, Aunt Ilyana’s magic elixir, both to help us remember and
to forget.

When my father puts Karl back on the ground, he runs from us and immediately returns to the
TV set which he turns on again with glee. He stands there and stares in awe at the faces on the screen
then trots over to touch them. He seems heartbroken, it seems, to discover that the people are flat
and cold and cannot respond to him. Then he steps back and walks back to my father, grabbing his
knee and burying his face in his lap.

As my father's strokes young Karl's head, consoling his brief frustration, I realize that my way of
saying good-bye would never again be the same. I can not pretend that later in the day or the next
day or the day after I will see Aunt Ilyana. Some separations are impossible to endure without
becoming totally incapacitated with sadness. However I am lucky to have had Aunt Ilyana to walk
with me for a few miles, before she continued on.
