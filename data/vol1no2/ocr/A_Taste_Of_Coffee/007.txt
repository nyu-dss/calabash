and his three sons were in the capital. His wife, Miranize, and two of the daughters soon followed.
My grandparents’ death in old age would force their sons and daughters to buy their first piece of
property in the Haitian capital, a tomb in which to bury their parents.

Towards the end of the meal, with all the talk of the dead, I announce that when I die, I want
to be buried in Beauséjour.

“Where would you find someone to carry you this far?” asks Aunt Ilyana. “First from New York,
to Port-au-Prince, and then this two day road up the mountains. It would be a lot of carrying.”

I assure her that there would be less carrying if I were cremated and my ashes scattered from the
peak of one of the mountains.

“There is already enough dust in Haiti,” she says. “You should be buried where you die.”

Where I die will probably not be here in this place, unless the descent from the mountain proves
as fatal as I believed the climb might be.

“Enough now,” says Aunt Ilyana. “This is too much talk about dying.”

IN HER ROOM, IN THE DARK, LISTENING TO AUNT ILYANA HOLD WHAT SOUNDS
like entire conversations in her sleep, [ realize that aside from blood, she and I share nocturnal habits.
I too speak my dreams aloud to the point of jolting myself awake with the sound of my own voice.
Usually I can only remember the very last thing I say, but remain with this feeling that I have been
talking, laughing, and at times crying all night long.

Our last two days in Beauséjour would proceed like all family reunions are supposed to, with the
awe of reconnecting with a loved one slowly replaced by subtle gestures, unexpected smiles and
kisses, nods of recognition of carriage and demeanor that seem oddly familiar to one’s own skin.
Uncle Joseph and Cousin Nick lose themselves in the details of the school while Aunt Ilyana and |
talk less and less, to avoid, I suspect, speaking of separation. There are already so many separations
in our family, constant departures from people as well as places. Now se moun mon could now also mean
that we are nomads, constantly leaving and returning to these mountains either in actuality or in our
dreams. However, we could not afford to curse or avoid these exits and migrations because they have
earned us whatever type of advancement we seem to have made in life. Aunt Ilayna’s son for example
had to spend most of his life away from her in order to become a dentist. While her daughter Marie
Jeanne who stayed behind died an agonizing and prolonged death, showing Aunt Ilyana that some
departures were inevitable, which is why Marie Jeanne’s children now live in the capital with their

father’s relatives and only visit Beauséjour in the summer.
