THE NIGHT BEFORE WE ARE TO LEAVE, I AM LYING ON MY BACK IN THE BED
where Aunt Ilyana’s husband used to sleep listening to her chatter in her sleep. Mid-dreams, she
laughs and makes promises and gives warnings, “Listen, don’t go too far. Stay away from that water.
The soup is too hot. Come back soon. I'll send you coffee.”

She suddenly sits up in bed and scolds herself. “Ilyana, you are waking the girl.” And then drifts
into it again, this movie in her head. And in the dark, I imagine—I pray—that from here she can
talk to all of us across these long distances, to my father, her parents, my brothers, and their children.
And while I making this silent invocation, Aunt Ilyana awakens herself from yet another dream and
whispers from across the room, “Nounoune, are you sleeping, Nounoune?”

I say, “No. But it is not you who is keeping me awake.”

“Oh?”

It is the mountains maybe, it being so quiet here at night that you hear everything, the swing of
every tree branch, the bubbling of the stream, the footsteps of night travelers and wandering
animals. And I listen for everything because I know it won't always be so. I listen too closely and

sometimes the listening gets too loud.

THE NEXT MORNING AS WE ARE PREPARING TO LEAVE, AUNT ILYANA PRESENTS ME
with a three pound sack of coffee grains to bring to my father in Brooklyn.

“When he has a taste of this coffee,” she says, “it will bring him home.”

I marvel at the magic of this coffee of which Aunt Ilyana is so certain. What if such a thing did
exist, an elixir against fading memories, a panacea to evoke images of spaces lost to us, to instantly
return us to those spaces and them to us. I thank Aunt Ilyana for the coffee on my father’s behalf by
telling her a story, something I knew about him and she didn’t. I tell her of going with my father
to a Chinese herbalist who was treating him for psoriasis and of the Chinese herbalist telling my
father to stop drinking coffee or he would never be cured. And of my father saying, “Doctor, there
must be another way” because he would never give up coffee. And in one of those strange, crossed
wire moments, I give Aunt Ilyana pause with my story, and she says that perhaps she shouldn't send
the coffee to my father if it meant that he would have psoriasis forever. 1 must convince her to give
me the coffee again and finally she does.

WE START OUT AT FIVE A.M. FOR OUR JOURNEY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. OUR PLAN
is to be halfway down by eleven a.m. before the sun gets too high in the sky, making it too hot to
walk without fainting. We will stop briefly for lunch at the house of a friend of my uncle’s and then
hike the rest of the afternoon, which will mean that we will be in Port-au-Prince around seven or
