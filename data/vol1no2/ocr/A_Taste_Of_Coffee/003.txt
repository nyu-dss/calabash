When I say this to Nick, he replies, “Perhaps it is because you were lighter, because you were a
little girl.”

We meet up with Uncle Joseph on the descent as he stops for a rest of his own. He offers the
borrowed mule to Nick who barely escapes a kick on the groin as he tries to mount the animal.

“This is why I have never been on one of those,” I say.

“You've just never been tired enough,” replies Uncle Joseph, who at seventy six years old, has been
coming to Beauséjour from the capital a couple of times a year to visit with Aunt Ilyana and see after
a small school that he has started here.

Uncle Joseph points out the one room school house down below. It looks tiny and blurry, no
different than the cemetery near it, the cluster of tombs, where my great-grandparents are buried.

WE REACH MY AUNT ILYANA’S HOUSE BY MID-AFTERNOON. NESTLED BETWEEN
a stream and a banana grove, it is a modest two-room home made of limestone walls and a tin
roof. It has not changed very much since Nick, André, and I came here as children, except that
the tin roof has been replaced a couple of times due to hurricanes. Aunt Ilyana lives alone now,
but her ex-husband has his own place nearby and he visits often as does her adult son, my cousin
Renel, who is a dentist in Port-au-Prince. Unlike my father, his brothers, and sisters, and Renel,
who followed my grandparents to the city, Aunt Ilyana remained behind with her thirty eight year
old daughter Marie Jeanne until Marie Jeanne had died the year before of AIDS — passed on to
her by a philandering husband — and Aunt Ilyana had entombed her oldest child and only
daughter in a beautiful turquoise mausoleum next to the house. In Marie Jeanne’s mausoleum is
reserved a place for Aunt Ilyana so mother and daughter can be together again in death as they
had always been in life.

Aunt Ilyana is not home when we arrive. Her grandsons, Marie Jeanne’s two teenage boys, who
are visiting from the capital for the summer, give us some water and a large sisal mat to collapse
on as we wait for her to return. We immediately crash on the front porch, in a cool spot close to
the wooden railing at the other end of which the boys are pouring dried corn kernels into a
grinder, turning them into bright yellow cornmeal. The boys are surrounded by twelve of Aunt
Ilyana’s prized hens and roosters who squawk loudly as handfuls of corn occasionally rain down
on their heads.

Aunt Ilyana arrives an hour or so later. She looks much younger than her seventy-six years. Her
skin is an even mahogany hue and her body looks taut and lean, almost muscular. She is wearing a
dark green dress and a black head wrap. She kisses Uncle Joseph and Cousin Nick hello, but having
not seen me in more than twenty two years does not recognize me. She lists the names of ten of my

girl cousins while trying to guess who I am. Finally Uncle Joseph says, “It’s Miracin’s daughter,
