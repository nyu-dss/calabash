Unlike Uncle Joseph who is a Baptist minister, Aunt Ilyana is not a particularly religious woman.
Every once in a while she had a pé savann, a mountain priest, come over to the cemetery to say a mass
over her grandparents’ graves, but only because she thought they had worked hard their whole lives
and would accept it as a sign of respect. However there were no masses said for Marie Jeanne who
was also Baptist, like my uncle.

Glimpsing over at Marie Jeanne’s mausoleum gleaming in the moonlight, I ask Aunt Ilyana why
she didn’t bury Marie Jeanne in the cemetery near Marie Jeanne’s great-grandparents.

“That cemetery belongs to a lot of people,” she says. “This place is just mine and hers and it’s
close to where we live. When I am gone, people are going to take over the family land that is left.
They already want to take it from me because I am the only one in the family here, but this place |
build for Marie Jeanne and me is big and heavy so maybe they will leave us alone.”

The people Aunt Ilyana is talking about are her few neighbors, friends and foe, who, by her
estimation, figure that because she has so many family members in the city and abroad she does not
need the land to live.

Changing the subject, Aunt Ilyana turns to me and says, “I forgot to ask you. How is Miracin’s
other daughter, the one who once came here as a girl? I hear she is a journalist and flies everywhere
in helicopters. What was her name again, Edwidge?”

Even though I have never flown in a helicopter, being my father's only daughter, and the only
Edwidge in the family, I know she is talking about me.

My uncle raises his eyebrows in concern, as though this odd question is proof of Aunt
Ilyana’s hidden senility. Nick hides a smile under a cupped hand and looks at me to see how I
will clarify this.

I simply say, “Aunt Ilyana, I am Edwidge, Nounoune. I am the same one who is here.”

She seems unconvinced, so I search my memory for concrete evidence of that past visit with her.
Aunt Ilyana and her husband were still together then, though sleeping in twin beds on opposite sides
of their room. Marie Jeanne had been a shy, but hardworking young woman. She and Aunt Ilyana
had spent almost every moment of their days together. They woke up at dawn and fetched water
from the stream, made coffee for the household and everyone else who came by, sprinkled the yard
with water, and swept it with sisal brooms that made a swooshing music, like a fan concert. I
wandered around the yard all day, played hide and seek and hopscotch, jumping jacks with rocks,
with the area girls while my cousin Nick, my brother André, and Aunt Ilyana’s husband went to
work in the fields. Twice a day Aunt Ilyana, Marie Jeanne, and I would bathe in the lower end of
the stream, which was stinging cold in the morning and lukewarm in late afternoon. I was not
allowed to do any more work than shell peas, sort out tiny pebbles from the newly harvested rice,
or the bad corn kernels from the grinder batch. This because I was a city girl and the other types of
work were considered too strenuous for me.
