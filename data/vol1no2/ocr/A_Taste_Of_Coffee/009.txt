Calabash

eight in the evening.

The trip up took us two days, but Cousin Nick and Uncle Joseph assure me that it will be faster
going down since we are not stopping for the night. Besides with gravity it is always easier to
descend than to climb.

My way of saying good-bye is always the same. | pretend that later in the day or the next day or
the day after I will see the person to whom I am bidding farewell. It is the only way I can endure
separations, large and small, without becoming totally incapacitated with sadness, Aunt Ilayna’s way
is more abrupt and formal and perhaps healthier. We kiss each other on the cheek as she lists the
names of all the family members in New York to whom I should give her regards. She and the boys
walk with us for a mile or so and then they stop walking and we continue on.

The journey down is, as my cousin and uncle predicted, much easier. Rather than walk in a
straight line, I zig zag through the difficult roads, which is my uncle tells me, the way the peasants
climb and descend these mountains with relative ease. This is why they don’t look as tired as I do
when I finally reach Dabonne and climb with great relief into my cousin's truck. That and the fact
that they are used to it, my uncle says. “If you did this often enough you too would get used to it.”

I begin to worry about Aunt Ilyana on the ride back to the capital, imposing upon her life visions
of comforts that are even lacking in mine. I imagine her having her own helicopter with which to
travel to and from the market. I imagine her bypassing the stream baths for a Jacuzzi. I imagine her
on vacation, visiting places different family members have offered to her, but which she has refused:
the Statue of Liberty, Disney World, the Empire State Building. By our standards, she has seen very
little of the world, but perhaps, I tell myself, her world is larger than all of these places. I remind
myself that at least she has a simple life, which my younger cousins and I who live in the United
States and elsewhere are always trying to achieve in purposeful and arbitrary ways, by not buying
too many items of clothing, too many shoes, too much furniture, by delaying having children, so
we can be responsible for no one but ourselves. At the same time, Aunt Ilyana’s life seems far from
simple. Her vocation is no less than to maintain our family’s physical legacy, to guard the ancestral
village, sustain a far away world to which we can return and find traces, however, remote and faint,
of who we are.

When I find out that Aunt Ilyana is dead a few months later, I am babysitting my sixteen month
old nephew Karl, who has recently learned to walk. It is no longer easy to keep him still on one’s
lap during serious conversations, as he wants to get as much use of his newly discovered mobility as
possible by skipping from spot to spot, from my father’s knees to mine, ftom the living room sofa
to the window curtains, to the television set which we have placed on the floor and not on a teetering
table with his safety in mind. Karl is also exercising his fresh vocal abilities by shouting nonsensical
words and my father must compete with him as he says, “I had a call from Haiti just now and they
told me Ilyana died.”
