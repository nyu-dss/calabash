Nounoune.” (In the family, I am most commonly known by my nickname, Nounoune.)

“Ah, Nounoune,” Aunt Ilyana takes my face in her firm large hands. “Miracin’s daughter.”

Aunt Ilyana and Uncle Joseph exchange family news while Nick and I join in the corn grinding.
Occasionally Aunt Ilyana shouts questions to me about my parents and three brothers in New York.
Has my father lost his hair? Has my mother lost weight, gained weight since she received the last
family photographs? Were any of my brothers married?

I show her a few pictures that I brought for her, of my father and his receding hairline, of my
plump mother, and my three brothers, two of whom had became fathers the previous year. With all
the family news out of the way, there is nothing left to do but eat.

It is corn harvest season in the valley surrounding Aunt Ilyana’s house. So over the next three days,
we will eat lots of corn. We grill them over charcoal and firewood sticks in the thatched cooking
shack by the stream. We boil them smothered by banana leaves in an aluminum pot that seemed to
have no bottom. We eat the sweet baby ones raw, right off the cob. From last year’s harvest, we have
cornmeal paste, mayi moulen, for breakfast and a sweet corn flour puree, /abouyi, for supper.

Things fall into a pattern quickly that afternoon as Uncle Joseph and Cousin Nick, who are
staying at the school headmistress’ house nearby, spend their time visiting with parents and meeting
teachers and I attach myself to Aunt Ilyana.

That night over a bowl of J/abowy:, Uncle Joseph tries to convince Aunt Ilyana to move to
Port-au-Prince to be closer to him and his family.

“You're an old woman,” he says. “Not that I’m wishing it, but if something happens to you, you
will not be able to see a proper doctor. People die from simple illnesses here. When Marie Jeanne
died, we were barely able to arrive in time for the funeral. If you die, not that I’m wishing it, it takes
so long to get here that we may not be able to see you one last time. There is no chance that your
brothers in New York, Nounoune, and the others will have time to come and say good-bye. You
know yourself that a corpse can only last a day or two here.”

Having survived both throat and prostate cancer, Uncle Joseph is never afraid to talk about death.
Mortality, for him, is always a looming fact.

“I myself have only a few years left,” Uncle Joseph says. “I am just doing the best I can with them.”

Uncle Joseph’s monologue is interrupted by two shots of gunfire from somewhere in the distance.
Aunt Ilyana explains that it is the village chief, the only legal authority in the surrounding area,
signaling that he is back home from a day trip, in case anyone needs to come see him. If he didn’t
fire his gun once each time he left and twice when he came back, then he would have to send
someone door to door, to let people know when he was there.

“Do you think life is easier for an old woman in the city?” Aunt Ilyana continues. “Here I can

watch over the land and over Marie Jeanne’s grave and even if you don’t see me soon after I die, we
will see one another after.”
