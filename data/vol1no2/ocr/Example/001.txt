in dominica, from the seventeenth century to the nineteenth century, captured runaway slaves
were beheaded and hung from trees to serve as an example for other slaves.

The slaver thought I was finished
when he killed me, but he did not know
that where blood stops, spirit begins.

He did not know that in death I found freedom,
that when I closed my eyes in this world,

I awakened in a place with no time

and saw everything clearer than before.

Like the machete he used:
how its silver shined like

sun on a sharkâ€™s back,

its quiet whoosh of sound

as the slaver swung and sliced
first the wind, then my neck.

That fast, I was dead,

and just as fast, I saw my head jump, then fall,
roll along the dust and stop.

I watched ants crawl into my nostrils,

lose themselves in the tangles of my hair.

Even dismembered,

my body rebellious.

The slaver needed three men to help him

tighten the rope around the bloody stump

that had been my neck. Even then, when they hoisted
me from the large fern, my corpse slipped from the noose
and fell on one of the spectators.
