Calabash

To prevent more escapes, they hung me with two ropes

under my arms and pinned my chest to the tree with bayonets.
They placed a sign at the foot of the tree and

wrote the letters with my blood: La Lecon.

The slavers forced the blacks to look at me and learn carefully.
And they did. More revolted, more ran.

When the only difference between death and life

is a white man’s will,

there is neither death nor life.

My people looked at me and ran faster.

Some escaped, some took my place among the trees,
but we all widened freedom’s birth canal,

our blood moistened the soil for its harvest.

The slaver did not know the power

of our blood and faith and spirit.

He wanted me, through death, to teach my people

a lesson about freedom.
And I did. I did.
