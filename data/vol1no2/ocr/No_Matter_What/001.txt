No Matter What

HE BIRTHMARK RAN FROM HALFWAY MY LEFT EYELID UP TO THE EYEBROW.

It was jet black and had some bristles on it. I had given it a name: “Bomba-wowo’, which in
our native language is more or less a combination of wasp and eye. I don’t remember why or when
the name started, but the birthmark must have been very important to merit a name of its own earlier
