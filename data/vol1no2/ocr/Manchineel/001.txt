Manchineel

“The little green apples that fall from the large branches of the manchineel tree may look tempting,
but they are potsonous to eat and toxic to the touch. Even taking shelter under the tree when it rains
can give you blisters.” — FROM FODOR'S CARIBBEAN TRAVEL GUIDE

I was so confident he lied
when he said he loved me,

I expected his teeth to crack
from the blasphemy,

his tongue to split and slither
like a serpent’s.

But he was everything I thought I needed:
black, tall, strong.

So I ignored the thunderclouds in his eyes,
the lightning in his smile,

and ran to the hurricane

waiting in his arms.

I ignored my broken spirit,

the blisters on my heart that multiplied like maggots
whenever I touched him.

He was everything I thought I needed:

black, tall, strong.

So I ignored the paradox of his cruelty,

a poison that left me crying in

an empty burning desert.
