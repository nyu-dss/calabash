The Maker of Mango Marmalade

She reads the swirls left by the spatula as she turns
the thickening, sweet-scented concoction. Or bubbles

rising up and popping on the surface. The storm of '26
that drowned the great American poet, though his

jumping off the boat was called a suicide. Or the night
sugar cane fields caught fire, blazed the night into

surrender, ashes trickling down from the heavens like
the lace mantillas women wear to church on Sundays.

Or the story of the hag-witch who haunts all bridges
in and out of town. After midnight any man riding

would see this old woman turn into a voluptuous
maiden in stress by the banks of the river. Many men

have drowned chasing after her, others claim they died
chasing their dreams, their own moon-lit shadows,

translucent on the waterâ€™s surface. As she stirs, her hands
cramp like claws the syrupy marmalade forms ribbons,

gauzy, silken on the surface of the pot she reads on.
She tastes for tartness, has learned to drown in such sweetness.
