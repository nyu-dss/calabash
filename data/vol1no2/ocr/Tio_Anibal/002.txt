Calabash

Of women. My uncle would disappear for days,
And then just like magic there he’d be in the kitchen,
Dunking toasted bread into his coffee, smiling,

His hat on his knee, his dusty, cracked boots.

This was Cuba in 1969. Thirty years later, my mother
Calls me in Tallahassee to say that Tio Anibal

Has died of cancer, some kind of skin cancer

That ate him up in little pieces, his fingers, his nose

A deliberate act of disappearance, e/ desaparecimiento,
And I can believe how when the time comes we too

Disappear, we all do, the best magic trick from which

There’s no return, only the awed look of a mute audience.
