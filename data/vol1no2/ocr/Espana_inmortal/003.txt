Homar to design a poster for its Exposicién Colén in commemoration of the explorer’s arrival in
1508. The Casa del Libro, situated in an eighteenth-century townhouse in the Calle del Cristo in
Old San Juan, continues to house an important collection of European manuscripts and incunabula,
particularly those from Spain. Homar's early connection to the museum is significant not only
because it established his lasting ties to the institution, but also because it was at this point that
Homar began visiting the Casa del Libro regularly in order to study its collection and the
typography of Spanish incunabula.0 Homar’s poster for the Casa del Libro’s 1964 exhibition E/
Le6n en los Libros depicts a stylized heraldic lion holding a lavishly bound volume. The lion rampant
is an immediate and powerful icon of the history of the Spanish monarchy and is based on the
royal arms of Castile and Leon. Other exhibitions for which Lorenzo Homar designed silkscreen
posters include Colon y el Libro (1958), El libro Espafiol en el siglo quince (1960), and Los Incunables
Espanoles (1969). The subtitle in Homar’s poster of the latter informs the viewer that the exhibition
was intended to commemorate the five-hundredth anniversary of the wedding of Ferdinand and
Isabella of Spain. At the time the Casa del Libro opened, work was underway on the Museo de
Arte de Ponce. The new museum, built by Luis A Ferré to house the collection he had amassed with
the help of Julius Held, was officially opened to the public in 1959. Ferré commissioned two
designs from Lorenzo Homar for silkscreen promotional posters. Homar chose to model his designs
on two Spanish paintings from the collection. The first represents an homage to sixteenth-century
master Alonso Sanchez Coello, whose portrait of a Lady with a Pink is a jewel of the collection in
Ponce. The pendant poster is based on the Portrait of Cardinal Gaspar de Borja, which was attributed
at the time to Diego Velazquez. In both images, the artist has achieved masterful painterly effects
through transparencies and modeling, while at the same time maintaining the economy of color
necessary to the silkscreen medium. It is no accident of chance that the artist decided to employ
Spanish models for the silkscreen posters that would emerge nationwide as the museum’s public
image. In his account of the founding of the Museo de Ponce, Professor Julius Held has noted that
“the slight bias in favor of Spanish art is understandable in a country where Spanish is the official
language and the cultural links with Spain have been strong and enduring.”!! It should be
remembered that both the Ponce Museum and the Casa del Libro emerged during a historic period
that was marked by the ICP’s official program of seeking, defining, and preserving a national
cultural identity. In turn, Lorenzo Homar’s poster designs situated the two institutions along
particularly Hispanic cultural lines. In 1959, Homar had his first opportunity to work with the
subject of José Campeche (1751-1809), the leading painter and portraitist to Puerto Rico’s criollo
aristocracy. Homar's poster for the exhibition “Pinturas de José Campeche y su Taller”, which was
held at the ICP from October through November of that year, featured an adaptation of the
painter's self-portrait.'2 The historical figure of José Campeche was to provide inspiration
throughout Homar’s career. Thus, when in 1959 Homar was set with the task of designing a poster
