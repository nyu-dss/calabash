LORENZO HOMAR'S PRINTS

FOR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS IN PUERTO RICO

RINTMAKING EMERGED AS PUERTO RICO’S MOST SIGNIFICANT ART FORM
P around the middle of the twentieth century. Silkscreen was the method of choice principally
because it was cost effective and required no presses. Although Irene Delano had introduced the
technique to the island as early as 1946, it was Lorenzo Homar, a virtuoso of the medium and a
devoted teacher, who raised the standards of the medium to unprecedented levels. A significant body
Homar’s work draws on Spanish themes and iconography in order to visually express the shared
cultural heritage of Puerto Rico and Spain. This characteristic of Lorenzo Homatr’s oeuvre may be
explained in part as a reaction to the growing threat of American cultural imperialism, but the
imagery of his prints also conveys a significant aspect of Puerto Rican national identity that predates
the arrival of the United States in 1898.

The decade of the 1950s in Puerto Rico was a time of sweeping social revolution. Of the many
newly formed government agencies and organizations, perhaps the most controversial was the
Instituto de Cultura Puertorriquefia (ICP). As described by its founding director, Ricardo Alegria, the
mandate of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture was to dedicate its energies towards the study,
preservation, enrichment and dissemination of the island’s cultural heritage. From the beginning, the
Institute was officially dedicated to a definition of Puerto Rican culture that was derived from the
indigenous Taino and Arawak peoples, African civilizations imported in the slave trade, and, in
Alegria’s words, “above all, Spain eternal.”! Ultimately the ICP—and its subsidiary organizations—
emerged as the leading force of hispanicism in the island. The ICP’s inclination toward hispanicism,
which may be defined as its commitment to the primacy of the Spanish origins of Puerto Rican
culture and society, stemmed from ideas that had begun to take hold in the earlier part of the century.
It has been proposed that the ultimate motivation for hispanophilia among writers, politicians and
educators during the first half of the twentieth century was likely a direct response to the threat of
imminent cultural invasion on the part of the United States.2 It becomes increasingly clear, however,
that the roots of Puerto Rican hispanicism lie not merely in the reactionary thought of the early
twentieth century. The brand of cultural nationalism propounded by the ICP, for instance, reaches
