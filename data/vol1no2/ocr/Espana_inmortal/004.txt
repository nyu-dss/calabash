to celebrate the bicentenary of the birth of Puerto Rico’s first native-born Bishop, Doctor Don Juan
Alejo de Arizmendi de la Torre, the printmaker chose to employ Campeche’s 1803 portrait of the
prelate as his model for the poster. The resulting poster is a tour-de-force of silkscreen technique
and a masterpiece of the medium. Bishop Juan Alejo distinguished himself both as an active patron
of the arts and as a philanthropist who worked tirelessly for the benefit of the poor. At the top left
of the silkscreen portrait, balancing the depiction of the wicker basket, is an escutcheon bearing
the arms of the episcopate: the lions and tower of Castile and Leon underneath a cardinal’s hat.
The placement of the episcopal emblem mirrors a Spanish artistic practice found in portraits such
as Luis Tristan’s Cardinal Sandoval y Rojas of 1619, which is in the Cathedral of Toledo. The figure
of Bishop Alejo de Arizmendi represents, according to Edgardo Rodriguez Julia, “the first criollo
elite,” and a “germinal manifestation of criollo politics.”13 In other words, he might be seen as a
cultural bridge between Spain and Puerto Rico. In 1970, the fourth major exhibition since 1948
of Campeche’s paintings was being mounted by the ICP; Homar was again commissioned to
design the promotional poster for the show. Homar's silkscreen is an imaginary depiction of the
interior of Campeche’s studio, complete with canvases by the master. Two of the paintings may be
identified as Campeche’s portraits of Maria de los Dolores Martinez de Carvajal and José Mas
Ferrer.!4 The third and largest of the paintings in Homar’s poster is an adaptation of Campeche’s
half-length self-portrait, at present known only through a copy by Francisco Oller. In its
composition, Homar’s poster makes reference to—and pays homage to—the great European
masters Vermeer and Velazquez. According to Rodriguez Castro, commemorative events in Puerto
Rico, such as the anniversary of Bishop Alejo’s birth and the exhibitions of Campeche’s paintings,
were designed by the government (through organizations like the ICP) to create a sense of shared
hispanidad among the island’s citizens.!5 Homar’s posters undeniably reflect part of the ICP’s tacit
political mandate, which was to protect the island from the invasion of Anglo-American culture,
language and religion by emphasizing the history of Puerto Rico’s Hispanic origins. However,
Homar does not make visual reference to the United States or its cultural imperialism through his
work. Through his numerous commemorative posters, his ICP logo designs, and his posters
honoring criollo society and its painter, José Campeche, Homar has promoted a view of the colonial
history of the island characterized by benevolence, refinement and pride. During the colonial era,
it cannot be denied that Puerto Rico’s population was forced to face evangelization, enslavement
and extinction at the hands of the Spanish. In Homar’s imagery, however, the Spaniard is freed from
the associations of Empire and Inquisition that came to define the so-called “Black Legend.”
Furthermore, the body of work that Homar created for the ICP—and other cultural institutions
such as the Museo de Arte de Ponce and the Casa del Libro—sought to embrace the significance
of Puerto Rico’s Spanish heritage. Indeed, although Homar emphasizes the importance of the

island’s links to Spain, his work does not reflect a right-wing call for what José Luis Gonzalez has
