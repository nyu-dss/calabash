back at least as far as the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In her important recent study of
Puerto Rican literature and thought, Malena Rodriguez Castro has convincingly proposed that
Puerto Rican “cultural nationalism, which arose in the first decades of this century, postulates a main
root—hispanicism—which branches into a secondary root—criollismo.”3 Hispanicism, according to
Rodriguez Castro, is characterized furthermore by a conviction of a “fundamental unity of
character” that helps to define and distinguish the Spanish and their descendants,4 The Institute of
Puerto Rican Culture, through figures like Ricardo Alegria and the artist Lorenzo Homar, sought to
affirm rather than deny the island’s Spanish and criollo heritage, which was after all, a feature that
distinguished Puerto Rico’s cultural identity. Essential to such a philosophy is a romanticized—
hispanophile—notion of Spain as an exemplum of civilization freed from the shadow of the Black
Legend of inquisition and bloody conquest. The events of 1898, during which Spain’s imperial
pretensions were finally extinguished, provided an absolution of sorts that made this dramatic
transformation of the image of Spain possible.> Such a concept is clearly reflected in the designs for
the official seal of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, executed in 1955 and 1962 by the island’s
leading graphic artist, Lorenzo Homar. The emblems were modeled on commemorative medals that
were produced in Puerto Rico during the early twentieth century, such as the Juan Ponce de Leon
medal of 1908. Homar’s prints cast a personification of Spain in the central role not as conquistador
but rather a benevolent man of letters. It was an enlightened hispanicism, therefore, on which the
philosophy of the founders of the ICP was based. In forming the board of directors of the ICP
Governor Mufioz Marin selected leading representatives from different intellectual and artistic fields.¢
The highly educated group of men was informed either directly or indirectly by the writings of José
de Diego, president of the Ateneo Puertorriquefio and zealous defender of the integrity of the
Castilian language, Luis Llorens Torres, founder of the satirical Juan Bobo periodical, and Antonio
Pedreira, whose book Insularismo was published in 1934,7 Such authors were characterized by
varying degrees of hispanophilia, with De Diego espousing a particularly fervent version through
his writings. The presence of such an enlightened hispanicism, though ignored in previous scholarly
literature regarding the artist, also defines the fundamental thrust behind an important aspect of
Lorenzo Homat's graphic oeuvre, In 1957, Homar accepted Ricardo Alegria’s invitation to direct the
new Graphics Workshop at the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriquefia. Homar's tenure in the position,
which lasted until 1972, coincided almost exactly with that of Alegria.

During his first year as director of the ICP’s Graphics Workshop, Homar began designing a
poster honoring the 450th anniversary of the Catholic evangelization of Puerto Rico. The
commemorative year celebrated Juan Ponce de Leon’s arrival in San Juan and the subsequent
missionizing of the island’s native population by Spanish clergy. It was also in 1958 that the artist
had his first professional contact with the Casa del Libro. The museum, which had been founded
two years earlier under the aegis of the ICP by a group of independent trustees, commissioned
