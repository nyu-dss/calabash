Sycorax: Requiem

Years have disappeared between his hands
Echoes glide along the lime-pale walls
Her tattoo in his inner ear that is the music

He listens for each morning tuning carefully

To salvage memory grief quarries the days the hours
The dark rises into oh but once there was such music
Twilight dreams shed their smoky skin against

The palm-green mountain side still years like the ghosts

Of forgotten wrecks drift in the masterâ€™s voice leaves music

In its wake the sea tolling grants him no reprieve
Calling from her sandy grave where is my son calling can you hear me

Calling where are those days those years that music?
