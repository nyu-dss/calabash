Silk Cotton Tree

Some say
They hold secrets of centuries
Within their gnarled trunks

They are the silent see-ers

Of ancestors, backs bent

In blazing sun

Seeding earth to birth young trees
The backbone of a nation.

And when, in the noonday heat
Some girl, shunning the overseet’s
Pulsing whip would hide

In foliage at their feet

Their branches bent

To mark the place where she,

Holding within her breast the memory
Of one who gave himself to shield her
From the hurt of that same whip,

Fell to the whim of the master’s will

She gave birth to one stillborn
And buried it there in the dark earth
Between the roots.

And the ghosts of all those loves
Whose hearts were given, taken, broken
In that place

Sigh the wind’s silken breath

Through the leaves of this stand

Of silk cotton trees.
