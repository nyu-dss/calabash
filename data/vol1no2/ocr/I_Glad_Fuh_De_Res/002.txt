148 / Deanne Kennedy

Calabash

CHORUS

An’ some people did get plenty fun
Wen dey se all de clothes we put on,
We straw hats and we skirts

An’ we big long sleeve shirts,

But nuh man din gine kill we wid sun.

All de stockings an’ socks dat yuh see,

An de old pumps dat we had pun we feet -
Dem protec’ we at work,

From de tings in de dirt,

Especially dem santapede.

CHORUS

Now I look out my window an’ see,
An’ hear de news on TV,

Dat tings rearrange,

An’ yuh gettin’ more change,

But dat’s quite alright wid me.

Wuh dem mekkin’ dese days in uh week,
Cuddah buy me uh house, land and sheep;
An’ some travellin’ by truck

But I din have such luck -

I had tuh depend on my feet.

CHORUS

I wun tell yuh uh lie — it did hard,
Wen yuh reach inside dat factory yard,
Yuh did tired fuh spite,

But yuh cun stop till night,

An’ de sweat drippin’ off like hot lard.

But looka how we advance,

An’ betterin’ we circumstance,

We got reapin’ machines

Dat does work like uh dream,
Nowadays - I wun stand uh chance.
