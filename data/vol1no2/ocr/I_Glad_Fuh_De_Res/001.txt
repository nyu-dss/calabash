OS
I Glad Fuh De Res’

Uh now gettin’ pension at las’,

Never thought it would come ‘round suh fas’;

‘Cause I start out from small -
Din have no choice at all,
And my education by-pas’.

I did movin’ by dawn every day,

I din know ‘bout no other way -

That is jus’ how tings stop,

Yuh work till yuh drop,

And yuh hold out yuh han’ fuh yuh pay.

CHORUS

But I glad fuh de res,
I real glad,

T really cabn say

Dat I sad;

Is fub dem dat I toil,
An I work wid de soil,
So I real glad fuh dem,
I real glad.

I cook up whatever I find,

An’ if it din much, I din mind,
‘Cause boy, yuh cud bet,

I cud mek dat food stretch,

An’ even have some lef’ behind.

An’ I tell yuh, I in mekkin’ nuh sport -
Cane loadin’ it nuh easy work;

De men does be cuttin’,

1 in say dat in nuthin’,

But we had was tuh carry de load.
