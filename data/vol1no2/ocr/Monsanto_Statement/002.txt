HE PAINTING WORKS AS A METAPHOR FOR THE UNBALANCED RELATIONSHIP

between the power-centers of the first world and the often marginalized third world nations
of the Caribbean. The flying pigs, aggressively sucking the juices and energy from the fruit tree
before the iguanas have a chance to nourish from the plants, symbolize the continuous domination
of the western [art] centers over the visual representations of the inhabitants of the Caribbean. The
painting is entitled “La combate de cohones y iguana” and the iguanas appear in ancient dinosaur-
like visualization to accentuate the physical endurance and the continuity of the struggle against
colonization and neo-imperialism.

The painting was part of the series “La decadencia europa” which was inspired by what I was
seeing around me in Europe where I was living in 1994. In the Netherlands the exaggerated
tolerance of sex, drugs and euthanasia is propagated as positive, while at the same time there exists
a deeply rooted fear of marginalized colored people. This paradox of psychological dynamics in
European society in leading to a decay of social structures and, at the same time, towards the re-
emergence of a repressive set of rules that indicate the desire for a clean, conservative and
immigrant-free society.

The series was first shown in the one-man show, “Suefios de un Pintor Biajante” in the Museo de
Arte Moderno, Santo Domingo in June 1994. Since then my work has evolved toward installations that
usually include large paintings. These paintings continue my interest in the multiracial ancestry of the

Caribbean and the intersection of Catholic rites on the African religions and realities of the region.
