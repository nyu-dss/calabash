50 / June Spalding

Calabash

while Major eyes their pale, suspicious legs
tripping from stove to sink

between a promise and daybreak,

his head resting on well-fed forepaws that
Massa strokes in the prim shadows.

But Massa ignores the love Missis begs for
in the bated despair of her night,

when his determined boots crunch the dirt
outside my door,

and I wield my machete in silence

at cane leaves and the bleached head
hovering above my corn-husk pillow

that offers dreams livelier than he finds
between his own white sheets.

My own sister's hands model corals
in the warm Caribbean sea.

And the lonely island,

adrift from its mother continent,
stares at my torn, worm-eaten hands
that grip the cold earth,

buttressed by a charged body, bent,
but buoyed by tomorrow,

bowed on land

as on that fearful passage

of shackled tongues

and conspiring tides

that hide my sister's name

from the whip,

while fearless maroons

resist white bayonets and bullets,
and I, fierce and proud,

child of a free people,

will rise like doubloons

recovered from the seabed.
