Koromantyn Girl

The one overboard is my sister.

I hold her grave inside me,

a memorial without words, a fire
scurrying along my shackled legs,
rushing to scorch out a spot

on the sweet shores of paradise.

This is the land of wood and water,
swimming with bodies

oiled and revived for

hands that will fondle their future
like pirated pieces of eight,

a buccaneer's contraband

brought ashore at Port Royal,
fertile port for successive shipments
of sea-scarred bodies and eyes

like mine, that cast a backward glance
through time and memory.

And all the while

I fetch the wood and water

for somebody else, not for me,

for I am a slave,

weatherproofed by my blackness,
working to increase the fields of sweet
brown sugar that spring from the blood
of fingers splayed in sun-struck fields.

The black molasses on Massa's table
sweetens his imperial palate,

but not his tongue that could halt

my cane-carved callouses.

My two yellow children

caress Massa's food in the big kitchen,
