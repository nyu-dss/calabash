Calabash

(or let us say it like this)

i&

i&i&

iii

in eternal seeding time

traverse the frontiers of memory and matter

in perennial quest of harvest

weave a hemisphere of holes

under the overcast of manifest destiny

para sembrar luces de libertad in the backroads

to fire the catacombs of poverty stifling still with our multitude
from colon to cortez

from pizarro to puritans

from founding fathers to feeding empire

from the middle passage helled up hull of “Desire” to Hollywood
we have been contesting since lost motherland

the approaches to motherlode sinews of war

blood mead for the wealth of nations

we are a rake of fingers seeding what is budding over adolescent
the renewing image of i&i

coming ever closer

to understand this thing about rightful claim is to engage the contest
POWER

“... concedes nothing without demand .. .”

LOVE

constructs all things by sweat&sacrifice&study & science

holy democracy is ascendant

by the rejoicing of every orifice

that stakes the claims for which we have been manure and claim the stakes
engage the contest . . .

power to do right or perish.
