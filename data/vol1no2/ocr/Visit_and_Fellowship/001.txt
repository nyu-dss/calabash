DE
Visit & Fellowship

I am here

in Miami, Fidel

closer to you

& it is the paleness again, o beloved mountain dreamer
that hates so

(for loss of privilege to scorn and scorch the salt of the earth)
which, my mother says, i should be careful not to mention
“if the police stops you, har,

because they like to beat people in their head

down

there”

I am over here

in Miami, Aristide

looking for you

& it is the indigo again, o little shepherd healer
that is spaded so

stained

through bone and cartilage

where, my sister says, i should be careful
“because you know how you are, Lasana

and you just can’t go telling people what you like in their place”
(not that she wouldn’t do it herself anyhow)

I am initiated all over

for the Haiti of my circumcision
I am bleeding again

for the Cuba of my first period
Iam rejoicing still

for the reign of change is legion
