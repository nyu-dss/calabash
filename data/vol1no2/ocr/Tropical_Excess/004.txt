Lezama and the journal Origenes, Portocarrero seems to have been essentially a self-taught artist. His
first exhibitions date from the early to mid 1930s. Like the writings of the Origenes group,
Portocarrero’s art has been construed as staking out a national identity through a pictorial language
rooted in local cultural forms. Unlike Pelaez, Portocarrero covered a broad and varied range of
themes: urban views, domestic interiors, images of the circus and carnival, and religious subjects,
especially angels and popular saints. If Pelaez fixated on Cubism, Portocarrero drew from diverse
sources. At times his work echoes Matisse, with whom he shared a preference for luminous color, a
decorative line, and a taste for depicting the spaces of femininity; at other moments the influence of
Wilftedo Lam, Paul Klee, or the Mexican muralists prevailed. What distinguishes Portocarrero’s art
is a quasi-expressionistic brushwork and the corruscating textural quality of his canvases.

In his own way Portocartero is as stylized an artist as Pelaez, manifesting an equally keen eye for
translating the quotidian into a rarefied world of profuse ornamentation. But if Pelaez offset her
decorative bent with a rigorous feeling for structure, Portocarrero eschewed reality for an evocative
world fashioned by memory and a kind of inner vision. In Portocarrero’s painting entire surfaces
radiate with the sensuality of the tropics in an intricate and luxuriant impasto that renders the
presence of the human figure, as in Pelaez almost invariably female, nearly indistinguishable from
its luxuriant surroundings (Lezama describes them as “prolongations of the house’).

Art historian Narciso Menocal notes how the highly saturated surfaces of Portocarrero’s canvases
evoke the visual memory of interiors bathed in the patterns of colored light diffused through the
stained glass panels of the medrto punto. The latter is an architectural device consistent of geometrical
patterns of large pieces of colored glass inserted into the semicircular area of an arched doorway.
Lezama interpreted these lushly colored surfaces as visionary reminiscences of a childhood spent in
the protective warmth of the colonial house.

Lezama and Carpentier also identified Portocarrero’s baroque fusion of color, light, and gestural
brushwork as a statement of Cuban cultural identity. Yet if these early paintings’ metonymical
references to colonial architecture once again posit a creole bourgeois identity, Portocarrero’s work
of the 1960s, the Carnival series, the series of Popular Saints, and perhaps most paradigmatically
the Color of Cuba series, appeared to turn away from European high art and bourgeois culture
towards popular and folkloric art forms, particularly the religious practices and imagery of Cuba’s
African population. Carpentier could now describe Portocarrero’s painting as a unique celebration of
the baroque spirit that traversed and informed Cuban popular culture: its dances, its music, its food,
its very attitude towards life.

Under Castro's regime Portocarrero’s painting took on an emblematic role in a revolutionary
society that had catapulted to the fore subaltern expressions previously excluded, with the exception
of Wilfredo Lam, from modern art discourses. As renowned Cuban critic Gerardo Mosquera has

pointed out, Portocarrero’s midcareer submersion into the Afro-Cuban experience signaled the
