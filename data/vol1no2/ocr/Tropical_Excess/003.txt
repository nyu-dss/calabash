the innovations of the European avant-garde. Having trained in her native Cuba under the tutelage
of late Impressionist painter Leopoldo Romafiach, Pelaez came into first-hand contact with
European modernism over the course of a seven-year sojourn in Paris, from 1927 to 1934. She
especially gravitated towards Cubism, particularly the work of Picasso and Juan Gris, although
Alexandra Exter, a Russian painter and set designer interested in Constructivsm and Futurism,
appears to have been an equally important influence through her classes at the Academie Moderne.
Upon her return to Cuba, Pelaez quickly developed her personal style, coming into her own as an
artist in the 1940s.

Pelaez absorbed from Cubism the convention of laying out a geometric structure and the
rendering of objects and spaces from multiple points of view. Her pictures displayed fruits or fish
seen from above, sideways, and below, resting on plates or tables tilted forward. Yet this simplified
geometric structure vied with a penchant for increasingly complex arabesque lines, overwrought
compositions, and bright colors.

Pelaez’s decorative urge and vocabulary of formal motifs have been linked to the design and
ornamentation of colonial Cuban architecture. After her return from Paris, Pelaez spent the
remainder of her life living with her mother and sisters in a turn-of-the century colonial house in
the residential neighborhood of La Vibora on the outskirts of Havana. Like other upper-class
districts of Havana built immediately before or after Cuba’s independence, La Vibora contained
exquisite homes designed in the eclectic classicism of the Beaux Arts tradition or the sinuous, organic
shapes of Art Nouveau. Thus the frequent curvilinear shapes in her paintings seemingly recall the
grilled ironwork of balconies and windows, while the bright colors enclosed by thick black contours
are reminiscent of the stained glass windows and fanlights that filtered the heat and harsh Caribbean
light. These formal references, as well as the tropical subject matter and its baroque, decorative
rendering, have been read as signs of Cubanness.

Pelaez rarely depicted the human figure; like her French counterparts, she evinced a preference
for still life over portraiture or landscape painting. Nevertheless, there is an indelible presence of the
feminine, not only in the evocation of domestic space, especially kitchens and gardens, but also in
the tacit sexual connotations of the undulating tropical fruits, flowers, and birds. In addition to these
signs of gender, Pelaez’s paintings exhibit as well markers of class. The colonial spaces evoked in
these works were the habitat of the creole bourgeoisie, the wellspring of Cuba’s independence
movement and fulcrum of its intellectual and artistic renaissance. Thus this highly decorative and
self-contained pictorial style figured a specific Cuban identity, namely that of the primarily white,
upper and middle classes who, up and until Castro’s insurgency, had controlled Cuba's destiny and
defined its cultural self-image.

The other Cuban painter that Lezama and Carpentier located within the realm of the baroque is
René Portocarrero (1912-1985). A member of the circle of poets and writers assembled around
