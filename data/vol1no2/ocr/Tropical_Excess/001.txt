CARIBBEAN ART & THE BAROQUE

UCH THEORETICAL AND CRITICAL WRITING ON CARIBBEAN AND LATIN

American culture has been devoted to the controversial equation of its artistic practices with
the fantastic or magical realism. By comparison, Anglo-American scholarship has barely discussed
Caribbean and Latin American art in relation to the concept of the baroque. This is especially
regrettable considering the centrality of this notion within Caribbean, and particularly Cuban art
criticism.

My presentation today will revisit the concept of the baroque as it has been theorized by
prominent Cuban writers such as Alejo Carpentier, José Lezama Lima, and Severo Sarduy in
connection to twentieth century Caribbean art. To these authors the term baroque designates not
only the art produced during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but rather it defines an
ahistorical and continuous aesthetic impulse towards polyphony, heterogeneity, dialogism, textual
density, and decorative excess. In their writings the stylistic traits of the baroque become a means to
assert and elaborate a Latin American, and more specifically a Caribbean identity.

Alejo Carpentier was among the most vocal proponents of reading Latin American culture
through the prism of the baroque. He envisioned the baroque as a constant of Latin American
identity that could be traced to its remotest past. In the eyes of Carpentier, Pre-Columbian
architecture, sculpture, and manuscript painting already exhibit a preference for baroque surfaces
replete with curves and profuse ornamentation. How could it be otherwise, he argues, given the
exuberance and overwhelming sensuality of the tropics. According to this view, the Americas, rather
than Europe, should be regarded as the privileged site of the baroque.

Under Iberian colonial rule the inhabitants of Latin America participated in an unprecedented
process of racial, religious, and cultural fusion or mestizaje. And indeed, during much of this period
the arts attained an unusual vigor and inventiveness, coinciding with the stylistic movement known
in Europe as the Baroque. Although this style was imported from Europe, novelist and essayist José
Lezama Lima reclaimed the baroque as cosa nuestra, the property of the peoples of the Americas, and
the quintessential American mode of expression, to borrow the title of his famous essay.

Instead of regarding the Latin American baroque art as a style imposed upon the oppressed
