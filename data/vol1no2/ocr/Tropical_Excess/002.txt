indigenous peoples by the Spanish colonizers, Lezama envisioned it as a synthetic art, born out of
the merging of the European and the authoctonous, wherein the latter had the upper hand. This
process of mestizaje rendered itself visible in the ornate stone facades and richly decorated interiors
of cathedrals, convents, hospitals, and palaces.

Instead of partaking of the reactionary or obscurantist tendencies of its European paragon, the
Latin American baroque embodied for Lezama a liberatory investment and transformation of the
dominant culture with the irrepressible force of an indigenous pantheistic vision. In the process, the
Latin American baroque artist enacted a counterconquest, an underhand operation capable of
overriding and vanquishing the rationality of European culture with its sheer formal excess and the
luxurious, sensual appeal of materials that celebrated the continent’s abundant natural resources.

Lezama saw this playfully subversive syncretism best reflected in the work of the seventeenth-
century mason and craftsman Kondori, a Peruvian Indian, and in the churches of eighteenth-century
Brazilian architect and sculptor Aleijandinho. Kondori surreptitiously introduced Indian faces, native
flora and fauna, and Inca symbols among the lush foliage, classical columns, and mythological
creatures crowding the facades of his buildings. In Kondori’s art classical European forms and local
Inca iconography meet on equal grounds. Aleijandinho, a mulatto, performed a similar leveling of
foreign and local artistic idioms, but this time impregnating Western forms with African influences.
In Lezama’s view these two native undercurrents, the Africanist and the Indian, constitute the main
tributaries of Latin America’s flamboyant baroque.

Within the syncretism intrinsic to the Latin American baroque, by means of which Western styles
evolved into something genuinely American, Lezama discerned the genesis of a Latin American
identity that would blossom into the independence movements of the early 1800s. The artistic
mestizaje practiced by the likes of Kondori and Aleijandinho heralded the syncretic practices of
twentieth-century avant-garde artists all over Latin America, constituting a precedent for the
hybridity that authors such as Nestor Garcia Canclini and Gerardo Mosquera have ascribed to the
contemporary artistic practices of postmodernism.

Looking at the art of their contemporaries, Carpentier and Lezama saw no solution of continuity
between the formal intricacy and excess of the Latin American baroque and the paintings of Amelia
Pelaez and René Portocarrero, leading figures of Cuba’s modernism. Both of these artists achieved
a synthesis of European avant-garde languages and native themes and motifs that was construed at
the time as part of a larger endeavor to forge a national cultural identity. As such, Pelaez and
Portocarrero revised and updated the cultural processes of mestizaje and syncretism that had shaped
and created a post-colonial Latin America. Carpentier and Lezama understood these artists’ recourse
to a baroque visual language in relation to their social and cultural spheres, the physical presence of
nature, and the impact of local artistic traditions.

Amelia Pelaez (1896-1968) is usually regarded as the most important Cuban artist working with
