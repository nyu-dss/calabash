recognition of a Cuban identity no longer solely based on its European component, but proudly
aware of its African roots.

Twenty years earlier Wilfredo Lam had advanced a similar notion of the baroque in canvases like
The Jungle, Mofumba, What Does It Mean, Omi Obini, all three from 1943, or The Idol (1944). Lam’s
barroquismo erupts in horror-vacui compositions of flowing, organic shapes —strange, hybrid
creatures combining human, animal, and vegetal forms, generally regarded as depictions of the
orishas or deities of the Afro-Cuban religion known as santeria— set against shallow backgrounds
of dense over-all tropical foliage and luminous colors.

Pelaez’s cubist geometrical structures attempted to impose order and immobility on the profusion
of organic forms and ornament, attaining a measure of balance between nature and culture that
mirrored the creole’s domestication and sublimation of the tropics into the decorative patterns of the
colonial home. Conversely, Lam’s paintings celebrated nature’s rebellion and ultimate triumph over
the rationality, functionalism, and repression of Western culture. The disruptive sexual energy found
in nature, and contained by Pelaez’s thick black contours and meticulous composition, explodes in
Lam's painting into a promiscuous proliferation of breasts, buttocks, and phallic symbolism.

In its inventive fusion of surrealism, cubism, African tribal art, and santeria imagery, Lam’s painting,
of course, realized the hybridity and syncretism that Lezama and Carpentier posited as the
foundation of Caribbean identity. Although neither of these authors place Lam at the center of their
arguments, from their perspectives his brand of the baroque, by virtue of its exuberant
miscegenation of races, cultures, religions, and artistic languages, would constitute the most
Caribbean expression of all.
