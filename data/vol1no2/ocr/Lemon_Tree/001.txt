Lemon Tree

Lemon tree very pretty
And the lemon flower so sweet

But the fruit of the poor lemon
Is impossible to eat.

— JAMAICAN FOLK SONG

My father’s father lies dying,
tubes in every orifice and vein,
oxygen trying to make him live.
Jigsaw puzzles, unfinished

on the drawing room table,
dimly patterned plush rugs

that swallow my bare feet;

cool, dark wood in contrast

to the bright, bright sun,
outside, in the garden,

where I am sent to play,

where yellow birds sing

but I still hear his rasping;

the lemon tree, its blossoms
white and pink against the blue,
blue sky, when I look up,

twirl, see the whole world
spinning, a kaleidoscope

of colour and smell.
