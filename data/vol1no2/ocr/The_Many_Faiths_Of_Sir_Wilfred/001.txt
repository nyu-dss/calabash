The Many Faiths Of Sir Wilfred Knight

OUNG WILFRED KNIGHT WAS ON HIS WAY TO GOOD FRIDAY SERVICE WHEN

he heard the singing. The sun was burning as it always did on Good Friday in Barbados, and
the glare from it kept his eyes to the ground. But when he came upon the Church of God and heard
the singing he looked up. Wilfred was an Anglican. He was baptized in the faith and confirmed, and
he expected to be married by the same man who had performed these rites, Reverend Small. But the
sun was burning, and he was halfway to St. Christopher’s, his church, and the singing sounded more
exciting than anything he would hear from Reverend Small, who was only five years older than he,
especially for a Good Friday service. So Wilfted Knight, aged 17, of the Parish of Christ Church,
stopped dead in his tracks, walked back to the Church of God, sat in the last pew to pleasant smiles
and welcoming nods, and never turned back.

It wasn’t long after that Wilfred got to know Cherise. Pastor Brown introduced them. Cherise,
like he, was a recent convert, and Pastor Brown thought she might guide him through the myster-

it quite so much. She supposed it was because she loved him. Wilfred had to stop her from getting
carried away. They went home, happy but frustrated, and lay awake thinking of each other that end-
less night.

Within a month, they were married. Wilfred was 18. So was Cherise. Soon, Wilfred passed his
exams for the civil service, and Cherise got pregnant. She stopped working as a head clerk for Cave
Shepherd in Bridgetown and sat home, growing large and content. Wilfred had a good job in gov-
ernment and, in no small measure due to Cherise’s encouragement, was gaining the favourable atten-
tion of his superiors. On the same day he was promoted to a chief officer in the ministry of foreign
affairs, Cherise gave birth to a 5 Ib, 3 oz girl with big brown eyes. They baptized her Ona Cherise
in the Church of God. Within two years, Cherise gave birth to a son. By this time, they had moved
