With his last breath, Sir Wilfred laughed and died with his eyes wide open.

Reverend Small, startled by the outburst, closed them after a moment. Then, after a moment more,
in the disturbing silence that followed, he took his stole from his bag, wrapped it around his neck,
opened his Bible, and began to pray over the body.
