watch and see.

But Wilfred couldn’t. With Cherise’s laissez-faire attitude, what if they didn’t snap out of it? What
if Errol remained indifferent to his maker and Ona went off, completely, into the bush? He had
already lost his wife; he didn’t want to lose his children. To what, he wasn’t sure; he couldn’t say he
feared for their immortal souls... Still, he was frightened for them, the way he was that day their
mother refused to go to the Church of God with him. On his next visit to see the children, Wilfred
sat them down to talk. He told them about the importance of faith and constancy. Pointed out the
flaws in their philosophies. Set himself up as an example of the benefits of a life lived in the Spirit,
according to tradition. He finished by asking them to reconsider, come with him to church this
Sunday, give it another try.

They said nothing at first, simply stared into his face.

He smiled a little; they did, too.

Then they looked at each other, at him again and burst out laughing. They laughed and laughed
and laughed, gasping for air, falling off their seats.

Wilfred quietly got up and left the house.

Cherise, both angry and pitying, looked on without a word.

It was the last time Wilfred had any contact with his family. Seeking to erase the misery of his
defeat, Wilfred accepted an ambassadorship to the United States, For the next 30 years, he worked
hard, alone, known as a man of conviction who could get the job done. He was occasionally pitied;
it appeared he had lost his family to his career — had chosen his career over them. But he was con-
sidered a success and, in his 70th year, was knighted by the Queen of England herself. It was that
year he returned to the new republic. He told his aides he was going to visit, but really he was going
to die. He was old, now, tired.

On the night he felt Death approaching, he called for Reverend Small. Time had been gentle with
the reverend. He was stooped but fit, lucid enough.

The first thing Sir Wilfred asked Reverend Small, his little black preacher's bag still in hand, was
if he remembered him.

“Should 1?” said the reverend, taking Sir Wilfted for confused. “I know of you. I've seen you
speak...”

Sir Wilfred waved away his words. “No, no, that’s not what I mean. Look at me. Do you remem-
ber? I was a member of your congregation, of your church.”

Reverend Small looked at him doubtfully; he hesitated to say another word. Then, slowly, he
started to nod. “Yes. Yes. I think I do. But that was a long time ago. We would’ve been just boys then.
I couldn’t have known you long, I was new to the church.”

“But I wasn't.” Silence.

Reverend Small decided to take a chance. “You live here by yourself?”
