into an old great house in St. James, on the West Coast, and Cherise knew she would never have to
work again in her life. Wilfred was thinking of entering politics. He had a desire to serve others that
seemed unquenchable, unstoppable. Whichever party he ran for, he was expected to win. Cherise and
Wilfred named their son Errol Walton, for Errol Walton Barrow, the nation’s emancipator. Pastor
Brown, who seemed to age ten years for every two, was pleased. Wilfred went on to win his seat in
the next election. In short order, he was the number two man in the party. Whether he would ever
take the reins was questionable; he was decisive yet lacked the personal touch. He was well-respected
by the public but not nearly so well-loved. Some thought he aspired to be a man of ideas in an age
when action was needed most, others took him for a pretender to the throne yet out of his realm.
Either way, Cherise’s prediction was correct. She never worked outside the home (and even then the
children had a nanny, and she, a maid), and the family prospered. Wilfred worked diligently at what-
ever he proposed, and life was sweet. The children were growing straight and strong as Tamarind
rods, and he and Cherise demanded little of each other.

But then one day, a Sunday, as they were dressing for church, Cherise told Wilfred she would not
be going to the Church of God with him. He asked her if she was ill; she said, “No.” He asked her
if he had done something to offend her; again, she said, “No.” It was only as she continued to pre-
pare for church that he grew alarmed.

“Then where are you going?” he demanded. She told him she was done with the Church of God,
and she was returning to her original faith. She told him he was free to join her, but, by the look on
his face, she knew he would not.

Wilfred said he didn’t understand her sudden conversion.

Cherise said there was nothing sudden about it and walked out the door. Wilfred sat at the kitchen
table, dumbfounded. He did not go to church that Sunday, nor for many after that, watching Cherise
go to hers. He would have spoken to someone about his pain and confusion, except Pastor Brown
had passed away ever since, and the new pastor, a much younger man than he, was not the type to
inspire confidence. Nor did he trust any of his political confreres.

Wilfred and Cherise continued to drift apart until they divorced. She agreed to keep the children.
By this time, Ona and Errol were almost adults. They were not surprised when their parents sepa-
rated—they had never been what the children would call close; if anything, Wilfred and Cherise
lived like brother and sister. But they were hurt. Errol stopped going to church—any church—and
declared himself agnostic. (Wilfred doubted the boy, never a bright student, knew the meaning of
the word.) Ona, her thick, black hair as dark and beautiful as her eyes, began to grow dredlocks.
Cherise seemed unconcerned. She said once Errol stopped being angry he would start going to
church again. The boy was raised up in it all his life, wasn’t he? He was yet young. As for Ona, well,

all girls her age flirt. It was part of becoming a woman. Ona was just flirting with Rastafarianism,

and as soon as the attraction waned, she'd be looking elsewhere. Cherise told him to relax, trust her,
