History

is always just ensuing

it is our eternal story

renewed each time we are so forward

as we gaze upon the face of Freedom

and summon her like proud rooster

spur off the locks barring the sight from night
from oozing out the maroonspill light of dawn
bawl out songs of good morning, good morning
ah come fo’ meh country

reaping

a day

in which nothing compares

to Freedom

which so many of us have forgotten to claim

as a matter of right to fight for

and if needs be to erect death

as a monarch to be slain at the altar of guillotine
to born the day of democracy in the nation-birth of republic
and no longer swear that there is no greater reward
than the heaven which awaits those

wie willen holland houden

vie who be more french than the french

luisteren allemaal

listen everybody

escuchan pueblo

tout le monde écouter

soft as the whisper may be
your period is calling you
like a girl come of age.
