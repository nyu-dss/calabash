up and tied a loop in the boat’s rope through which he was just able to push a heavy stone. Now
the boat could not float away. The old man took a quick bath, there on the spot. The water was warm
and he felt wonderful.

He climbed out of the river onto the bank. The wet kamisa stuck to his hips and thighs. He quickly
took the agwalakka in one hand, the chopper and the paddle in the other, and climbed the hill. He
used the paddle to push aside the old hammock that served as his door. He opened his old
agwagidiwaja (metal suitcase) and took out a clean kamisa and a jacket. After he had put on these
clothes, he took from the suitcase a neatly folded loincloth in which he kept the portrait. He unfolded
it and took out the picture. He had neither matches nor kerosene, so he could not light the
tamoendoe. He walked outside to admire the picture in the light of the moon. He couldn’t see
Yayomai's face very well, for the moonlight was not clear enough and his eyes were no longer what
they had been. But he could see a little bit, and what he could not see he imagined.

“One day, when I come to her, I will see her face clearly, in all its detail,” he sighed as he went
back inside. He placed the picture in the kamisa and folded it neatly again. Then he lay down. He
was still holding the kamisa, but when he began to feel sleepy he placed it under his head as a pillow.

Half asleep now, he murmured about the events of the day: “It’s a good thing to believe in your
fathers, it is a very good thing.” He searched for words to express his gratitude, but the words would
not come. “What can I say? God of my river, you have led me safely, thank you for this. Moon,
your wife, your children, thank you for the light. Yes, it is good to believe. Yes, Lindéma, you are
only a man after all.”

Mumbling incoherently, he fell asleep. The light of the moon through the many holes in the hut
lit upon him. His face, with his eyes shut, was that of a saint immersed in deep and endless prayer.

A few hours later the moon paled. The sun’s rays entered the hut and shone across Awanga’s face.
But he just lay there as he was: he did not stir, his eyes were closed and on his face appeared the
trace of a contented smile, at rest.
