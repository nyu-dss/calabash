wanted to evict them so he could come live here himself. No, they weren't about to leave.

But they did leave, once the dam was built. The great chief of the tribe himself was present at
the official ceremony for the closing of the floodgates. The water, which had followed its course
from the mountains to the sea for thousands of years, was suddenly stopped in its tracks. It began
to swell, left its banks and took the first village as its prey. Many others followed. The inhabitants
had to leave; many of them had no idea where they were going.

Awanga’s village was also threatened. They called on him to come back quickly and bring the
divinity to safety. The journey from the Coppename to the Saamakka, as the Saramaccans called their
river, was long. When he reached the village, it had already been flooded. Impoverished and
disappointed, Awanga decided to spend the rest of his life at Afobaka. A fisherman who had pity
on him gave him a hut on top of a hill. From there he had a good view of the reservoir. Every day,
as he looked out from his hilltop to the south, he hoped to return to Lombe someday, to speak with
his fathers.

One morning the old man left his house, a gourd in one hand. The gourd contained a piece of
pembadot (terra alba) and a little bottle of drama (strong drink). A paddle, a chopper and his gwalakka,
an antique rifle he had inherited from his grandfather, were already in the corial. The weapon was
no longer used for shooting, but it had mysterious powers that protected the old man. Awanga put
the gourd in the boat and took his place in the stern. Then he pushed the boat out onto the lake
and began to paddle. The wind helped him, pushing the corial. Before him lay the wide reservoir
with its endless mass of dead trees rising up ghostlike from the water.

He arrived at a part of the lake where there were no trees. The wind blew harder and the boat
went on even faster. Awanga smiled. Now he only had to steer. To get there more quickly he avoided
the river and took the shortcuts. He had to be at his fathers’ before the late afternoon. The village
was no longer there, but the mighty trunk of the Kankan tree would be standing proudly above the
water's surface. The spirits still lived there. Awanga was in a hurry to reach the tree, for it was his
only hope. Yet in fact he was pleased with the speed his corial was making.

“The gods are with me,” he said to himself. “I must be crazy to long for more.” As a sign of
gratitude he broke off a piece of pemba and threw it into the water. Then he sang a song his father
had taught him back in the days when they went to the city by corial. This song for the water gods

was a prayer to keep the waters calm:

Afo Awintia eeh

teki njang-njang ooh

Piki mieh ta abba zé

foe go na Majongo Dawme.
