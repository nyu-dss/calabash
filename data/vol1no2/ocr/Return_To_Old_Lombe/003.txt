This song had always summoned up a powerful longing among the elders. Awanga was
overpowered by a great homesickness for a country far across the sea. His eyes filled with tears.

The wind had died down. The water was as smooth as glass. Awanga was pleased with this too,
even though it meant he had to work more with his paddle. It wouldn't have been good if the wind
had picked up further. The water could become more turbulent, and that would put too much of a
strain on the old man’s powers. He paddled on quietly in the hope and expectation of reaching
Lombe. He stopped for a few minutes to pray at the place where the Wakibasu now lay underwater,
for this was the birthplace of his father.

Every village that now lay at the bottom of the lake, deep below the dark water, caused him grief
as he paddled above them. When he was young it would have taken him one hour to paddle from
Wakibasu to Lombe. Now it took him longer, now that he was no longer young.

Around noon he passed the cove at Gran Lombe, which he recognized from the big Tonka tree.
Gran Lombe was the cove of his youth. Here he had whistled the fish song for the first time. He
remembered how he had whistled and lured the krobias up from the depths. Here he brought his
corial to a halt. He was tired. His eyes closed. When he opened them again he saw the Kankan tree
in the distance.

“Pada, pada!” he called out, egging himself on. His heart pounded faster in excitement with every
dip of the paddle that brought him closer to the tree. It had been years since his old heart had
pounded so hard. At this moment, Awanga lived only in expectation of the meeting with his faithful
old Kankan tree. He rose to his feet. His lame leg didn’t even bother him. No, there was no time to
think about that leg. He went on paddling, standing up. Only fifty meters were between him and
the tree of his life.

Birds familiar from Awanga’s youth that had nested in the Kankan tree were still there, although
there were not as many as in the past. They startled up from their perches for a moment at the old
man’s approach, but then settled back again, as if to welcome him. An iguana that had been clinging
to the tree jumped into the water in fear. But then he too swam back to the tree and hid himself
among the mass of plants clinging to the waterlogged wood.

“Don't be afraid,” said Awanga, who now had reached the tree. “We are partners in adversity, we
are all victims of Lindéma.” For that was the name the Saramaccans had given to the engineer
Lindeman, the man who had supervised the construction of the dam.

The old man trembled in his desire to feel the tree, but he did not touch it yet. He felt guilty for
