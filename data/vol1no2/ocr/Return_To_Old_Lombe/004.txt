his absence during the transmigration. He had not been at his father’s grave to bid him farewell. The
obia hut with its divinities had disappeared beneath the water. Awanga still had to ask permission to
speak with his fathers and the divinities.

Around his upper right arm was an iron ring that he had worn for more than fifty years. He only
took the ring off when it was absolutely necessary. Now the moment had come for Awanga to take
off this magic ring. A deep groove remained in Awanga’s arm where the ring had been. He let the
corial drift a few meters from the Kankan tree, so that he could tie its rope to a branch in preparation
for the ritual to come. He broke off a piece of pembadoti and dissolved it in a mixture of water and
dram that he had poured into the gourd. Then he tied a piece of twine to the ring, which he held
in the gourd so that the power of the contents could be absorbed. Awanga removed the ring and
wound the end of the twine around his index finger. He moved to the middle of the corial and held
the ring just above his knees. The ring hung there, motionless. Even the wind did not move it. Very
quietly, as though only thinking aloud, the words passed Awanga’s lips: “Obia, I have fallen in the
eyes of my father, but I have come in the hope of being forgiven. Is that right: will I be forgiven?”
The ring hung still. This frightened Awanga a bit, but he recovered and calmly asked: “Will my father
and the gods speak to me, obia?” Now the ring swung quietly back and forth. This gave Awanga
hope.

“Kr Will! myyyy father Mataibo, Afo Kwassi M’Kamba, speak to me in the name of Kedjama
Kedjampo? Will they speak to their son, Wangainaito?” The ring swung wildly back and forth.
Awanga was so pleased, he began to hum a song of thanks. Thanks to his father and the gods who
had mercy on him. He was sure of himself, and he was satisfied.

“Di andeloe akki fia fia wan,” he murmured as he watched the ring. “In truth, this ring is genuine,”
he repeated. He wrapped the twine around the ring and put it back on his arm. He untied the corial
and paddled, now unafraid and full of longing, towards the Kankan tree. When he reached the tree
he knelt in the boat for better balance. He spread his arms and hugged the tree passionately. Power
flowed into him. He shook like a little bush in a waterfall. His eyes were ablaze. The Kromanti took

possession of him.

Obla, obla, mi doro, mi doro

Mi doro mi tata mi doro

Pikien m’wana kon takki grn soema odi
baka dati awani go na Ajanikaa,

Greetings, greetings, I am here, I am here
I, child of the forest

I am here, my father, I am here

I want to greet you first and then I wish
to enter the kingdom of the dead.
