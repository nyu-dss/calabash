Sa baba, sa baba pikien m’wana
Moesoetoegado nanga den pikien f’ em
no frigiti joe

Pikien m’wana sa feni libi na Ajanikaa.

Welcome, welcome my child

The gods of the wood and their sons
have not forgotten you

For you there is surely a place

beside your fathers.

The meeting with the divinities lasted all afternoon. Finally the Kromanti left Awanga. A bit
dazed, he lay in the bobbing corial. A cool evening breeze blew across the water. It made the old
Awanga forget that he still had a great many hours of paddling ahead of him. Sleep took him for
an hour.

He awoke only when his corial struck against a tree trunk. He sat up, startled. He dipped his gourd
into the water, washed his face and braced himself for the journey home. Again he passed through
the multitude of bare trees and, because the wind was in his face, it was harder to paddle. The night
was no problem, for the moonlight cast everything in a fabulous beauty. He would have liked to see
a picture of himself, there alone in his corial amid a huge expanse of water and endless rows of
dead trees. And with millions of stars in the distance. He would have saved the picture in his suitcase.
Then he would take it out from time to time to look at it.

Just the way he sometimes removed the picture of Yayomai and himself from the suitcase and
looked at it for a long time. He must have been twenty-five back then, and his wife barely eighteen.
The picture was taken by an American who liked the young couple. Awanga was wearing khaki
shorts and a white undershirt with short sleeves. Just below his knees were the beautiful leg bands

these portraits.

The corial slid quickly and easily between the trees. Thinking about the past had done the old
man good. Now he was close to Afobaka. Lights were on in the huts and the shop on the hill. He
couldn’t see his own hut very clearly. It stood half-hidden behind the tall weeds. Awanga had glanced
at the dam, but turned away again quickly. That monstrosity made him feel impotent and angry. He
paddled harder. He wanted to get home quickly, to look at that picture, especially at Yayomai’s face.
Remembering her had awakened something in him.

He paddled the way he had in one of the corial races long ago, when he had won a silver necklace

and a mirror for his Yayomai. The corial touched bottom and ran up onto the shore. Awanga stood
