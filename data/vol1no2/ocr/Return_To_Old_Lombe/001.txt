Return to Old Lombe

E WAS LITTLE AND OLD, BUT HARD WORK IN THE WOODS ALONG THE

Coppename had left him quite muscular, He was still spry for his age, but he had difficulty
walking because of an old injury, a nasty ax wound on his knee. That’s why he dragged his left leg
when he walked.

This old man, Awanga, lived alone in his hut on a hill close to Afobaka. Every morning he stood
up and looked out at the powerful dam. His gaze would then wander off to the south, where his
native village Lombe had once been. Awanga would see himself, young and strong, in his corial. His
wife Yayomai sat in the bow. He loved her. He also saw his house and the obia hut (shaman’s hut) of
his father, Mataibo, which stood at the base of a huge Kankan tree. Many people in Awanga’s family
enjoyed a prestige resulting from their good relations with the obia. And his father’s services as obia
man were in particular demand among the villagers. Even people from other villages and other rivers
came to Mataibo for help. When this obia man died, Awanga took over his task. For this he had been
trained his whole life.

The death of his wife Yayomai upset him greatly. He heard from friends that there was a woman
living in a village on the Coppename who bore a striking resemblance to Yayomai.

“Tm going there and I’m not coming back until I’ve married het,” Awanga said with enthusiasm.
He dropped everything and left for the Coppename, full of good hope. There he actually met the
woman who was Yayomai’s double. Everyone called her Sisi Mulingi, and she was beautiful and
friendly. She had had only one man in her life. After his death, Mulingi swore never to take another.
No matter how Awanga tried, he could not win her heart. He did receive permission to settle in the
village, for he was a shaman and therefore a very important person. Awanga built his hut and lived
a lonely but peaceful life.

They had started building a dam before he had left his native village. The people who lived in
the area had been told they would have to leave their villages once the construction was finished. A
reservoir would rise behind the dam, and the villages would disappear beneath it. But few people
really believed this. How could they ever leave this place where they had lived for hundreds of years?
This region with its wealth of fish, birds and wild animals, timber and fruit? The white man surely
