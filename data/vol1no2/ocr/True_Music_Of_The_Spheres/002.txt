Language and music are inextricably intertwined by Ms. Marshall's virtuosic craft. She creates
memorable characters who appear on the novel’s virtual stage to perform their part as if in a free-
wheeling jam-session, with each player getting his or her solo turn. Jazz is also the tie that binds the
three young lovers back in Paris. It draws them into a whirlpool of emotions, transforming three
individuals into a single passionate ensemble.

The narration begins in Brooklyn, after Sonny and Hattie’s arrival. Only later we learn details of
the past: the flight from Brooklyn and life in Paris, disclosed bit by bit through Hattie’s
reminiscences. As the story unfolds, we are introduced to an array of powerfully depicted characters,
a series of heartbreaking decisions, tricks and deceits, and to a kind of love that goes beyond
boundaries. Flashbacks are part of Sonny’s narrative, too. Almost everything that happens to him in
Brooklyn is accompanied by a flashback, by a memory of a person back in France, a school friend,
a drunkard ‘baby-sitter’. And the language gets richer and richer, creating a formidable fresco.

The story’s point of view alternates from that of Sonny to that of Hattie, and back. Around the
middle of the novel, Hattie’s voice plays louder; her memories add color to this fresco with
descriptions of what her life was like with Sonny-Rett and Cherisse, her difficulties in raising JoJo,
Sonny’s adolescent mother, her continuous struggle to offer Sonny a decent life. The two narratives
complement each other, with each filling out certain blanks, and each leaving space for the other.

Most of the story is seen through the eyes of 8-year-old Sonny, but told in a language that
probably belongs to an older Sonny. This reading is not at all improbable considering other works
by Ms. Marshall. In the 1966 story, “To Da-duh in Memoriam,” a 9-year-old girl goes from New
York to Barbados to visit relatives she has never met before. Meeting Da-duh, her grandmother, will
change the course of her life. The story is told by the grown-up woman, as experienced by the little
girl but examined through an adult perspective. In Ms. Marshall’s new novel the trip is taken from
Paris to Brooklyn, with Sonny looking at the experience that will change his future.

The abrupt ending is built according to Modernist rules. The story is left unfinished — actions
unseen, facts untold — like an open door unto the future: to be continued. Sonny’s self-questioning
— “whose side would he take, loving them both as he did?” — is part of this opening.

Would Edgar really make public the menage-a-troi that had bound Sonny-Rett, Cherisse and
Hattie? Will Hattie be forced by Edgar’s schemes and the power of his money to give up her hold
on her much loved ward? Though Hattie’s defeat might seem inevitable — “Money’ll do it every time”
— Sonny’s opinion has not been heard yet, and there is no knowing, now, whose side he will take.

The Fisher King is a captivating read, propelled by Ms. Marshall's penetrating insight and
dazzling prose.
