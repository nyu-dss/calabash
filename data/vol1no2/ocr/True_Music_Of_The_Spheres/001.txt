PAULE MARSHALL'S THE FISHER KING

DAS
True Music of the Spheres

ITH THE FISHER KING PAULE MARSHALL SCORES ANOTHER WINNER IN
W. brilliant writing career that began more than 40 years ago with Browngirl, Brownstones
(1959), the seminal novel that guided generations of readers and writers. A winner of a MacArthur
Fellowship and the American Book Award, Ms. Marshall offers here her new jazzy variation on the
famous legend of the Fisher King, with the brown uniform castles of Brooklyn standing for the
Arthurian castles, and 8-year-old Sonny Carmichael Payne as our modern-day Perceval.

The story opens with Sonny on his first trip from Paris, his home, to Brooklyn to visit his two
great-grandmothers, whom he has never met before. Sonny is here with Hattie — his overly-
protective guardian whom he calls “fathermothersisterbrother” — to attend a concert marking the
15th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, the legendary jazz pianist (Everett) Sonny-Rett
Payne.

In her rich, assured prose, Ms. Marshall follows Sonny as he gets to meet Ulene Payne (his
grandfather's mother) and Florence Varina McCallum-Jones (his grandmother's mother), two eternal
rivals who never recovered from their children’s flight to Paris back in the 1940s. There’s also Edgar
Payne, his great uncle, a successful developer who invited him and Hattie and paid for the trip. Edgar
is intent on making Sonny stay in Brooklyn and heal old rivalries and unify the crumbling
community. But Hattie, of course, is in the way. She, who as a young woman loved both Sonny-Rett
and his wife, Cherisse, has no intention of staying or leaving Sonny behind.

Characters’ names in The Fisher King bear special meanings: Florence Varina is named after Varina,
“the only county in Georgia [...] where Colored were allowed to own land”; Sonny is named after
his grandfather and in addition gets also Hattie’s last name, Carmichael; JoJo, Sonny-Rett’s and
Cherisse’s daughter is named after Josephine Baker and Josephine Bonaparte; Sonny-Rett himself
gets his nickname from the “Sonny Boy Blue” tune that changed the course of his own life and that
of the two women who shared it, Hattie and Cherisse.

Jazz music is present throughout the novel. Sonny-Rett’s piano provides a pulsating soundtrack,

playing softly first, then erupting in a “dazzling array of ideas and wealth of feeling” on the page.
