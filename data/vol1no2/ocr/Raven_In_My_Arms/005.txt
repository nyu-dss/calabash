who were foreign and unclean and sick like me, because I knew how life in a body like that felt.
And I knew that children like that laughed and danced and kept secrets.

AND I wAs 19. A FEW MONTHS SHY OF EARNING MY B. A. IN HUMANITIES. I WAS
keeping a secret, from the man I would soon marry. It was December 158 and I was going to let
him make love to me, finally. I met him at his place in New York City’s West Village. We shared
shrimp fried rice from Suzie’s. He tasted me in between bites; I enjoyed my secret. I watched his sexy
ankles as he climbed the stairs to his loft bed. He looked back at me, trailing unusually slowly. I
smiled up at him. He reached for my hand and I had the most unusual thought: “I really like Suzie’s
shrimp.”

We had the usual sexual play. I told myself school was almost finished. I was a good girl and I'd
kept both myself and Rudzani sexually satisfied until I was ready for the real thing.

Then he found out my secret.

He was inside me and I was feeling my body in places I knew I'd only know until I traded this
secret for another one. And I was at the edge of something that was like being 3 and “Mon-eeque,
you winning!” and I'd barely touched my fingers to the wall, the cement wall in the yard in French
Town, the white-washed, brick wall next to Ru’s bed. And I was feeling my body dancing with a
different kind of living and a subtle kind of pain, and it was over too fast, and I gave him baby
punches because he was getting sleepy and I wasn’t sure I could keep this new secret by myself.

And he said, “but, Monique, Mona, hon, I didn’t know.” And when he called me, Mona, for Mona
Lisa, I let him sleep because he was my artist boyfriend, and he waited almost two years to find out
my December 15t secret, and be sleepy after the real thing. And there was left over Suzie’s shrimp
and fried rice for later.

AND I was 20, WITH A “BOUGHT FROM A STREET VENDOR” GREEN AND OPAL RING
on my finger, and engaged to a guy who proposed by tackling me on his new bed (one of Diana’s
old ones) in one of the real bedrooms at Diana’s West Village loft, with Diana’s doves cooing, and
I’m sure without Diana’s white, South African, mother’s maven blessings. And I felt his energy and
desire in a way that a girl is supposed to feel when she’s about to be one of four women joining a
new grad school program in Communications at Hunter College in New York City, with a black
South African artist boyfriend who came to the City on BFA scholarship. I felt his body tackling my
body, his life taking over mine with his sex and his dreams and his subtle abuses. But he brought me
the freshest Zito’s bread on Sunday mornings, and introduced me to the sting of Wasabi on

sushi/sashimi combination. And he called me Mona, for Mona Lisa. And helped me to smell the salt
