AND I WAS 27 GOING ON 28 AND THERE WAS RAVEN. NOT QUITE A YEAR OLD,
but safely past that awkward stage when holding her was like holding Tiffany china in wet fingers.
Now, she was a robust little thing who said “Ba”, that Haitian word for kiss and pursed her lips to
give me one. And Raven in my arms made me wonder how I could be beaten so severely as a child
that red welts decorated my skin—trapped blood, like the trappings of a loving child in a hateful
environment. And Raven made me wonder how my own mother could call me a “worthless little
whore” when I was barely 8 and could continue to call me that until somewhere around 12 when it
wasn’t she who'd stopped but me who didn’t hear it any more. And Raven in my arms was so soft.
I wanted to caress her skin, save her smell, give her “ba” all the time everywhere. And Raven in my
arms made me wonder why Uncle John couldn’t just love me for being a special girl, why he had to
touch me in a way that made me believe that not even my body could be my own special place. And

Raven in my arms challenged my marriage. I didn’t want a Raven with a man who I couldn’t talk to

about all the things that Raven made me think about. And Raven in my arms made me want, for
certain now, a Raven in my arms. But not with him, and not without the intense life of love between
lovers, who turn to face each other and yes, maybe cried or maybe couldn’t speak because the other's

existence at that moment for you and only you makes you want all of life.
