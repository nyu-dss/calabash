breaking free. They carried me at a thunderous pace past Mr. 5 and his brother “6 and change.” And
I was so close to touching the wall and I was so afraid to look back and I could hear them calling
to me from far, far behind and I heard the “Mon-eeeque, you winning!” and I was too “winning”
that long, rough race I was running since 2. And I was screaming because I was doing that thing
that I knew was the thing they were doing all the time when I was 2 and I couldn’t run so fast. And
I was so “free,” even though that’s not what I called it because I didn’t have words like that. And I
was feeling so alive, even though I didn’t know what that was. And I was maybe 20 when I realized
that somebody, probably Mr. 5 and his brother, let me have that thing I was feeling and couldn’t say.
And I still am ready to cry now when my body remembers that feeling, that thing about being 3,
that Mr. 5 and his brother claim they can’t remember with their “Yeah, we used to run a lotta race
and t’ing back then.” All I know is I got my hands on a piece of that life thing; wrapped my arms
around that wildly hungry Raven; felt it so that my being in my body thing was something I was
loving. Especially since one day, sometime after being four, I realized that we —3, 5 and 6, could
have fallen over backwards and “damn near kill all you selves” if we'd made one misstep at the
starting line.

AND THEN I was 8, AND HE WAS RAPING ME, SODOMIZING ME, “BY 'DE WATER
pipe near de USO” and “T’'ll kill you if you make any noise, if you tell anybody.” And I knew that
I couldn’t hold my life in my body just them. I knew I should let the Raven fly, that it’s voracious
appetite was too intense for my little body in ‘de orange dress with white polka dots that Mommy
make on her own sewing machine. And I was there underneath him but I wasn’t, you know... And
when he turned me over to face him, I knew I had to come back, you know..., back, back to my
body, my little body with ‘de too big pink panties that Mommy got from ‘deSalvation Army. I didn’t
want to come back, you know..., but the Raven’s aim was straight, the beak sharp. And I wasn’t 8
again, I was the oldest woman in the oldest body, with the oldest story about being dirty and useless
and less and used because a man put his thing in..., “no not there,” I had to come back. Because he
didn’t have a right to make me so bad because I was good, and life in my body was good. And I
begged him, “please, ... don’t, my father will give you anything. Don’t do it there...; and I looked
at him in his eyes, with the eyes from “Mon-eeque, you winning!”... and he couldn’t put it there and
I think he made me a promise..., but I don’t know if it was good or bad, because I wasn’t in my
head, you know..., I was just in my body. And I was “whole” still, even if I wasn’t. Because I could
lie and say “a man, a man try to rape me in my bum.” And the hospital people could check me and
prove it, and when they ask me about the cut, I could tell them it was ‘de gravel, you know... And,
Mommy could breathe out and ’de hospital lady in ‘de white coat could look me in ‘de eye and she
could see my eye begging her and she could ask Mommy to leave the room and handle ‘de
