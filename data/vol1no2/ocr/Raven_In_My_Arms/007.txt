AND WHILE I WAS BECOMING, IN MY 20’s, MARRIED AND WAITING, I MET A
woman who became my friend after she and her husband (two ordinary island people) had moved
into my building in Brooklyn. A year later, they'd had a child and named her Raven. And Raven in
my arms with her parents loving and sharing her, cloaking her in filial love, fashioning both their
magic and their mistakes out of that love, came to have a profound effect on my becoming...
They're preparation for this child, their commitment to her safe becoming brought back the steady
arm of an older brother, preventing me from falling backwards while perched on the top cement
step, about to take off in the latest race. Something about Raven’s parents standing by in close guard,
cheering as Raven half-walked, half toddled past the sofa’s edge, reaching to touch the wall in front
of her, reminded me of the lack of sound I'd heard when my brothers had stopped running so I
could break free and forge ahead. I remember, hearing the words as if they’d filled in my memories
for the first time.” On your mark...” I knew what I wanted..., “Get set...” I arranged my career,
capitalized on my Master's thesis, accepted that my family history wasn't my family future. “GO!”

AND I wAs 27 AND MOANING AND CRYING AND IN SUCH AN UNUSUAL SEXUAL
position, I kissed the inside of my own knee because something had to be kissed. The feeling of
my eighth orgasm in one night could no longer be described as a feeling: it was a different kind of
existence. I was never more simultaneously awake and yet in deepest dream as I was that late Spring
night. When Rudzani was finished with me, or me with him, he held me on our bed, my back facing
his. I curled my fingers in his, squeezed them, pulled his big hands tighter around my little waist-
line he loved to marvel at. He made a sound that was clearly his, not the man I'd had to imagine |
was with in order to have this night. I kept my gaze on the wall next to our bed a little longer,
touched the smoothed roughness of the sheet-rocked wall with the tips of my fingers. I was going
to do it. I was going to turn around and face him. I would know my secret if I did, but I was long
tired of the secrets my body held in order to hold on to the life I'd seized. I turned swiftly, before |
could stop myself; I looked at his face and let myself in on my own humiliating secret. I did not love
him. I'd only needed him to justify me as a sexual woman, to give me a wall to touch when I was
tired of all the running it took to stay in a life that was filled with secret horrors that sometimes
crippled me. I hadn’t expected he would become one of them. I immediately got out of bed and
went to the living room. I’m not sure when I started crying, but I knew that when I did, I was finally
free of him and all the reasons I needed him. My body was 3 again and I was running and I was
“Mon-eeque, you winning!” This time, being 3 was different from the first time; this time, I wasn’t
afraid to look back, I just couldn’t.
