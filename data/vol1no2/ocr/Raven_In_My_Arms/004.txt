was born and Daddy used to dance with me for tourists at hotels, and they called me “Wire Waist”
at weddings and parties back home in Antigua. But the whole dance thing doesn’t need a beginning.
It’s like a chronic attack of that intense ass living thing in this changeable coffer of a body thing
that’s always had me. I love to move this body, feel it hitting the ground, shake the wind around any
space I'm in. And those wicked song writers who wrap me up in lyrics and sounds, Joan, Bob, John,
Macy, Peter, Tina, Nelson, Johnny, Paul, Natalie,...; 1 could fill pages with the stuff they do to me,
how Grace and Martin come and find me in my sane, quiet spaces and make me late for work,
working my body inside of, around, underneath, and above some tune they wrote just ‘cause I
happened to be feeling just that thing this morning. Don’t get me started with Juan Luis and Gloria
finding me at some club where I only came to celebrate Gina’s going away party, to have a glass of
Cranberry juice and leave ‘cause I’m so tired, but wind up staying, forcing half the party off the
dance floor and looking down at some guy on his knees still trying to wiggle to keep up with me.
Wearing out suitors and rousing husbands and otherwise committed lovers for “just one dance,
Monique,” unwilling to think about their women sitting and sipping envy.

Then comes the late night, solitaire dances — doused in lonely, stomping out rage and fright,
snapping away tomorrow, clapping up hope. Quieting to slow, lyrical melodies as Andreas and
candles register a Raven’s cries, swooning and circling till they find someway to gorge on delight.
And the sweet, womanly sweat that signals complete exhaustion conjures “that chil’, you see she
wiggling since she born.” And I’m winning when I dance; I’m getting away with that rip off of a
very particular piece of heaven, ‘cause my body dancing shows off all of life. And God is happy.

AND, I’M IN MY BED, AND I’M REMEMBERING THAT I’M 11 AGAIN, THAT I WANT
to forget that I was that age and that sick with a thyroid condition, wanting to give back the life I
grabbed for a little spell. I feel my body, aching in places inside that I didn’t really know a body had.
The joints, the bones, my head, my hair falling out, my neck stuck to one side, the left, a sore oozing
from where Mommy tried to medicate what she thought was the mumps by tying hot, sweet potatoes
about my neck, near my thyroid glands. The heat, the island heat I could never tolerate, feeling
hotter, and fiercer. My thoughts, a haze. I hear talk I’m not supposed to hear about death and
“nastiness” causing my illness. Quarrels about cleanliness. And I want to die because I'm so tired of
being poor and foreign and unclean and a problem. I ask somebody (not God, because he wouldn't
like it) to let me die. And I heard some people laughing, and a radio playing the latest calypso song,
and Mommy was eating sweet pastry like she was never going to have another sweet thing in her
life. And my brothers were trading science facts, and my little sister was fat and smiling. And I asked
God to let me live. Because if he'd just do that for me, I'd dedicate my life to poor children who
didn’t have money for the doctor or sweet pastries or the latest set of encyclopedias. But mostly those
