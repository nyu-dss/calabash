Calabash

of the City with his sophisticated Soweto, Johannesberg self: And I felt my body awake with anger
at his offenses, my heart consumed by the want for his love, my infamous courage flayed by his
persistent controls. But being a woman, underneath him, beside him, on top of him...Having my
childhood sodomy cleansed, my menstrual cycle welcomed, my orgasms justified, my “you t'ink you
is a woman” validated by the scepter of marriage was what I needed to feel okay at 21 with grabbing
the exploits of life and riveting their rhythms into my body.

AND THEN I was 22, TURNING 23 WHEN THE OTHER ILLNESS SET IN. IT HAD NO
name for over 6 months. A black woman who was not rich did not fit the profile for Epstein Barr.
It was a yuppie disease. And whatever my muscle aches, flu-like symptoms, extreme exhaustion was
about, it was certainly not caused by the disease of the privileged. And it was my own damned fault
for thinking that foreign, poor, unclean women who slept with foreign, poor, teargassed-spotted men
had some kind of claim to that “always-on-the-go life.” I should be teaching at an inner-city high
school, not trying to hold significant administrative positions in education and write cutting-edge
historical media thesis for Masters in Communications programs. I should keep my orgasms in check,
leave art openings to Madison Avenue socialites, and get used to being a tired, black woman. And
sometimes I did. Then for the first time, I started having gratitude for my illness because without the
amazing energy it took to be me outside and deal with Rudzani’s controls inside, I got a raven-eyed
view of how I'd been living. Of how my active, capable body was caging my life. I found myself,
sitting at the side of my tub, clutching at my stomach, pounding softly there, sounding the words
until the volume was finally audible to me, saying “I have a right to exist, I have a right to exist, I
have),.., exist... Tight,”

I found the right doctor, Dr. Granderson, an island man who didn’t balk at my island remedies
for general nourishment and stamina. I researched health. I dismissed the New Age when it dipped
too far into my purse and insulted my everyday need to be on this flawed planet. I looked at my
dreadlocked, sophisticated, talented, sexy husband and still saw his abuse for what it was. I wasn’t
willing to give him my energy yet. I was waiting, like the Raven, for a time when I could cry out
somewhere other than in the silence of my bathroom at the edge of the tub. Someplace, sometime
when I didn’t care that our friends thought my Rudzani was a talented, dedicated, pacific guy who
I was lucky to have. When I could be the woman I was, without needing him to justify my pleasures
or rationalize my pain. I was precariously perched at the top of the cement steps, focussed on
keeping myself steady, listening for the “on your mark, get set, GO!” that would allow me to run
towards the break free of “Mon-eeque, you winning!”
