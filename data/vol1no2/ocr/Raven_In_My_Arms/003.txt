paperwork, so she could hold me, and hold me, and she could keep my secret ‘cause she see how
Mommy aint have any money, and Mommy come from some foreign island and ‘de hospital lady
feel to my little body like she know what it’s like to be the oldest woman in the oldest body and to
want to be 8 again.

AND THEN I WAS 11, GOING ON 12.

But I was living inside every woman's age, because I was wearing a yellow panty and spotting red
blood. But I'd read a booklet, “brought to you by Kotex” that told me becoming a woman was
beautiful and natural. That I could still ride a bike, even swim while having my menstrual flow.
Which was funny because I didn’t know how to do either, even though I lived on an island with a
long stretch of waterfront and at least a dozen beaches. It was so nice to have somewhere that my
brothers who could bike, swim, and climb trees couldn’t have if they tried. I was in this woman
dream, tossing my five or six braids around, seeing myself in a pale green skirt set, biking my sexy,
woman self in my breezy silk skirt and matching tee.

So by ’de time Mommy brought home some olivey green pieces ftom the Salvation Army and I'd
worn the things into submission, it was a genuine shock to my woman dream the day my mother
spotted some menstrual blood that seeped its secret onto my faded, green courdroy skirt and jarred
me into some other kind of woman body. The one where my mother sat me down, chided me for
becoming a “young lady” without letting her know that I was now a potential threat to the family’s
stability and good name. That anybody who could keep that kind of secret could not be trusted.

And I could feel ‘de hospital lady in ‘de white coat holding me, and I could feel the tampon
that was half in, half out, I was so tight, and I could feel my brothers laughing at me. And I left
my head so I didn’t have to hear my mother, until I listened again and heard she was making me
quit my job as Shampoo Girl at the beauty salon because “you t’ink you is a woman.” But that’s
what I wanted: to be a woman in green who read too many books and knew how to masturbate
and give herself an orgasm at 12. But I also wanted to keep my job. Even if it was mostly really
sweeping up, buying the pizza, and only half-reading magazines while the women talked. So, |
pretended to be sorry. And I was because I didn’t honestly want to hurt my mother. And it was a
rough, edgy life in this body kinda thing; me, pretending it was my first menstrual cycle, that I

needed to be taught how to use pads, and that “no make no man touch you” was sound sexual
advice for a sodomized, orgasmic pre-teen.

AND NOW, THEN, ALWAYS I AM NOT CONTAINABLE AS A SPECIFIC AGE, A CERTAIN

woman, when I'm dancing. I don’t know when I found it, but Mommy says I was wiggling when I
