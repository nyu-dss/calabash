Raven in my Arms

LOVE MY BODY.
I It contains for me not just the pleasures in life, but the intensity of life, and for reasons
unknown to me, life’s intensity is what makes it true for me.
I feel like a stinking cheat sometimes, like I stole my life away from it’s ethereal place and hid it
deep down in a woman’s womb.
Waiting for a moment to get out and wrap the thing up in rhythm, stick it up some winking God's

brothers, 2 and 3 years older than I, but existing as one entity in my dreamy memory, had been
running races against me within the vast parameters of “from ’de top of ‘de concrete step to over
there by ‘de wall.” And though I did not understand it as winning, I knew that there was something
precious that could come at the end of these races that could only be defined by having it. Then
