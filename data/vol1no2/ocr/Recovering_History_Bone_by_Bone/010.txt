ing the Occupation, there were a lot of rapes, lots of children who were born from

the results of that, from Americans who were there...
ED: ...or even from the recent Occupation.

MC: Exactly, and also with the crossings to the DR. I’m not fascinated by it but it’s a
question that keeps coming back. It’s like a haunting in a way: the way race is uti-
lized in order to oppress darker people across class and, of course, that disadvan-
tages most Haitians in the general population. There’s a way in which by denying
the fact that there have been these continuous mixings prevents a conversation
about what race means now and why we're still using race as a way to classify peo-
ple and to either marginalize them within Haiti and the DR, and refuse them cer-
tain kinds of rights, human rights in particular, or shut them down elsewhere. What
I'm leading to is that with the twins, it seemed that there was an allegory being
posed in the novel. I like the fact that the daughter is the one who survives. Not
because I wanted the lighter child to die or something but there was something in
the fact that she had survived and gone on. Even Valencia at the end of the novel
talks about her and Amabelle is able to see all the photographs of her growing up
and being the darker child in all of the pictures. And the fact that Amabelle was
connected to her at the beginning of the novel suggests that there was a commen-
tary on your part about Haitians being able to survive, whether it was racial encod-

ing, whether it was class encoding, that there was more to [her survival] than that.

ED: For me, I think that we have to — and this is a recurring question in the anthology
too — I was very surprised how much color was mentioned. And in reading the
whole thing through and reading other things [I concluded] we have to accept
nuance. But Haiti isn’t like Brazil, or these other places. There is a mixture but the
majority of the population looks African. Sometimes that is linked to class, to the
extent that some people who are darker will go to places, for example, at the air-
port, and speak French to differentiate themselves from the rest of the people.

There's often a very strong effort to say “I’m not what I appear” — if you appear a
certain way.

For instance, I went to visit a friend of mine at a hotel in Haiti and I spoke to
the man at the front desk in Kreyol and the man said to me: “Madam, li trop bon
pou ou vin la. Tann a swe.” The implication was that I was a prostitute picking

somebody up. I had to really struggle then not to slip, the thing you need to do to
