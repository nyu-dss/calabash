I think it goes back also to these daily struggles. There’s nobody guarding our legacy,
you know? I know people who were in the service during the second invasion who
talked about people just taking cannon balls and if you go to the Citadel someone

will sell you a cannon ball. And if you want one, you can walk away with it.
Everything’s for sale.

It’s just out in the open. And maybe it’s because the daily struggles are so great that

we haven't put aside the time for that kind of museum you're talking about, in
Cuba.

That's part of it. I guess I also get a sense — when I was standing in the Moncada
— of feeling this great pain. Not because of just what had gone on there but that
people there — even though Cuba is going through its own trials — they had a
sense of something that was past. What they’re going through today is what they’re
going through today and it isn’t connected [necessarily] to what happened before
1959, in the strict sense. Especially for Afro-Cubans since life was much harder
before the Revolution, for most Afro-Cubans. And so, I think I was struck by the
fact that there is a way in which even though the Duvalier regime ended in 1986-
87, for many people, even people who are outside of Haiti, all of the things that
happened during that time, [are] not over. And it’s not to say that we're only speak-
ing of Duvalierisme or Neo-Duvalierisme but a sense that, because there's been so
much forgetting or putting aside of memory, sometimes simply to survive, that there
hasn't been an opportunity to almost regain one’s footing and to learn the lessons

of the past in order not to repeat them. Do you see what I mean?
Oh, yes, it’s true.

Actually, that makes me think of the epigraph to your novel from Judges because
when I read that I had to stop before proceeding into the book, not because I did-
n’t want to go ahead and read, but because I didn’t remember that passage from the
Bible. It was chilling because it was a reminder of how history repeats itself. It’s
such a perfect parallel to what has been going on between Haitians and Dominicans
for hundreds of years, at least for the last hundred years or so, even right down to
the numbers killed mentioned in Judges, 40,000, which I think is the number that
many Haitian historians have used [to estimate the numbers killed during the cane

field massacres].
