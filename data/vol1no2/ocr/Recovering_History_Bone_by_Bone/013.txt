sages from the novel where people laugh at moments where you know we would
want to cry the most. So, it’s interesting that Amabelle — whom I don’t believe ever
does cry in the novel — is always linked to rivers. I think there’s that English

expression crying yourself a river.
Yeah. ..crying yourself a river.

She is protected in these scenes by Metrés Dlo to whom she dedicates this story.
What I wanted to ask first about was that tone because it’s very clear that you want
to keep yourself as an author from judging, from judging history, from judging
those who were involved in that history, from laying blame, it would seem.
Especially given the fact that we have Amabelle’s relationship to Valencia and at the
end of the novel we find out how Valencia survived that moment in history [of the
cane field massacres] and how she tried to help those that she could, even though
she was in a marriage with someone who did not respect those Haitians who were
working on his land. And so I’m wondering about, as a Haitian novelist, as you re
trying to retell this story, and the horrors of these times, as you did in your other
works on contemporary history, how do you try to both tell the story and keep from
laying blame. Because one of the things I also noticed is that despite that tone, there
is a subtle linking throughout the novel of Trujillo's regime, Vincent’s collusion in
Haiti and what you call the “Yankee presence” on both sides of the island. At the
times when the characters seem the most afraid of what this massacre means, or the
impending massacre, they make references to the “Yankees” and the occupations or
that “the Yankees are coming back.” The question, then, is about judgment. How
do you try to tell the story as honestly as you can and still keep yourself out of the

area of providing an authorial judgment?

I think and I’ve always tried not to take the easy way out of things. When I talk to
people, you know, sometimes it’s not easy. Over Breath, Eyes, Memory, I've had so
many fights with people. And I would say to them, “Why don’t you look more
closely at what is making you angry?” I think we're in a position as Haitians, and I
include myself in this — a lot of our hands are dipped in blood in some way. Just
our own history of how our people were treated by our own makes it hard to sit
in judgement on other people and that’s always in the back of my head when |
think about this massacre. I think first of these people, how they were treated, and

then I think of them going home and their government receiving fifty cents for
