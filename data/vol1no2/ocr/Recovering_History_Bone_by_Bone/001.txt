Recovering History “Bone by Bone”

CONVERSATION WITH EDWIDGE DANTICAT

DWIDGE DANTICAT CAME TO NATIONAL ATTENTION AS A PROMISING YOUNG
E American writer at age twenty-four with the publication of her first novel, Breath, Eyes, Memory
(1994), a bildungsroman produced at the crossroads of US and Haitian realities recounting the
travails of a young Haitian girl displaced from the arms of a warm, woman-centered family, to rejoin
her estranged mother for a new life in the United States. Once there, Sophie, the novel’s protagonist,
must confront the shadows cast on her life by the Duvalier regime and the haunting of her own
begetting through the rape of her mother by a Duvalier henchman, or Tonton Macoute. Lyrically
rendered, the novel opened a path for the inclusion of Haitian realities in the American imagination
and opened the door for the publication of Danticat’s short story collection Krik? Krak! —
nominated for the National Book Award. Commenting on one of the stories in the collection,
“Night Women”, biographer Lenore L. Brady offers that Danticat’s reader is “immersed in a spatial
and temporal split...a split [that is] determined by the politics of race, class, and gender and
articulated in an angle of vision that combines the stark reality of a single woman's material
impoverishment/ poverty with the spiritual abundance/hopefulness of ancestors and angels” (205).
Such a description of Danticat’s work can well be applied to her latest offering to the literary world
with the appearance of her second novel, The Farming of Bones (1998). The Farming of Bones delves
into a stark moment of Haitian history, commonly known as the Cane Field Massacres of 1937,
when Trujillo, the then-dictator of the Dominican Republic, ordered the killing of Haitian field
workers within the Dominican borders in an effort to “de-Haitianize” the DR. Given the continued
animosity between the two nations and the continued exploitation of Haitian workers within the
DR, the novel provides a mirror to contemporary actualities even as it seeks to unveil the terror and
errors of the past. Sensitively written, the novel follows the story of Amabelle Désir, a young
domestic living in the DR at the time of the massacres and betrothed to a cane field worker who
himself goes missing. Invoked throughout are “ancestors and angels” — the guiding forces of
spiritual awakefulness in a time of darkness and the seeming extinguishment of hope.

In the following interview, Danticat speaks of the parallels between the Haitian genocide and
