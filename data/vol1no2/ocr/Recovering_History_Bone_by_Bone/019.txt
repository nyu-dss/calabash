But it comes at a cost.

Absolutely. I think because I was raised in Canada — well, Haiti and Canada but I
went to school in Canada — there are certain things I have yet to understand about
the United States. I’ve been in the States ten years but there are lots of things that
I still don’t understand about the US, especially racially. It's led me to think about
the fact that the US has so much history in the Caribbean. What I’ve been discov-
ering as I've been doing this project is that I don’t think it can be easy to be both
a Caribbean person and American. I remember talking about this with Maritza
Perez and she was saying that in a way it’s something that you can’t separate in
terms of identity. And, also, when I spoke to Magda Campos-Pons, the Cuban artist
— she came here in her late twenties for the first time, I think, and then stayed. She
spoke about how she saw the United States as sort of a place to travel through, that
if she hadn’t come here, there are certain things she wouldn’t understand about
Cuba but then that there will be another place after the US. That made me pause
and think about, again, it’s like what you were saying about everyone having their
own Haiti, that you can still define yourself culturally in ways that either incorpo-
rate an American identity or, even if doesn’t, still provides you an opportunity to
have a different perspective, which is also an opportunity, I would think.

Absolutely. It’s an opportunity for any artist or for any writer. It’s hard to step out
and look at things from the outside. We are, supposedly, outside of society anyway,
not that you have to leave the country. Even inside the country there are people who
are doing certain kinds of work. Even living inside they are looking from outside
because that’s their work.

Well, I have two more questions connected to what you've just said. The first one is
about Father Romain who early in the novel claims that “Memory, though painful,
will make you strong.” And at the end of the novel, I believe, he’s the same person

who loses his mind.
Yes.
(LAUGHTER)

It’s interesting to me because Amabelle comments on how, on some level, she
wishes she could lose her mind because then she might forget. And then she talks
about being dead but remembering. I’m sort of wondering about that whole
