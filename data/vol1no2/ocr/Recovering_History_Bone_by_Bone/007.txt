through so many immigrant screenings because we were flying “Air d’Haiti.” And,
you know, all of a sudden, the customs man wants to have a conversation: “What
were you doing? Where do you work?” Just to hear you speak. Some Dominican
friends have said that coming from Puerto Rico, they get a whole lot of conversa-
tion so that they [Customs] can hear the difference in certain words they’re asked

to say. Because Puerto Ricans and Dominicans speak differently.
It’s a way to classify people.
Yes, And so, there's that. If you take it further, there’s that kind of continuation.

I hadn't known about that. One of the things that I’ve been exploring, looking at
the three countries, has been racial formation — just how race works. Because what
got me started on the project is the fact that I’m part Dominican — my grandfather

on my mother’s side was Dominican.
Yes. You told me. A bunch of Haitian families are like that.

...which is also something that isn’t talked about. One of the things that
intrigued me growing up was that I didn’t know that family. There were three
things, when I was growing up, that I knew about in terms of Haitian history that
were always talked about: the Revolution, the US Occupation and the Massacres.
One of the things I had to deal with was that, in my case, the Dominican con-
nection was a positive one. The Dominican part of my family had emigrated to
Haiti in order to, actually, have a better life. Of course, this was when Haiti was
doing far better [economically] than it is doing now. And so at the same time in
terms of the history my sense of what I was told of the Massacres was that there
was something terrible going on, on the other side ofthe island, that we didn’t
want to know about. Then I was confronted with the fact that I was part
Dominican and that there wasn’t that animosity within my family. So, one of the
questions I always had to deal with is race because that grandfather came from a
family [which included some well-known writers, whom] I just discovered as I've
been reading who have been quoted as being racist, anti-Haitian. It shocked me
because I started realizing that the racial issues are really, really deep. I needed to
understand why I had the impression that my grandfather was white even though
he was mixed. I wanted to figure out why there was all this animosity between

Haitians and Dominicans. At first it seems — well, it is racial — some people talk
