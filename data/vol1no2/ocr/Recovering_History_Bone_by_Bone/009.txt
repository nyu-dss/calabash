that illusion of people going there and then coming back and so forth. And I
thought it was more dissipated. And the whole thing about this history and the
Occupation and this forced joining, there is a fear on both sides that it’s going to
become one mess.

I didn’t think of it all that way through but I think that the idea of perception
is one thing. But, what was most interesting, once you got close to the border, was
to notice how inevitable the mixtures are. Maybe it’s that rare Dominican who can
say “I am a pure White.” But, sometime the discussion stops when people will say
“Well, look at my Uncle. How can I be racist? He looks like you. You could be part
of my family.” And then you're looking at the Uncle who silences the discussion
that needs to take place, that the Uncle is not looked at in the same way as the other

Uncles,
Exactly.

And there’s that uncomfortable way of not being able to talk about things because
there is this whole range in families, as there are in Haitian families. In the same way
that sometimes we are uncomfortable saying that when one child enters the room,
everybody is cooing as opposed to when another child enters. That happens in

Haitian families too.

There’s still the issue of colorism. It’s interesting because it’s a broader issue that
Haitians have not talked about, as much as they should, I think. I know that even
surrounding the political issues today or even the discussions that happened, that I
was privy to, mostly in the States, after Jean’s [Dominique] killing, people talked a
lot about color. When of the things I've experienced is that people...make a lot of
assumptions about class and privilege based on what I look like and I'm always
forced to acknowledge that there’s a way in which, when people think of Haiti,
they will divide the population into the 90% and 10% and not allow themselves to
think about all the things that have happened over time since enslavement to the
present day. Even though it is true that Haiti looks far more African than the other
nations, whether it’s Cuba or the DR, or whatever, there are lots of mixings that
have taken place, and though the racial issues are definitely still there with respect
to the darker people, we haven't faced the fact that there is also the class issue and
that it often crosses the color lines. The reason I've been thinking about this is not

only because of my own background but because of the fact that, for example, dur-
