the Jewish Holocaust in terms of the need to provide testimony for the departed. Our
conversation began with a fortuitous error on my part over the award garnered by The Farming of
Bones, fortuitous in that the clarification which followed provided the foundation for a fruitful
discussion on the gaps and liabilities of “official” history and the plausibility of redefining and
creating multifocal identities within the Americas. Forthcoming from Danticat, in collaboration

with Soho Press, is an edited collection of writings by Haitian/American writers entitled
The Butterfly’s Way (2001).

First of all, I wanted to congratulate you on the National Book Award, for The
Farming of Bones. Part of what that award made me think about is the fact that it
seems to me that one of your roles as a writer — one of the roles that you take up
— is to be a witness for Haitians, especially those Haitians who don’t have a voice.
I wondered if since you received the award you've felt that there has been more
attention paid to the traumas that Haitians, common Haitians, have been enduring

throughout history, not just in the present.

In a way, the award that I got — and by the way, it’s not the National Book
Award — is an even more special award in that it’s the American Book Award
given by a group called The Before Columbus Society. They define America by
all the Americas so that there were maybe thirty of those given out to novelists,
poets, editors and so on, That was a very special award. It was given out in LA
and my parents went [to the awards ceremony] and, in a sense, I felt, especially
with this book, that it was really satisfying since the subject matter deals with a
struggle over the scars of history. And this award, given by The Before Columbus
Society, addresses those types of scars. So, I was very glad to get that given their
definition of American, because people like me struggle with the definition and
this is a very inclusive definition of America that acknowledges all of the
Americas. So, I was particularly happy for the book to have received that.
I think that awards in general... well, often I get awards I've never heard of...
