about it as “ethnic.”

The difficulty to reconcile is the fact that under Trujillo a lot of dark-skinned
Dominicans were killed. In the conversation I had with Loida Maritza Pérez
about her novel Geographies of Home, we talked about the fact that Dominicans
have also been scarred by Trujillo, their own identities and memory. But, to iden-
tify as part-Haitian or to understand that there is a very narrow connection
between the two communities is to have to awaken to that history and it’s not
something that’s easy to do especially if you are dark Dominican because it puts
you at risk within your very own community.

So, what struck me with the opening of your novel was the twin birth, because
I know that with Breath, Eyes, Memory there was the marassa [cult of twins] theme
running through, which I thought was such a compelling way to speak of the ways
in which history has conspired to distort vodou imagery and the ways in which peo-
ple connect with one another. And in this novel, there is something similar going
on, especially because we have a physical twin. I think Doctor Javier says: “It’s as if
the other one tried to strangle her.” The lighter-skinned child is larger and the
darker-skinned child is female and is the one who survives. I had to wonder about
that because the other thing that was interesting in that scene, the birth scene, is that
the mother, Valencia [who is Dominican], suggests to Amabelle [her domestic] that
the girl-child takes after Amabelle. There's definitely a connection between the two
women as if they know they share the same blood, the same history. I wondered if
that was intentional. Well, it seemed as if it was intentional but I wanted to ask you

about it.

ED: Well, it was intentional in the sense that, to me, it’s always been fascinating to me,
this whole idea of the DR and Haiti as one. It’s sort of the opposite of the marassa.
It’s the same but it’s also the opposite in a way because it’s one thing that’s split in
two as opposed to two things trying to become one, it’s one thing split right down
the middle. [With twins] we are told that it’s one egg divided down the middle, in
the womb. It’s always fascinated me that — and perhaps this is my perception —
for most people, even those who have Dominicans who are family, I don’t think that
we [Haitians] are daily consumed by Dominicans the way Dominicans are with
Haitians. I'd heard of people going — to cut cane in the cane field, to work in the
cane field. Still, I was with Ségin this last time and we were up in the mountains

and someone said “Fi sa a li tal dan Dominicani y li vin tounen rich” There’s still
