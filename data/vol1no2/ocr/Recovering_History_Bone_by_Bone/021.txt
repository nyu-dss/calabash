And maybe even — these same ladies were telling me — behind every mad man
there’s a small kind of genius. And when you think even of people who have a
mental illness — maybe it’s a kind of a mindful concentration, like the professeur
at the end who kind of strolls the river. Or Father Romain who is obsessed with
the kites. Maybe it takes someone who is extremely hyper-focused on one task to
forget the larger things in life. But the professor, in his own way, is a survivor.

For this book, I read a lot of Holocaust memoirs. People coped in many differ-
ent ways. There were people who committed suicide thirty or forty years after the
fact. And there were people who became wealthy but they became, I think, auto-
focused or they had their own way of forgetting. And Amabelle was hoping to for-
get but she couldn’t. The Father and the others were able to sort of disappear into
this other kind of darkness. People are seeking different ways of escaping the pain.
Psychosis too is a way of the mind helping us out, blocking things out.

That's right. Without romanticizing mental illness, I’m also thinking that within the
novel and within real life, it’s almost as if those are the memorials, the memorials
we were talking about that don’t exist. When you travel through areas that have
experienced great harm, great harm to human life and you find people like this, it
is a reminder of what has happened. Even if they have forgotten. You know what
I mean? It’s that sense of a living testament to the horror that would lead to that
kind of forceful forgetting.

Oh yes. I was reading all the essays again for The Butterfly’s Way and we used yours

as the closing essay.
That's nice.

I think of what you said about — I remember so clearly because I just read it again
— how much you said about the body remembering pain and maybe the body
remembering also good touch. I was really struck by that because I concentrate
more on the pain myself. How wonderful a thought that is. Just now, I was think-
ing that when the book starts over in a way, it’s kind of like Amabelle remember-

ing the good touch.

That’s right. Because it’s after all of this has happened. That leads me to my final
question which is about butterflies — partly because I’ve always had a thing about
butterflies.
