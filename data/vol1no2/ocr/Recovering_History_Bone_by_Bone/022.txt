ED: One of my life’s obsessions.
MC: Yes.

MC: 1 was struck by that when you work started appearing — there are always butter-
flies and the anthology is called The Butterfly’s Way. When I was growing up, I used
to think there’s something Haitian about this but I don’t know what it is so, when
your work came out, I said to myself, “Ah, I was right.” The thing I’ve had with but-

I’m going back in September with Sonia Sanchez, who has always wanted to go to
Haiti. So we're going to go walk up to the Citadel with her. And so just going high
and the whole idea of the saying “behind the mountains, more mountains” — My
family is from this place that’s a ten hour walk from the nearest city and having to
walk there as a child and being so resentful and going back there as an adult and
all the different spins of walking higher — I’ve always noticed these butterflies.
This last time, I noticed this very green butterfly that I had never seen before in my
