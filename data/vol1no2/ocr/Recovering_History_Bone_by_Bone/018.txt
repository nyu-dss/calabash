MC: At least there’s a lot of love.

ED: Frankly Myriam, I don’t think, given my family’s economic situation, I don’t think
I would have been able to be a writer in Haiti. I probably would have written but I
don’t think I could have afforded it. It’s a privilege that migration has afforded me.
I probably would just be struggling to make a living, that I wouldn’t be able to be
sitting down and writing. So, I think we are all doing that thing that we are given
and sometimes I feel like — going back to what you talked about in the beginning
— I think we are in places, if you are in Canada or in the United States or if you
are in France, where there are more opportunities, for publishing and so forth. But
I think that what I’m writing has as much to do with Haiti as it does with migra-
tion. But I don’t think I’m cheating anybody of an opportunity to write, what they

want to write but sometimes that’s the perception.

MC: | think that all you've said is well taken and I think that migration does afford
opportunities that one couldn’t have. One of the things that I was reminded of is
when I was in Haiti last year and I did an interview for a radio show and I was asked
what I thought were the greatest struggles for Haitian women. You know, I rattled
off all of the different things, and at the break the person who was interviewing
me said that to do work on women’s issues in Haiti was very difficult. In fact, it
could be very dangerous, whatever class you might be in. She talked about her sis-
ter, who I believe is an activist and upper-class, but who has been shunned by every-
one in her community because of the work she does. Also when I talked to
members of the women’s cooperatives, some of the issues that could not be spo-
ken aloud were clearly serious issues — we talked about things like domestic vio-
lence — but we couldn’t really talk clearly about rape or the AIDS issue. It made
me think about how much work those women are doing on the front lines and yet
there are things that they can’t talk about and it seems that for those who are on
the outside and have the privilege of going back and forth or speaking our mind —
it’s a privilege I won't take lightly,

ED: Absolutely. It’s not only the social dangers. There are women I know who are work-
ing with women who were raped during the coup. I think people assume that there

are built-in divisions and that there are ways in which women can't help each other.
