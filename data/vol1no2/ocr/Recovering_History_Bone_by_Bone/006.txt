ED: Yes.

MC: So, it made me think ahead to the contemporary situation because I wondered about
your intentions in using the Judges epigraph. It made me think of how history is
repeating itself today.

ED: My Uncle is a minister, a Baptist minister, and I was talking to him. He was asking
what I was doing and I told him and he was the one who told me about this pas-
sage. I'm not knowledgeable enough about the Bible to quote scripture except for
a couple you learn in Sunday school. But, when he told me about that, I thought,
for me, it was chilling as well. And other people would keep telling me other things
about [struggles] between different groups, like Iraq and Iran, and they would
explain to me certain works but it was just that I couldn’t find certain documenta-
tion. But they would tell me stories in which differentiation would be used to tell
people apart before they were killed. So, for me, I learned some valuable
things/lessons doing the anthology... Sometimes I meet people who want to write
and they have this idea that because you are Haitian or because people haven’t heard
all we have to say that it’s new. I’m not even talking about universality and all that
but there are people who think it’s all new. Sometimes, you think that if you read
enough, you'll encounter this, that there’s a lot that people repeat in their actions.

We had twenty-nine years of a mad dictatorship. In the DR, they had 30-some-
odd years of Trujillo. These people, they are mad but there is also a sort of mad
genius in what they do. Trujillo, for example, studied Hitler, and there are pictures
of him dressed like Hitler. Duvalier studied the people and used myth and folklore
as his weapons, as his mental weapons. They also studied the past and maybe even
without knowing it something had been [implanted] in them about the ways peo-
ple had been terrorized before. You can’t be one person, surrounded by a couple of
people, and hold millions of people hostage without some sense of history your-
self and what’s being repeated through what you're doing. I think that’s what, at
times, puts the people at a disadvantage who are the victims of this history. But the
people who are the perpetrators know what has happened before and I truly believe
that consciously or not, they have examples of what works in horror, And so, for
me, when I got to [the passage in Judges], it stopped me. But, today, some
Dominican friends told me after that they had a similar experience. . it happened to

me yesterday...when you get to the airport, you know. Man — I had never gone
