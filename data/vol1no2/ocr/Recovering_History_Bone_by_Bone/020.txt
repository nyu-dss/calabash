idea...the way I’m connecting it in my mind to what you've just said about migra-
tion is how psychosis can be a way of being on the outside. I’m also thinking about
people that I would come across when I was a child in Haiti; this would have been
in the late seventies. They were supposedly crazy but they were perfectly...sane? I
don’t know how to explain that. People who did not do the normal kinds of things
— for instance, I remember this woman who had a very small child and she spent
her days picking up colored pieces of glass, and when I would ask about that, peo-
ple would either say that she was crazy or they would say, matter-of-factly, that this
is what she was doing and they wouldn't really question it. The way I read it was

that it was a coping mechanism...
ED: Exactly.

MC: ...that she still knew what was going on and, of course, at that time in history with
all the things that were going on in Haiti, there were lots of people doing odd
things because that’s just how you survive. And so, at the end of the novel, I was
kind of thinking that Father Romain has lost his mind but I think it’s his sister who
says he has moments of clarity.

ED: One time when I was at the border on a market day, a man, exactly like the
Professeur, was strolling. He would always show up on market days wearing a suit.
One time he grabbed me and kissed me and I had a reaction. This woman said, as
I was trying to wipe the kiss away, that when a crazy person kisses you, it brings
you luck. I didn’t quite believe. You don’t believe but it made me think of Haitian
optimism. A friend told us a joke when in Jacmel. He said that that this is a Haitian
way of looking at things — a man is hit by some bird-do and he gets mad. One of
his friends says, “Why get mad? Look at the up side of it.” And the man says, “What
could be the up side of this?” And he says, “Just be grateful that cows don’t fly.”

(LAUGHTER)

ED: That made me think of coping mechanisms exactly as you were saying, and that
humor for Haitians is a huge coping mechanism. Even before the tragedies hap-
pened, a couple of blagues [jokes] developed around them so that maybe, in lieu of
having a good cry as we were saying earlier, in lieu of crying, that’s what we do —

we laugh.

MC: That’s right.
