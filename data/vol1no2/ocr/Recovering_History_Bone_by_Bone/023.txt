life and I became obsessed. So, this winter, I have to go to Butterfly World to see or
get a book and find this green variety. I always feel closer to heaven when I see these
butterflies. When I saw them in low places, butterflies are like moths. They are not

attractive.
(LAUGHTER)

So, I always associate them with going higher and as a child I always knew I was
closer to home when I would see a butterfly. So I think they sort of stuck in my
head in that way.

MC: Did you live in the mountain?

ED: We would spend summers in the mountains. We lived in the city but it was always
a kind of journey and we would walk and walk and walk and we stayed overnight
with somebody half-way. So the whole idea of seeing them — they seemed to
belong to this other world. It’s similar to fireflies — if you could only see them for

longer
(LAUGHTER)
MC: Which is the beauty of the firefly. When you see them, it’s like a little miracle.

ED: Exactly. And that’s how I felt about these butterflies. That they were like little mir-
acles. And this time I saw these green ones and I thought, “Of course, maybe they’re
blending into the trees.” Unless they fly, you don’t see them. They’re so green,
they're like the leaves. I've been afraid to do it, to look at a book that has a very

careful study of butterflies because I feel that’s going to kill the mystery for me.
(LAUGHTER)

But I think, for me, they’re associated with high places. Maybe they’re small

manifestations of angels.

MC: | believe that. I think they’re like spirits on earth. Well, just the image that you've

used, closer to heaven. It’s like they’re a piece of heaven on earth.
ED: Exactly.

MC; It can make the most desolate place seem quite beautiful.
