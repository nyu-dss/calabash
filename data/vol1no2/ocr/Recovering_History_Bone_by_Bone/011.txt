get the apology, to speak English, or to speak French, that whole thing. I think there
are many cases where judgments are immediately made based on how someone
appears — there I was with my braids, etc. We have to also, in some way, acknowl-
edge that people’s appearances will immediately box them in. I have friends who
will say that people assume that they’re this [or that] because of what they look like,
but it works both ways. So, even as we're looking at those things and we're saying

this of the DR, I think it’s also important to look at them in ourselves and see,

maybe, where we duplicate these things.

I think, as you were saying, Haiti is different in its racial mixing from a place like
Brazil, or the DR or Cuba. What I’ve really had to think about carefully is that the
Duvalier regime emerged out that whole “Noirisme” idea, to uplift the Black within
Haiti, and a lot of harm was created through that by Duvalier, in terms of the arms
he gave out, the kind of terrorism that occurred. This isn’t really a question but a
comment: I'm still wondering what kinds of repercussions we, as Haitians, whether
we're in Haiti or outside of Haiti, are suffering because of the psychological game
Duvalier played with color in order to be able to control as many people as he could
throughout the country. I think it does us harm not to examine the way we are both
anchored to the colonial heritage in terms of racism, but then also its distortion

within the Duvalier regime. You see what I mean?

Oh yes. And I think that at the same time, there are exceptions. It’s been said of Jean
[Dominique], for example, in spite of the things that were written after he died; I
don’t ascribe to that in his case because I think that if you ask the people he helped,
they would pause because it’s not the first thing they would remember about him.

Exactly.

But you're right. First the colonial legacy — was it something like seventy one cat-
egories of people — and sorting through all that. Also, what’s harder to get out of
is that there are times when color is linked with class and privilege. Here, you know,
Bill Bradley has talked about “white skin privilege”; maybe there are, on both sides
of the border, light-skinned privilege. I think also that we are further ahead than
other places at the same time. But, I think that if we are going to look over there
[DR], at other people, I think we also have to look at ourselves with these issues.
When I go to people in Haiti and then they immediately start judging, seeing [race]
in black and white, I say to them “Look at your own privilege. Do you [look at] any
