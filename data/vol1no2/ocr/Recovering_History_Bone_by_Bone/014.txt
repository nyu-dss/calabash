their lives. And when I was writing for the New York Times editorial journal, I kept
thinking of Duvalier selling those people for money. It’s not simple. It doesn’t serve
what we're talking about, it doesn’t serve the issue not to look at the complexities
of it. For me, our role in it is always the one thing we have control over on our end.
That's the one thing that if we collectively were willing to stop, we could stop; we
could more affect what we're doing rather than what other people are doing. That’s

where the idea of judgment for me comes in.
MC: We'te only the masters of ourselves, in the end.

ED: Exactly. We can’t talk about this massacre without looking at our role, what role we
played in this thing. People would not leave in the first place if their situation was-
n't so bad and that’s one idea. That’s one path to travel. Second, definitely, at that
time, or in that period — General Compere Soleil, the Alexis’ book, I think talks
about this very well — the US Occupation of that time and the sort of larger forces,
which in some way could have unified both sides of the island under this occupy-
ing force for nineteen years. The Haitian side had it longer but I just think it’s
important to look at the larger picture. It was hard to pass judgment in the case of
this story because I kept finding nuances. For example, even today you can find
nuances in that every time they deport a truckful of people, there are always a cou-
ple of black Dominicans. Even today. There are people who are like your family,
like families of friends I have. It’s not always black and white. So, for me the best
way around that judgement is to try to understand the nuances in the issue and that,
you know, as they say, when you point a finger, you have four other ones looking

back at you.

MMC: That’s a great expression! I also notice that throughout your work you have great
respect for your characters. I know that with some of the stories that they’re based
on people you've met or stories you've been told. Clearly, you wouldn’t have been
able to meet people of this particular time-period. But I wonder if you crossed the
border, in the Dajab-n area, maybe the first time you went there if you had a feel-
ing of being in touch with the spirits of the place, of the land? Because your char-
acters speak a great deal about the land and the novel enters into the complexity of
that relationship. The title itself comes from a line where you write, “cane life, travay

té pou zo, the farming of bones.” It’s as if the people, the braceros [cane
