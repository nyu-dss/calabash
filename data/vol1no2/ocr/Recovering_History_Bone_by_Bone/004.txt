ED: Well, a friend of mine, Patrick Sylvain, a poet, was saying once that Haitians have
not had a good, long cry because there’s no time. It’s just a moving on to the next
battle. Ever since 1804, we're going on to the next fight. We’re always going on to
the next fight. And perhaps it’s that, | think, Haitians who leave Haiti earn the lux-
ury of being able to look back and cry on some level. Just being in Haiti — every-
thing is a struggle: driving, lights, electricity, phone, everything. Everyone is so
wrapped up in the daily struggles, both small and large ones, that I think that now
the next thing are the elections and you're always moving on to the next thing. So,
when I think of Jean [Dominique] for example, I always think my God. When he
was in exile, I worked with him here and part of my introduction to the anthology
[The Butterfly's Way] is about him. He was here and we used to talk about the peo-
ple who were being killed. And now, to have his name added to that...

MC: ...to that list.

ED: He's the first of these people that I knew personally and I think the great fear that
you have is that this is going to be just another name added to a list and that peo-
ple are going to just forget and [get] used to things like that. I think maybe, that
from here, from the other side, it is an extraordinary luxury but maybe that’s why
Haitians spend hours and hours discussing the situation even though they're not liv-
ing in it, because they have the luxury of distance, to pause while people who are
still there are dealing with it so much. But, these monuments, I think that even the
ones we have aren't cared for as they should be. I’ve had this experience, you know,
when you're just driving by any road and there’s one wall and someone will say this
is from the time of “la colonie” and it’s just a wall and you think, it looks like this
thing that’s out of place in a rice field, it looks old, but you don’t know what it is.
Even the Citadel — I'm told that there are sometimes Dominican buses that come
and they never tell people they’re in Haiti. Or people go to Labadie* and they never
tell people they’re in Haiti. I have friends who have gone on cruises and they say,

“They told us it was an island.”

MC: That's right. It’s one of the new stops apparently now. I had an acquaintance who
went on a cruise and went to Labadie and came back saying “I went to Haiti. I saw
Haiti.” But she never [went] any further than whatever beach they were dropped on.
That contributes to the lack of memory.
