Black people in America when you talk about the colorism here and so forth.” So,
I think we need to do the same, practice some kind of auto-critique at the same

time as we look at what has been going on in these other places.
MC: It’s an on-going challenge, I suppose.

ED: Oh yes. For me, writing about the twins, I think it starts with children. What's most
interesting in that relationship is the fact that they are twins and not-twins. And, it’s
common in the literature — how sometimes the blood surprises you. Even in
Amabelle’s case, for example, even if the [Dominican] father had stayed back in
Spain — you can go back with the Spaniards to the Moors. You can’t live in these
places and think you're pure blood. I think that’s what was so ridiculous about
Trujillo’s notion of the purity of blood.

MC: That’s right. He himself wasn’t pure.

ED: That's the idea of his wearing the powder, make-up, and so forth, and hiding his
own grandmother in his closet. It occurs over and over in Caribbean and colonial
literature and it occurs because it is true that this child was sort of a surprise, a man-

ifestation of something even in the husband's past.

MC; it was interesting that you made sure to say that she looked like her father so that
it was clear which is not like in other stories I was thinking about written in the
1800s in America, usually by white writers, but also in Britain, where the child was
always a surprise because there had been an infidelity of some sort. In this case, it
was very clear that you were saying this about how these communities are inter-

linked, going back to Spain, but also within the island.

ED: Oh yes. I read so many of the biographies of Trujillo that he commissioned where
he literally re-wrote his history, You can’t re-write that history. You can only re-write

it to a point especially when the child shows up. That’s inevitable.

MC: The other thing I was wondering about in relationship to the epigraph from Judges
was the overall tone of the novel. And also the fact that Amabelle has her own ded-
ication which is something I haven’t seen before — the narrator actually gets to
dedicate the novel as opposed to you dedicating the novel to Metrés Dlo — which
I thought was very nice and which is also interesting to me because of what you

were saying earlier about Haitians not crying a great deal. There are so many pas-
