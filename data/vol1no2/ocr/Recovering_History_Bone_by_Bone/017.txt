listened closely when I went to the woman's house to see if people would ask,
“Why?” It came up and one of her daughters said, “Well, we want to be able to visit
her grave.” It occurred to me that it wasn’t that they were going now to go every
year and have a mass as others had done and that’s when I knew, that at least for
this group of people, the shift had occurred. I think it’s the same for Joel’s father
and it’s a heart-breaking realization, maybe, that perhaps we bury our dead where

we are. Maybe while we're doing it, we're realizing, “Oh, maybe we're not going
back.”

Before, you spoke about the privilege of being outside of Haiti, and being able to
look back. Do you find that there is also a kind of difficulty in being outside of
Haiti and looking back, especially for you as a writer?

Well, I think then you enter that authenticity debate that you encounter in every
group where you have migrancy, the inside/outside debate. My answer to that is
that I think everybody has their own Haiti. If there even was a point in doing the
anthology, a mission, for me that’s one thing that I wanted, for all those people who
were hounding me, especially all those people who want you to represent them in

their unique way....
Their Haiti.
(LAUGHTER)

Yes. In this anthology, there are rich people; there are poor people. And there are all
these different experiences and sometimes people will say the exact opposite of
what some others would say and that excited me quite a lot. Yes, everybody has their

own Haiti and that goes even beyond the questions of class and gender.
It’s how one remembers even.

Yes, exactly. But I think sometimes that younger people are afraid of that because
they can be easily silenced. People will say to them: “Ohoh, Sa ou konin? Ou pat
la. Ou se oun ti moun.” There is this whole generation, this whole group of people
who are conflicted. Sometimes Haitian people are nicer to the white people who
write about Haiti than the Haitians, or Haitian Americans if they’re young. Maybe
this is in Haiti's advantage that everybody thinks their love is more than the next

person’s.
