this wasn’t the case with this one. But, I think awards in general are very nice but
what happens as a result and everything that has happened for this book, I felt so
glad if one more person heard about this subject. The subject matter of The Farming
of Bones was very important to me because, as I kept stressing to people, it’s not
something that's over. When you talk about history, there are things [within it] that
hurt but if you feel that you are honoring some kind of past pain, it’s different than
staring at a wound every day, which this is still. It’s not something that we've buried
and put behind us, as Haitians or as Dominicans. It’s something that people are still
living everyday. Just like the other day, there were all these people being shot at the
border or, every other day, you hear about some people being deported and the
truck turns over, and the bateys there still exist. It’s living memory. It’s a war still.
Anyone who says to me, “I've heard about your book, and I never heard about this
and I went and got another book,” to me that is the most interesting part of the
project because there is no memorial to these people who died, except this horrible,
living pain. So, at least people learn about it and are informed about it. And that’s
important.

Actually, when you were talking about the idea of living memory or the lack of
memorial, I was thinking about my trip to Cuba. When I went to Santiago, I visited
the Moncada [Barracks], which is the fort that the revolutionaries had stormed in, I
believe it was in 1956, when the Revolution was not yet successful, and the
Moncada has been turned into a school. Half of it is a school and half of it is a
museum and the side of it that’s a museum shows you what the rebels tried to do,
how they were defeated, and there’s a torture chamber that’s been kept. There's a
room that actually shows you the implements of torture, how they were used, and
where the bodies were lying of those who had been killed. So, it’s quite paradoxi-
cal that there is that memorial and then there are these children. On one level, on a
spiritual level, I wondered what this might do ... going to school so close to the
spirit of the dead but, at the same time, it made me think of Haiti and places where
people were tortured, under the Duvalier regime and how we don’t have those
memorials yet. And it made me think about the fact that we don't have them yet
because there is still, as you're saying, an on-going persecution of Haitians, whether
it’s across the border or within Haiti. So, that lack of memorial — it seems that the
text that you produced, that others have produced, are so important so that we don’t
forget the history. They have to be markers for on-going battles. Right?
