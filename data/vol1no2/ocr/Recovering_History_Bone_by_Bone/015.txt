cutters/field hands] especially, are working the land, but they’re working death.
And so, this is connected to giving the narrator her own dedication and to what
you're saying about understanding. You want to understand your characters and you

give them that respect and that leads your readers to have that same respect as well.

I think growing up with poor people in Haiti, you realize the duality of their lives.
And even going to the mountains this time with a friend of mine, I’m always so
aware when I go way in to the countryside in Haiti how much poor people are
marooned in some way. Still. I think for me that was always at the front of my con-
sciousness. I always viewed how people had to belittle themselves, people who were
kind of giants in their house. Or when people came to the United States and they
have to take their child to the doctor or the child has to take them to the doctor
because they don’t have language. For me, the kind of people I write about, I always
wanted to at least try to speak of them intimately. First of all, when people are poor
or when they serve other people they're almost assumed to be invisible. The idea of
Amabelle as the servant to me was very important. Her working in the house was a
very powerful idea for me. And that’s why I decided to write those little sections
where it’s just her thoughts, her remembering, her memory. Because it would just
contrast the silence that is forced on people who work for others. There are
moments when she speaks about working for others, the duality you have to have
— you have to be invisible but always be close by for them to call on you. People
assume that people who serve don’t have an interior life, that they don’t have laugh-
ter, or people assume that they know nothing but this side that they show. I was
talking to someone about this, to Renald Roméus, the painter, and we were saying
that sometimes people have to be in the presence of other people, marrooned. You
have to smile, to giggle, but sometimes you have to hide your intelligence if you're
serving people.

I did want to hand over this text to Amabelle because I felt it was her story and
her story in the way of testimony, similar to The Diary of Anne Frank, a story like
that. I was always most compelled to understand larger events by reading one nar-
rative. For example, with Anne Frank, she’s in this enclosed space all the time, and
you're receiving this interior life. In the sections about Amabelle’s interior life, I
thought of her relationship with the people and their relationship to the land and
also people’s attempt to return to that land.

You have this too with immigration in that when people migrated they sold their
