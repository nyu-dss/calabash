own little piece of land to go work other people's piece of land in the DR. The
land goes from being their partner, their friend, almost their lover, like in
[Roumain’s] The Masters of the Dew, to becoming an enemy. That's when the whole
idea of “travay té pou zo” becomes working the land to die or to grow bones. The
whole idea of burial for the old man — the idea of having to bury his son in this
hostile land is very hard to take that he can’t even share it with the community. He
can't let himself be comforted because of this idea that he’s putting his son in the
ground, there, in this hostile land. Marquez, in One Hundred Years of Solitude, said
that you don’t really belong to a place until you've buried your dead there. And the
idea of still belonging after that. You have the sense that for Joel’s father, he’s not
going to leave ever because his son is now part of this place. So, I think the rela-
tionship to the land is transformed. Your respect for the land is not the same because,
as my father always said, you lose everything if you don’t even own the ground

under your feet.

MC: The idea of dislocation makes me think about how migration has shifted so much
for Haitians, away from France and Canada to the United States since the seventies,
and this whole idea of burying the dead. I think about it in a personal way because
L used to think of myself as an exile and now I think of myself as dislocated, dis-
placed. I’m not sure how to ask this question but there’s a way, I think, that a lot of
Haitians who are outside of Haiti, and those within, are haunted by these kinds of
things — the massacres, the terrorism under the Duvalier regime, the army in the
early nineties, the kind of instability that’s going on now. Where do we bury the

dead, or do we bury our memory? I don’t know how to ask that in a simpler way.

ED: {had a moment once where I realized that this whole group of Haitians belonged
here. I used to live in a building on Flatbush Avenue [Brooklyn, NY] when I just
arrived here; that’s where my parents were; and there were all these Haitians who
lived there. For the first period, maybe the first ten years, whenever somebody died,
they would send their body to Haiti — routine — no doubt about it. They would
have a service here like a wake and there was even one house that people used who
had a relationship with a house in Haiti, a funeral home. You always knew they
would go back until one day something like five years ago, this one woman died
while she was on vacation in Haiti and they shipped her body back to New York.
And I thought, my God, things have really shifted for this small group of maybe
forty people who had lived in the building. I couldn’t ask for an explanation but I
