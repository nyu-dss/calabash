Tough Act

My father drove around

in a vintage Ford â€”

We called him Henry

(the car that is).

So dashing with his

sleek black running boards,
sporty canvas top that

went up or stayed down

and a challenging crank-up start.

I loved Henry.

I chose relationships
with a sense of doom
from the start

and each time believed

it was everlasting love

while endlessly

driving myself into the ground.
Such a let down after Henry.
