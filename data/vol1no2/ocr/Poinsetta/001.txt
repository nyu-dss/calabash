Opal Palmer Adisa

Ke

Poinsetta

Red was always a fickle color
But who cared when the flamboyant tree
Screamed off its head

Or your mother didn’t speak to you
Because she was mad

And the words you needed

To speak ran off and left you

Red could be capricious all she wants

That didn’t alter the beauty of the Hibiscus
Or made them any less useful for

Shining your shoes

Red was the jeer of strange men
Who made your feet want to stumble
Or the membrane that is removed
From ackee before its cooked

Dangerous or bold

As women sitting legs spread
Using their shirts to fan the heat
Between their thighs

Or the fish bone

Caught in your throat

The sun

Just before it dropped

Behind the mountain

Or the laughter that

Nudged you from the chair

Until your stomach was in stitches

Peppered shrimp
Soliciting water from your eyes
Red is that mean sometimes
