factor in defining the realities and the problems of the contemporary life of Haitians.

The art of Edouard Duval-Carrié is deeply rooted in this notion of migration, change, re-
invention and transformation. The vicissitudes of Haitian society and its shifts of personality and
values are integral to his vision of the world he inhabits. The artist himself is an embodiment of
alteration and transmutation. As a Haitian who has lived and studied in France and Canada and who
now resides in the United States (Miami), he is acutely aware of the disorientations caused by
migration. Duval-Carrié is also conscious of the necessity of possibilities inherent in physical and
spiritual journeys. His work reflects a continual rumination on metamorphosis and its consequences.
In his paintings he deals with these themes in an allegorical form. The travels of the /yas, the spiritual
essences of voodoo, are the principal subjects of his recent images. In some of these paintings, such
as Migrations des Betes ot Dambalah Di, Duval-Carrié addresses this theme directly, while in others the
fluid movements of the spirits are more broadly suggested.

In many ways the journey of the spirits across both time and cultures, may be understood as a
metaphor for the peripatetic existence of the artist himself. His affirmation of the vitality of voodoo,
as both a religion and a way of life inside and outside of Haiti, is a testimony to one of the most
intimate and innate characteristics of himself as well as the culture from which he emerged. Voodoo,
a teligion of West African origin into which Christian elements (saints, symbols and ritual) are
interpolated, does not have a written theology. It is a religion which has developed organically,
shaping itself to the needs of the faithful and their circumstances. Voodoo is not a religion of the
word but, rather, one of images which have evolved over many generations. The visual language of
voodoo is both concrete and abstract. The individual spirits made the sea journey from the lands of
the Fon, Yoruba and Ewe peoples in the lands around the Gulf of Benin with the slaves transported
to the New World. They came to the Antilles as well as to Brazil and were embraced with similar
but varying names and attributes in islands such as Cuba, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, Santeria shares
these deities as well as many of Voodoo’s ritual practices. While santeria is extremely important in
the Spanish-speaking nations among a wide cross section of the population, Haitian voodoo is,
perhaps, more pervasive within the totality of the various social strata of the nation. In Haiti voodoo
developed in a particularly tenacious way after independence from France was achieved and the
French Catholic clergy departed.

Edouard Duval-Carrié's art acknowledges and affirms the steadfastness of the religion and its
pervasive qualities, yet his paintings are by no means religious icons. The artist deals with the
essential personalities of voodoo (Erzulie Freda, Erzulie Dantor, Dambala, Baron Samedi, Gédé and
others) as inevitable presences within the landscape — both visual and mental — of Haiti. In a
manner that has been described as “post modern” Duval-Carrié appropriates these /yas, yet he does
not change their personalities and does not reconstruct their connotations. He employs the figures
of these deities as symbols of self realization and cultural affirmation. In his depictions of
