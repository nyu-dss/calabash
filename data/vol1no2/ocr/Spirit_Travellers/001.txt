Spirit Travellers’

PAINTING EDQOUARD DUVAL-CARRIE

HE SUBJECT OF MIGRATION IS CENTRAL TO THE DISCOURSE OF MODERN AND
T contemporary art of the Caribbean. The spiritual and aesthetic basis of the cultural expressions
of the nations of this part of the world revolve around both forced and voluntary migration. Exile
and expatriation have found their way into concrete visual terms. The terrors of the Middle Passage,
the journey of the enslaved from Africa to the Caribbean, and the resulting trauma of bondage and
servitude remain the central defining issue in the history of the islands. In contemporary art migra-
tion takes on many appearances. In Cuban art of the 1960s and 70s, for example, the theme of
migration as exile has been fundamental to many artists. Luis Cruz Azaceta and Ana Mendieta,
among others, expressed the trauma of obligatory banishment and cultural transplantation. Exile and
the consequences of re-location again became significant in work by Cuban artists in exile in the
United states after the Mariel crisis of the early 1980s. More recent Cuban art of the 1990s has
focused once again upon this dilemma. Artists both living on the island and working abroad have
employed the image of the boat or the raft as a symbol of societal instability causing the need for
re-location and accommodation to unfamiliar and, at times, alien circumstances.

Cuban artists are not the ones to use the metaphor of travel and migration. Dominican artists have
also depicted the water, rafts and boats in their art to denote the equally tragic circumstances of the
thousands who flee the island for both reasons of economic privation and societal coercions. In
Puerto Rican art of the 1980s and the 1990s the symbol of the airplane as opposed to sea-going
vessels is employed. The “air bridge” between San Juan and New York links the two islands in both
tangible and spiritual ways. Jamaican artists have also dealt with the subject of split identities
(including migration between the island and England) to question the essential qualities of
Caribbean identity. Haiti is a nation for which migration and exile have played key roles in the
formation of a contemporary consciousness. The social upheavals of the 1990s are only the most
recent circumstances that have occasioned massive retreat from the island. Haitian-ness, Haitian
identity and Haitian cultural personality are by no means involved solely with life on the island itself;
the complexities of the country’s personality have extended far beyond its political borders. The
constant flow back and forth between Port-au-Prince and Brooklyn, Paris or Montreal is an essential
