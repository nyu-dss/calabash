migrations he describes not only the mythical journeys of the spirits from Africa to the Caribbean
but suggests their pervasiveness in every site of the Haitian diaspora.

In the new paintings Duval-Carrié appropriates many formal qualities of the visual vocabulary of
voodoo, Some of these paintings combine semi-abstract, pattern-like forms ultimately derived from
the traditional vévé, a pattern drawn on the ground during voodoo ceremonies with flour or coffee
grounds which invokes the presence of the spirit or spirits. In addition, Duval-Carrié also forges his
own critique of the Haitian “naif” tradition. The most well known form of “modern” Haitian
painting developed in the 1940s with the work of painters such as Hector Hippolyte, Seneque Obin,
Rigaud Benoit and others. These artists were reacting against an already established current of
European- based modernism in Haitian art that had emerged earlier. The early “naifs” (as well as the
hundreds of others of varying levels of accomplishment who have continued this tradition into the
present) established a “voice” for Haitian art that was accepted with alacrity throughout the Americas
and Europe. Duval-Carrié’s work represents an appropriation and a critique of this mode of artistic
vision.

Duval-Carrié has always invested his art with a degree of irony and, often, an acerbic social
criticism. Some of his well-known pieces, for example, comment upon the lamentable socio-political
injustices under the Duvalier regime. These pictures administer a caution to every viewer, with their
powerful visual metaphors, to carefully consider the essential qualities of Haitian existence and, by
extension, of the human condition. These paintings accomplish this goal by means of a high degree
of imagination and inventiveness within the framework of a resplendent palette, thought-provoking

imagery and evocative depictions of the pervasive spirits of voodoo.
