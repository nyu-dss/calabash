with a strong sense of and responsibility to community. Mine was never the luxury of selfish pursuit.
My mother drummed into my head, and by her own example, made clear that whatever path I took,
whatever career I chose, I had an inextricable responsibility to my Caribbean community, and that I
had to give something back, no matter how small. I was told, if not implicitly, that 1 was expected
to work in service of this community and to do less would be to earn the shameful label of being
wuklis! Perhaps because this was so much a part of my upbringing, I don’t even think about
presenting a community voice in my work, but it is always present because I am always connected
to the circle. Yet, | vehemently oppose prescribing to a writer, (any artist for that matter) or dictating
that an artist's work support the cause or revolution, whatever that might look like. However, because
of the precarious position of the Caribbean and Africa, because of the insidious nature of the
hegemony, cultural imperialism and capitalist greed, as a writer with deep spiritual and ancestral ties
to these geographic locations, I would be remiss if I do not in some way address these issues in my
work. I would indeed be “wuklis” if my writing does not tackle or interrogate these issues which
have devastated our economies, are rapidly altering our way of life and are creating environmental
warfare that will ruin our ecological system and destroy the intrinsic beauty of our region.

As a Caribbean woman writer and mother of three children, I must address these issues in my
work. I must write in service or in behalf of the community for the simple fact that I have access
and I can, whereas many others can’t. But I will not write in support of any one party or engage in
myopic party politics. I will not use my writing to promote an opportunist or glorify anyone or any
condition that attempts to swindle or cheat my people out of their inheritance. I will use my writing
to severely criticize those, including my fellow countrywoman and man, who are not working in our
best interest. I will use my writing to revive cultural vehicles that I believe to be sustaining and
nurturing. I will use my writing to point out our provincialism, our homophobia, our Christian
biases, our self-hatred, our colorism, our classism, our many prejudices and divisive ideologies that
keep us from progressing as a people and as a world community. I will write to shame us into
honoring all of us. I will write to expose those things that we have done to each other to keep each
other down. I will use my writing to disclose the tremendous child abuse, misogyny, and wanton
unruliness and decline in basic humanity that are destroying our society. I will write to celebrate our
tenacity, our generosity of spirit, our marvelous laughter, our bodacious style, our pious grace, quiet
humility and our magnanimous humanity. I will write to appeal to my sisters and brothers in South
America, Latin America, North America, and Africa to come together and work cooperatively. I will
write to call on my people throughout the diaspora to become a united force. I will write and let us
revisit the idea of Federation. Let's revisit the Pan-African conference. Let's examine the words that
we speak and make sure we are in agreement with the meaning of the words that we utter. Let’s
listen to each other and learn from each other my sisters and brothers throughout the diaspora. Come

and let’s sit down and break bread in space, with compassion, with the goal of implementing
