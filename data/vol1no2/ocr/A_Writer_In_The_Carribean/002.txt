that mumble and grumble in your head is to raise the cry of:

Is mad, she mad!

Wha do her mek she always want to be alone?

Duppy must a talk to her!

Is foolishness pack up she head! She tink she betta than we!

How then to continue to create in such a space, to write about a people who scoff you at every
move, who view you as an insane person, or condemn you as a pariah. Yet this is often the condition
under which the Caribbean writer, and perhaps even the African writer creates, writing on behalf
and in support of her or his people who often do not regard what the writer does as work.

I have come to accept this condition, knowing that when I emerge, ready to f√©te again, ready to
hang out again, that I will be welcomed, patted on the back and even gain grudging admiration for
insisting on this time to myself in order to create and speak on behalf of fi me people. Paradoxically,
although I need the space and time alone, I am never alone when writing. Most times my full
attention and subjects are of the very people who begrudge me the space. As a Caribbean writer my
material are the people, the neo-colonial condition of our existence and trying to fashion for us, but

mostly for myself, another reality, another way of being in the world.
