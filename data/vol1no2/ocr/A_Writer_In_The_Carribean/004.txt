changes that will benefit all of us, or at least the majority of us. Yes! I will use my writing in service
of my community because that is how I was reared and because my group needs me and others like
me to speak for them, to create spaces to bring our voices and concerns to the world at large. My
community needs to remind the world that we exist, not as a paradise, a place to escape, bask in the
sun and forget about daily concerns, but a place that came into existence struggling, fighting for
sovereignty and a right to fashion its own identity,

I am a Caribbean writer and mother of three who wants to ensure that long after I have passed
into another life there will still be an independent place known as the Caribbean that my children
and their children to the tenth generation can call home and will be safe, free and nourished by this
place. This should also be the goal of all writers and artists, but especially those writers of Caribbean
and African ancestry. The community, I have discovered, is not there to thwart the writer's goals, but
rather, to ensure that we do not speak a language that obfuscates, demeans, or shrouds our children
in victimization. The community is not unwilling to grant us space to acknowledge our work. Often

they are generous and congratulatory of us as we are to them.

I, the writer, am still writing, not always isolated or locked away from the noise and the drama of
Caribbean life. Sometimes I am there in the midst, whether sitting at a bus stop, eating at a restaurant,
driving down the street, or shopping in the market. I am arrested by an action, a gesture, a smile, a
tone of voice that demands that I capture and interpret what I see. I, the writer, remove myself from
the community at times, but it always welcomes me back because it knows I write out of love, respect
and urgency to share our stories.
