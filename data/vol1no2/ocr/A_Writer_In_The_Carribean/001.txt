A Writer in the Caribbean

I the writer, sit in my office shut off from the outside world, determined to seal out all noise, even
y my children.

I need silence to hear my thoughts. I do not want anything or anyone to intrude on this time or
in this space. I make sure to turn off the telephone. I close the door to my office. I must be alone. I

need space and quiet to think, to write. I am a writer and I work in solitude. Any and all interruptions
are met with vexation.

why must there always be a carnival
of noise and soiree

that’s why there is so much confusion
in this space

everyday bacchanal

and feting up and down the place

oonuh shut up

don’t oonuh know

what me is

me is writer

me writing oonuh life stories

and all oonuh can do is chat up de place
and make noise from rooster crow
until owl open its eyes

oonuh shut up, man

me is a writer

writing big stories

As a Caribbean writer, I know all too well the challenges of creating a secure, tranquil space to
write in a community where privacy is viewed with suspicion and one is expected to be social, liming
with friends, and almost always be in clique with others. To want to be by oneself, to go walking

alone in the company of one’s mind, to seclude oneself ftom people just so you can hear the voices
