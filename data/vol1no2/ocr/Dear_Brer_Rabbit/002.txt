124 / Winston Farrell

Calabash

Lost food stamps, welfare flat, cross lines to trouble
Rabbit, friend, lend me an ear for a sad tale
Anancy in a goal, send bail-money double

Why should a man want leave islan’ gems
To hop hollywood streets like a hermit
Broken dreams are cold distortions bleedin’ stems.

Tradin’ diamond finger nails for cowboy boots?
Your warm cut of sunlight a dyin’ memory
How can man grow when snow cement black roots.

From one jungle to another ... ps.
Yours sincerely, please send u.s.
