Keeping dreams

we landed on your shores

not to steal, scorn, rape

we did not arrive sardine-tight, tear full
dehydrated cargoes

on fishing boats

though some came by treacherous
means, their deeds spilling trickery

we arrived

without shackles

but we've tripped over death
ruthless politicians just the same

we did not come in greed

rather with hands

opened wide to a dream

we came because we were as good
as any to carry the baton

or win the gold

we listened when told

we wete deserving

back home black was never mentioned
there was no reason for distinction

we came because we were paid for,
whereas there are no payment for blood
we might have given you our hidden pains
but that was to make us better
