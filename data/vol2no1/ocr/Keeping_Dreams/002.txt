Calabash

pride strong it was never our desire
to stand in your lines

or suck the life

from your over-burdened system

we became a punch line for comedians
about our many jobs held

hands always clasped tight in prayer

because our children, our children_s children
our parents, grandparents, a whole village
was hinging on our survival

we dream of telling them
you treated us well

that you afforded us a room
with a view of the future

we did not come to ravish
but sometimes we fall in love
and love demands all there is
giving everything it has
