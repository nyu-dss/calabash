Calabash

I let fly a few. He usually attributes these to his loneliness
and delirium; or to his mishearing. He prays
extra hard those nights.

‘Poor Robin Crusoe’, I mock him. ‘Where have you been?
How come you here?’ Poll, he claims loftily, the
only person permitted to talk to me.

His servant, indeed. When that other creature came, the one
called Friday, | almost left him (that one was
a quick study. Knew exactly how

to please). I stayed because being ‘Crusoe’s parrot’ does
give me status among the poor dumb creatures
in the trees. Now their teacher is me.

I had thought of peopling the island with
educated parrots and sweet airs. But I laid off the teaching
when I found I could no longer stand

their screeching. Since he arrived, my hearing is not what
it used to be. I find the senseless cries of those
uncivilized birds unbearable — as they find

talkative me. Once he goes, I'll have to find my place again
among my own, go back to playing dumb, Knowing
I cannot stave off the yearning

that will master me for words addictive as grain cracked
open on the tongue. Ashamed, alone again,
I'll start to haunt the beach, waiting for

another to come along, to give me speech.
