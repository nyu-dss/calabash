Yemaya

Not a blond fish-girl who coos at sailors
but a burnt umber skinned creature

flint nipples like black pearls

thalo blue tail that thrashes

like a tongue, muscles her a coarse
across blabbering waves.

Sailors pray as she claws

up the stern, tips the ship

from the weight of her forty foot fin.

I didn’t know who I was praying to —

the candle I bought at the Santeria bodega —

all the poems I couldn’t write —

I didn’t know she would surge up, black waters

cold on her breath, black waters in tears

like welts down her throat and sternum

her hair, briny dreads

the ocean surface, a gape of suction

as she pulled her salt wind limbs into full amphibious nature
dragging the oxygen out from my lungs —

I swam like hell, held her down

beneath my belly’s shore line

but foam cusped at my heels in the supermarket,

waves licked up sidewalks, seaweed sprouted out ceiling tiles at the office
and she spat, hissed

a constant froth at my own lips.

The bathroom sink, green with morning,

I began to cough up shells, bits of iridescent scales —

she had me from the inside, Lady of the Undertow,
