Calabash

When the nutmeg flowered
Ma used it to flavor cocoa
she grew on the down
beaten to dust

in hard wood-brown mortar,
drunk each morning

with fresh cow’s milk.

How we'd come rolling from the up,
that rich green grass,
thickest in the world, Pa,
greenest too,
Ma chasing us around the house with a whip,
grass stains being the hardest to get out.

Now I stand in the old, abandoned house,
shout your name to the blue mountains —

Not even an echo returns.
