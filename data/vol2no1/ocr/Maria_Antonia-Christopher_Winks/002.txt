run, it vanished from the stage during the many years of intellectual repression in Cuba touched off
by the arrest, jailing, and staged “confession” of the poet Heberto Padilla in 1971, and was not
published until 1979.

Eugenio Hernandez himself continued to write during that grim period, winning the Casa de las
Américas prize in 1977 for his (unproduced) play La Simona. In the gradual (and relative) post-1980
thaw in Cuban intellectual life, his plays have for the most part returned to public performance on
the island (Maria Antonia, for instance, was revived in the mid-1980s by the Teatro Irrumpe of
Santiago, under the aegis of its original director, Roberto Blanco, himself a victim during the 1970s
of the Cuban government's anti-homosexual campaign). In 1989, a (far-from-complete) edition of
his collected works was published by Letras Cubanas. Hernandez Espinosa is now the director of
Havana's Teatro Caribefio, and his plays, many of which center on dramatic retellings from the trea-
sury of Afro-Cuban mythology, are frequently presented both in Cuba and abroad.

Maria Antonia reflects Hernandez Espinosa’s own experiences growing up in the 1940s and 1950s
amidst the rich popular culture that flourished in the Havana working-class, multi-racial barrio of El
Cerro, with its rumberos like the legendary Cheo Malanga and Manolo El Aguajista (immortalized
in a guaracha and in a Hernandez Espinosa play as “Mi socio Manolo” [My Buddy Manolo]) and its
public Santeria ceremonies (called “gziemilere,” from a Yoruba term that literally translates as “to take
part in the convulsions of the house of images”). But instead of resorting in his drama to the tried-
and-true conventions of Cuban costumbrismo, wherein popular traditions were presented as merely
colorful and folkloric, or to the customary stage depictions of Afto-Cubans borrowed from the
comic stereotypes of the 19th-century teatro bufo, Hernandez Espinosa brilliantly theatricalizes the
poverty, violence, and racism that underpin the daily dramas of the street. (See the first, quasi-cine-
matic sequence of the scene translated here.) Moreover, photographs of Roberto Blanco’s stage
production indicate a stark, almost Brechtian ambiance — a far cry from the “local color” purveyed
by conventional realism.

Against this backdrop, the tragic heroine Maria Antonia fights to create an individual space for
herself where her desires and dreams can be fulfilled against the predominant machismo. As a
personage, she is both part of a long line of Cuban heroines — who include Maria Belén Chacon,
the rumbera of Emilio Ballagas’s famous poem, Maria la O, the tragic-mulata protagonist of Ernesto
Lecuona’s zarzuela, and the immortal Cecilia Valdés, the eponymous mulata heroine of Cirilo
Villaverde's great rgth-century “novel of Cuban customs” — and a break with that tradition, insofar
as she is Black and is thus fully aware that, under the dominant color-complex that prizes light skin,
even the possibility of social mobility is denied her. (It is worth noting that the original Maria
Antonia, Hilda Oates, is a dark-skinned actress who was in her forties at the time of the premiere.)
In her magnificent yet ultimately self-destructive rebellion against not only the social order but
against the orishas themselves and their earthly representatives in the form of the Godmother and the
