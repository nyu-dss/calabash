Calabash

babalawo Batabio, Maria Antonia finds herself incapable of overcoming the power of her obsessive
love for the aspiring boxer Julian, and by extension the destiny marked out for her by her santo, the
love-goddess Oshtn.

Hernandez Espinosa’s text is written in a vividly colloquial language that, instead of having
recourse to facile dialectal representations or picturesque grammatical constructions, presents the
speech of the barrio in all its poetry, by turns harsh and elegant. Since Salkey mentions the “star-
tling crudeness of the Afro-Cuban Spanish dialect” (144), it can be assumed that in performance, the
actors-singers-dancers inflected the script with their own “nation-language.” The same practice could
well be applied to future English-language stagings, which depending on their locations could be
adapted according to the local nation-languages (Jamaican, Trinidadian, Black American). In my
translation of the scene included here (which I hope to follow with a version of the entire play), I
have tried to convey some of the flavor of the text, unavoidably North-Americanizing it, but not, it
is hoped, to detrimental effect.
