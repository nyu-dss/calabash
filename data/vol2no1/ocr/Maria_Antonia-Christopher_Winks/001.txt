Maria Antonia

EUGENIO HERNANDEZ ESPINOSA

RITTEN IN 1965 AND FIRST STAGED IN 1967, EUGENIO HERNANDEZ
W Espinosa’s Maria Antonia has become a classic of modern Cuban drama, a status furthered
by Sergio Giral’s excellent 1990 film adaptation, now available on video. At the time of its premiere,
however, this play aroused a great deal of controversy among the cultural authorities of post-revo-
lutionary Cuba. Not only did it refuse an explicitly political orientation, it staged Afro-Cuban
drumming-singing-dancing rituals as fully-integrated dramatic elements instead of exoticized
sideshow entertainment. As well, its unadorned depiction of the privations of tenement life, while
set ostensibly in the late 1940s during the Republic, did not fail to call the public’s attention to the
persistence of poverty and racism in Cuba notwithstanding the de jure abolition of racial discrimi-
nation following Fidel Castro’s accession to power in 1959.

In his Havana Journal (Penguin, 1971), an impressionistic account of the 1968 Congreso Cultural
de La Habana, the Jamaican writer Andrew Salkey describes attending Maria Antonia during its
premiere run, in the company of C.L.R. James, Robert Hill, John LaRose, and their official govern-
ment minder. While Salkey hailed the performance as “[b]y far the finest acted, most exciting and
thought-provoking folk play I’ve ever seen” (143), his minder Marcos, depicted throughout the
journal as a sober, orthodox Communist, expressed discomfort: “...the violence in the story doesn’t
make any sense now. It’s destructive. It was then. It would be now” (144).

Behind Marcos’s unease lay an entire complex of “revolutionary” attitudes toward Afto-Cuban
culture that can be broadly summarized in terms of a disdain for its alleged backwardness and
dependence on outmoded (if not downright “primitive”) and potentially “reactionary” religious
expressions like Santeria or the Abakua secret society. At the time Maria Antonia was playing in
Havana, the most prominent revolutionary critic of this dogmatic (and ultimately racist) perspective,
Walterio Carbonell, who openly insisted on the progressive contributions of Afro-Cuban culture and
religion to the construction of a national consciousness (a viewpoint also reflected in Salkey’s remark
about Santeria as “the ghetto’s apolitical Black Power” [144]), had been marginalized and imprisoned.
And although Maria Antonia enjoyed huge popular success, with 20,000 people seeing it during its
