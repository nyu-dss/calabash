Tomatoes

“... in-your palm, the ripe weight.”
—L1-Young Lee

Daddy eats them in milk
says them like an English-
man his Pa sold them

put his ten through school
set aside English pride
like his best top hat

set up a roadside

stand for the love

apples softer rounder
stand for the cool

ripe weight

of fruit or vegetable

or whatever

is red or plump

and pleading.
