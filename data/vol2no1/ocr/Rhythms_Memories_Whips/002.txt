cat’s call for its lost young. Perhaps it was

an unconscious recalling of ancestral voices
on the auction block. We've tried dancing out
our memory, but the music lingered, tugged
and plucked notes on the umbilical cord.
Generations linked by rhythms.

My memory rode the music, scaling

jagged notes with whips-split-skins beats.

I remember the sound of drums fiercely beating
and the aroma of rum peppering night air

on Haitian hills of Leogane, where returnees

from the Dominican Republic's cane fields
celebrated their homecoming with freedom’s feast.
Men and women danced around a blazing campfire,
with arms scarred by sugar cane’s sword-like leaves.

Generations’ blood on the fields,

Marsalis tried reconnecting memories
through snappy riffs, jumpy and jagged lines,
voicing pain and the blues of a people bruised
on the road to freedom. Music bled memories
as we danced out our anger. Music is coping,
music is history and long gone generations
have clapped and stepped-out cruelties.

On the Caribbean mountains,

or the United States’ deep south,

past and present, toiling bodies sang
night-songs to lay down burdens

and strengthen dreams that one day

blistered feet will dance freedom’s feast

in a pantheon of reposed souls.
