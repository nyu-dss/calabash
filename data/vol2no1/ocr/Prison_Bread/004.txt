vidually folded them into neat triangles. I would learn that this was the fold for unbaked croissants.

After that day by the river, she would seek me out whenever I was alone. I would be walking to
the shop alone at night to get some gripe medicine for the baby, and she would appear beside me,
and keep my company as we walked by the churchyard with its harmless dead and the dark corners
with the living devils. I would be working in the field reaping crops for pay or tending our kitchen
garden or picking up rat gut from the coffee fields, and she would be there. Quick and efficient, she
taught me much about getting through unpleasant work. So silent was she at first that many times I
would imagine she still lived in my head, but then we would begin to talk and she was real. In the
beginning we would share simple exchanges about the day and the heat and the breeze and the rain
and the size of the mangos and the need for rain and the sweetness of the apples. We never spoke
about ourselves, at least not personal things, but our bond grew strong.

One day my old guardian drove to the house. She had come to speak to my mother. Without
thought I crept into a secret place to listen to the conversation. Our house was low to the ground,
and so I sat on the floor beside the open window. My guardian had come to warn my mother that
I had been keeping company with her. She told my mother that she was not a good influence on
me and that I should be protected from her. My mother laughed, hard and bitter, and then she told
my guardian that her concern was too late and that there was nothing left in this world for me to be
protected from. My mother said I knew all the secrets of the world; she said I had been betrayed
and had learned how to protect myself.

Shortly after that, my mother left the village to seek work. I was alone with the baby in the one
room that was our house. I did not miss my mother because I had her. Our time together became
more open, and finally in the late of the nights as the stars blanketed the sky and the moon lighted
the dark to daylight, she told me of her time in that place. She started from the beginning and I
learnt that we both had much in common. Her experience differed in one important way from mine
â€” she had been a stranger to the village. Our uncle, Mr. Fletcher, had taken her in when she was
just a toddler. She had been left one Saturday evening with a small bag of clothes outside the gate
of the market. She knew her own name, but knew her own mother only as Mama. Her new parents
were kind in their own way; she had enough to eat and a bed to sleep on. She remembered that she
cried herself to sleep every night, until one night Mr. Fletcher came into her room and rocked her
to sleep.

Of the event that sent her to prison, she spoke about the pain and the aloneness. She remembered
the anger when he would bring her the cloth to tie down her belly and his insistence that she allow
him to give away the child when it was born. In prison she had been treated kindly by the other
women and mothered by many. They had known the truth of her actions. She had acted as a child
and broken a toy she did not want that had been given to her by someone she hated.

I told her then about me, about how I learnt about her and the stories and about the time our
