Prison Bread

HEN SHE CAME HOME FROM PRISON, SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF BREAD,

The bread was different from any I had seen before. Later I would learn it was French bread,
Baguette, to be exact. A Haitian warden had taught the women to make them, and they were baked
ceremoniously to celebrate the release of a prisoner.

No one in the village could remember a woman, much less a child, ever going to prison before.
She was given a sentence of life, later reduced to 15 years. When I was born, she had already served
seven years. Despite her incarceration, she never really left the village. She was the most constant
topic of conversation; all the other events simply interrupted the unending commentary at which

Our village was small and set high in the mountains. Every day, even at the height of summer,

and that would be that. The village was an easier place to live in if difficult issues did not stick
around too long.

There was only one road into and out of Chalky Hill. A wrinkled gray snake of asphalt, the
Parish Council had laid it down over the bridle and footpaths used by the founding families when
they first settled in the rocky, hilly interior. We were told that the elders had chosen this site for our
village because it was far from the plantations and hard to get to. Double protection in case freedom
was to be short lived. All the families had begun village life in wattle-and-daub houses built during
work days and give back days. In between, there was work to reap coffee and pick pimento and load
banana and peel ginger and mine whatever gold could be coaxed from the dark moist earth. The
