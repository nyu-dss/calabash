more well-to-do families made additions and renovations to their structures from block and steel and

At a certain time in the day, when the sun is high in the sky, if you stood at one end of the road
and turned around quickly, you could see daytime ghosts, spirit people trapped at the crossroads
waiting for nightfall to continue their journey. They were usually old and dressed in their Sunday
best and every one of them held a Bible in their right hand. It was said that they could not see you,
at least not in the daylight, and they were harmless. It was on one of those days that I first saw her.
She was too young to be a spirit, but I turned away and looked back again, quickly, thinking she
would disappear, but she didn’t. She stood tentatively in the square with her pelisse and a brown
paper bag filled with white sticks. She was not a stranger; that was clear from the steady confidence
of her gaze. She was looking for someone. As she walked towards me, I knew without asking who
it was. It was her — she had come home.

I grew up with a guardian, a woman named Mrs. Fletcher, whom I called auntie. My mother had
given me to her when I was a baby because she could not afford to take care of me. Mrs. Fletcher
lived in a big house with glass in the windows — and tiles on the floor that shone like marbles. In
return for her taking care of me, I ran errands for her and kept her company. She also made sure I
learnt how to cook and sew and mix drinks and walk softly and sit gracefully. She even made sure
I went to school, and most of the time I did not miss my mother.

Mrs. Fletcher was an important person in the village. Her husband was rich. He owned a motorcar
and he worked in an office in the main town. Most days after chores, Mrs. Fletcher would entertain
guests. As they settled on the verandah, it was my duty to serve cooling drinks. | kept my head down
so that they could see that I was not listening to their gossip. But when they began to talk about her,
I could not help myself; I listened as keenly as if her story was my own. I grew to anticipate her
appearance when they spoke about her. Summoned, she would appear when the animated clap-clap
of words and smooth rolling laughter faltered and the voices dipped, just a little. Then there would
be a soft rustle of clothing being rearranged, and boots settled and bags and pans laid to rest, and
the adults would lean in, just a little closer into each other; that was when she would come.

Whenever Mrs. Fletcher talked about her, I could not take my eyes from my guardian. My auntie’s
knowledge rendered her ageless and her sturdy body would sway back and forth with girlish glee
and her face would light up as she relayed the newest update. Even now I recall her mischievously
twinkling bright and all-seeing eyes belying the horrors she repeated. The adults would catch them-
selves in mid-sentence and I would be dismissed. That was when I took to hiding under the raised
platform of the house. The smell of the place was damp, old house damp from years of rain and
sun and old broken furniture and old wash water thrown from the washroom and the piss of the
lazy son and the dog and the occasional pig and the yard fowl that insisted on laying her eggs under
there and another smell I could not put name to. Squeezed in that cramped surroundings, I imag-
