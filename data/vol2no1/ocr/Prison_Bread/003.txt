ined that these same scents were in her prison cell; | somehow knew that she had no more space to
move and saw no more sunlight than I did here.

When I was about eight years old the stories changed. They became darker and more dense, with
a new and overheated urgency to their telling. Even in the bright sunshine of the afternoon, it
became as midnight when she appeared. Her case had begun to be mentioned almost on a daily basis
in the newspaper. It was reported that a great Kingston lawyer had taken her case and filed a plea
of temporary insanity to the Privy Council in London. The great Kingston lawyer had been persua-
sive, and it was rumored that the Lord High Chancellor would soon rule. The newspapers were full
of praise for the great Kingston lawyer; he was described as a great orator, and in time he would
gain international prominence from his handling of her case. The lawyer had argued that the point
of law that had been used to put her behind bars was not valid. He had begun a campaign in the
hallowed halls of the council to convince the members that not only was the application of that
particular interpretation of the law to her case unwarranted, but it also exceeded the limitations of
the intent of the law.

The adults on the verandah enjoyed reading about the skill of the great Kingston lawyer.

And their pride was evident as they read about his commanding and skillful use of the English
language and his knowledge of the law. They were not pleased that he was expending his genius

appeared more and more in her favor.

I remembered all of this as I looked at her. I also realized that in all the years I had never seen
a photograph of her and no one had ever given a physical description of her. In my mind she
remained the child she was when she first left the village. She was now an adult. Her eyes met
mine and | recoiled from the vacant and faded gaze that shot past me to look at my baby. Her
own eyes filled with the hot tears of remembered pain, and she walked past me without either of
us saying a word.

After that first day, I did not see her much. I no longer lived with my guardian and so I did not
hear a lot about her. I knew she had moved in with them, and the older people muttered and talked
amongst themselves about payback and good and evil. Whenever we saw each other a wordless
exchange bonded us close. In the village, I continued to hear the gossip going around again about
her. But it had lost the sweet satisfaction of the telling. She was back with us now. Solving her
mystery was no longer possible.

One day as I washed by the river, the wind picked up and the first drops of rain began to fall
from the sky that been overcast all day. I had not wanted to come, but I had to keep the babyâ€™s
nappies clean. As I grabbed the dried cloths from the bushes, another pair of hands joined mine. She
did not speak and I was too shy to. We worked quickly I gathered the white squares and crushed
them into round balls to throw into the washbasin. She took them from me and separately, and indi-
