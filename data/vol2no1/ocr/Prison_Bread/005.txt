Calabash

uncle, Mr. Fletcher, discovered my hiding place under the cellar. | remembered it as yesterday. One
day, as I listened to the hum of voices above me, the scent in the place changed. I turned my head
and saw my uncle watching me. He had entered from the other side of the house. He had been
searching for me. I did not speak, and he did not mention it to my guardian. From that day on before
going to my hiding place, I always made sure my uncle was not around. Having to secure his absence
meant that I sometimes missed some of the news about her.

Another day, after I had seen my uncle drive off, I went to my spot. My auntie had visitors, rela-
tives from abroad, and I knew that it would not be long before she appeared. I settled in and started
to peel an orange I had just picked. My sharp fingernails had just pierced the smooth skin of the
fruit when I felt something on my leg. It was a hand, a firm hand, a man’s hand. It was my uncle
and he had a knife. He took the orange from me and peeled it, a skillful movement of round fruit
and sharp steel. The peel did not break and he looped the necklace of rind around my neck. He
sliced the top off of the orange, perfect and round, and put it into his mouth and sucked it, then he
put it, the same spot he had sucked, into mine. I wanted to bite his hand.

I could not move. He held me captive as my auntie told the story I had come to know by heart.
She explained that the yard girl who had lived with them was the very same person the great
Kingston lawyer was working to get released from prison. Her new voice, heavy and leaden, spoke
of how the girl had given birth in this very house, and how she, my guardian, had not known that
the girl was pregnant, and how the girl had cracked the newborn baby’s neck and left the mess in
the washroom for my auntie to find. My auntie then went on to explain, in hushed familiar tones,
that her husband had begged her not to turn the girl over to the police but that she had done her
Christian duty and given the girl to the authorities. She was not pleased that this man, the great
Kingston lawyer, was going to get her off.

I heard all this as my uncle’s body pressed mine into the cool hard ground. I inhaled the scent of
the damp, the stink of his sweat, and the dust and the mildew, and that other faint unfamiliar smell
became stronger until the thick cloud of its strangeness threatened to suffocate me. I would learn
later that what filled my lungs that day was the black stench of betrayal.

I asked her finally about the bread, and she showed me how to make it. I look back now at that
time and marvel at the vicissitude of faith. She lives with me still, and even though neither of us
had another child, our home is filled with the laughter and happiness of girls making prison bread
for sale.
