POEMS: THE HARRIET TUBMAN

ast
truth

massus metal weight
push in my headbone

i was round thirteen
then them say i’se dull

now i know de lord
hear me in prayer

much mo’ like talk tho
we’s all de time talkin

when i wash my face
i says lord make me clean

when i take up de broom
lord sweep sin from my heart

when de blackness come
i go where God wants
