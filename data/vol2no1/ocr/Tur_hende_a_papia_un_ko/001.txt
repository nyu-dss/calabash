T is the first line of a folksong in which an African-Curacaoan woman demands to tell her own
story. She uses a traditional vehicle, music, to articulate her message to others. Aftican-Curacaoan
culture has been an oral one, depending on oral transmission for its survival. In oral cultures, the
interaction process takes place in face-to-face situations. People give special importance to those
communicating the information (Goody, 1992:16). In Curacao,? like other Caribbean societies, oral
traditions have been primary tools by which to pass on information from generation to generation.
Oral tradition, in this paper, refers to this practice by working-class people of using songs, proverbs,
stories, etc. to pass on information to their families and to other members of the community. This
information is an important tool for teaching and consciousness-raising. The scenarios for oral
tradition are based on events, problems, and successes experienced in the community. African-
Curacaoan women have been important transmitters of oral tradition. In oral tradition, women
convey their messages, showing in that way that they were not merely observants, but participants
in their society, yet whose voices were for long not heard in history.

In this paper, I will examine to what extent African-Curacaoan women used songs to verbalize
their experiences and concerns. I will apply the descriptive/exposition approach and will allow
women to give their account of their lives through songs. The songs used as illustrations in this paper
are not necessarily collected from female informants, but their texts center on women’s lives, I will
use both songs collected by Brenneker and Juliana in the sixties and seventies} and collected by
myself from the eighties onwards. Furthermore they are also songs collected for the project “Hidden
Voices” in 1992, with the objective of studying women oral culture. 4

In order to structure the wide range of song genres, I have decided to analyze these songs, which

are sung in the local Creole language, Papiamentu>, according to the following categories:
