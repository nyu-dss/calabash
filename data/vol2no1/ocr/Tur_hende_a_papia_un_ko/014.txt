Ayeta m’a mira mi kombles
E ta bin ta tira pufia pa mi
e ta bini lagami sabi
ta kon mi ta sintimi awor,
dalia a bai lagami
ningun kontesta mi no dun’é
mi kacho ke respond’é
mi di kuné larga e so ladra kaya
pasobra e ku kaya ta igual
Mi kacho ta miho kuné
pasombra e tin derechi, e tin banchi*!

translation:

 

Yesterday, I saw my kombles (rival)
She came and threw words at me
She came and told me
How do I feel now that
my man has left me
I did not give her any answer
I let my dog answer her
I told her to go and bark in the street alone
because she and the street are the same
My dog is better off than her
because it has rights, it has a penny

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Songs portray experiences people have encountered in their life and therefore furnish us with
valuable information. Women communicate through songs their own concerns, such as their
partnership with males, their feelings of happiness and disappointment with their children, their
feelings towards their parents, and the nature of their relationship with other women. Furthermore
traditional songs can give us insight into how women saw their own position in society and how
they dealt with it. The study of these traditional songs and stories can thus help to direct academic
discussions on gender roles as they identify otherwise hidden areas of concern to women themselves.
