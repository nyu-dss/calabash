this song to the emigration of men to Cuba, but given the text it could have also dealt with any
other past emigration to countries such as Panama, Venezuela, and Santo Domingo. Curacaoans,
both men and women migrated to escape poverty in their country. However, mostly men emigrated,
and women remained behind in extremely poor economic conditions, living from hand to mouth.?°
The following stanza expresses the significance of abandonment . The woman reflects on the
departure of her lover, who had not even told her that he was leaving.

The following song gives an example of this:

Ai m’a subi un seru
Ai m’a mira un barku
Rosa a bin bisami
ku mi dalia ta na bordo
Hisa bela

hisa bela bo bai 26

translation:

I climbed a hill
I saw a boat
Rosa came and told me
that my lover is on board
Set the sail
set the sail
set the sail and go
