songs like the following, which stress obedience to mothers.

“Pobersito Elias a hafia dafio na su pia
Tur esaki den bahada di e kaminda di Westpunt
Si bo a tende konseho ku bo mama a dunabo
Awe lo bo n’ta yora rakatum rakatum38

translation:

 

Poor Elias injured his leg
All this happened at the slope of the road to Westpunt (western part of the island)
If you had followed your mother’s advice
now, you would not have been crying rakatum,rakatum

Education was something done communally and was not limited to a certain age. Through songs,
the community as the following stanza of the song shows, could reprimand even adults who did
not keep to certain rules. Dédé, the son of Chéché, is questioned about his drunkenness and is
warned that he will cause his mother’s death with his misbehavior.

Dédé di Chéché

Kon bo por hasi un kos asina?
Dedeé di Chéché

Kon bo por laga rom gafiabo?
Dedé di Chéché

Kon bo por lora den shinishi?

CHORUS:

Si Chéché tende
Chéche ta rabia mata kurpa
Si Chéché tende
Chéché ta rabia mata kurpa39

translation:

Dédé, son of Chéché
How can you do something like that?
Dédeé, son of Chéché
How can you allow rum to fool you?
Deédé, son of Chéché
How can you roll yourself in ashes like that?
