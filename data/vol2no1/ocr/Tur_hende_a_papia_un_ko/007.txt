Calabash

This song can be seen as a way of finding hope when left behind. The refrain also shows anger;,
nonetheless, it portrays a feeling that one does not care that the person has left. In that sense the

song expresses the same philosophy as the verse of the following banderita.27In this song, the door
8 exp P phy g 8

symbolizes opportunity for a new life.
The banderita says:

Dalia bo ta bai
Dalia bo a hasi bon di bai
Karpinté a traha dos porta
pa sali un malu drenta un bon 28

translation:

Dalia (my love) you are going
You did well to go
The carpenter made two doors
to leave through a bad one, and enter a good one.

Love themes, naturally, form one of the important categories of songs. In love-songs, women

clearly express how they perceive the dependency of men on them. The following song shows what
women thought about this dependency.

Fransinét a laba lomba’i Dodoi
Fransinét a laba kama’i Dodoi
pa chincha n’kome lomba’i Dodoi
Pa Dodoi hasi saltu mortal29

translation:

 

Fransinet has scrubbed Dodoi’s back
Fransinet has cleaned Dodoi’s bed
so ticks wouldn’t eat his back
and Dodoi would make a break-neck leap

Women’s strength is also apparent in the following song in which the woman demands
faithfulness from the man:

Tobo ku laba ’ki
lo n’por laba ’ya.

chorus: a keli manbea
Washi ku washi ‘ki,

lo n’por washi "ya
chorus: a keli manbea3°
