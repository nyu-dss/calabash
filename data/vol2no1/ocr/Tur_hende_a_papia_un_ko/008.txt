Another popular theme in women’s songs is the mother-child relation. Were their ties always as
harmonious as we would like to believe? How did the mother relate to her son? Was it different from
the way she related to her daughter?

The relationship between mother and child has been expressed not only in songs but also in
children’s games such as the one called mama ku yu, a game that corresponds with the one named
“Father and Mother”, or in a term such as kas di mi mama to denote the house where one has grown
up. People are advised to love their mother, because according to a saying, those who no longer have
a mother will be nourishment for the warawara, which is a bird of prey [Esnan ku n'tin mama, lo ta
kuminda di warawarap?) or they will be worse off than a streetdog [Kacho di kaya ta ma mthé ku nan].
Children are warned that yu ku no ta tende ku mama, ta kai den boka di kolebra, meaning that children
who don’t listen to their mother will fall in the snake’s mouth.

In songs, the mother appears very often. An example of a song in which the mother is present
and which many of us who have grown up on the island have heard as a children’s song is the next
one. It also reveals that children are an investment for aid later on, when their parents become elderly.

Mama nami kuminda
pa mi bai mi skol

Mafian ku mi bira grandi
ta bon pa mama mes32

Mother, give me some food
For me to go to school
Tomorrow, when I have grown up
It is good for mother herself
