Calabash

Oh mother, look at her crying
Because she is going to lose her son
Mama, don’t you cry
I am the cockroach
which will fool the hens and fly away.

The different approaches to the two sexes is also manifested in the following song. Women
exercised control on sexuality by protecting the virginity of their daughter before marriage. The
protectiveness of the mother towards her daughter is reflected in the following song, while the latter
rebels against this.

Mama n’ke pa mi bai aki
Mi mama n’ke pa mi bai aya
Mama por serami den un kashi di glas
mand’é den kombentu serka ser3>

translation:

 

Mother don’t want me to go here
My mother don’t want me to go there
Mama can lock me up in a glass cabinet
and send it to the sisters in the convent

The two following songs also show, that young women not only lamented their situation and
questioned the protective attitude of their mother, but also rebelled against it and took the side of
the one they loved. In these songs, young girls showed independent judgment of the situations,
rather than complying with what their mothers expected of them.

Mi dushi a skirbi mi un karta
kontentu mi ta lesele
mi mama a pasa kitele
mi mes a keda bashi

E karta lo bo kit’é
nos amor bo n’por kita mas
e karta lo bo kit’é

nos amor a kria rais.36

166 / Rose Mary Allen
