Not always is the relationship between mother and child as harmonious as one would like to
believe. Especially the relationship between the mother and daughter can be full of conflict, as the
mother very often is too protective of her daughter. The saying is: a man will fall, but will still remain
a man, but a woman, if she falls, will damage her whole future. [Un mucha homber ku kai den lodo ta
keda homber, pero un hende muhé no. This philosophy is also expressed in the following banderita:

Mi ta mama di yu muhé i di un yu baron

Si yu muhé baha mi kara
Mi baronsito lo lamanta}3

translation:

 

I am the mother of a girl and a boy
But if my daughter puts me down
My son will lift me up.

The ambivalence in women’s lives is clearly shown here. The same woman who is protective of
her daughter at the same time allows her own son a lot more freedom. She expects marriage for her
daughter but not for her son, who often is a material supporter and whom she will not easily want
to give away. The next tambii-song, performed before an audience, and which I collected from a male
informant, describes the ambivalent attitude of the mother towards her children of different sex.

Hendenan tur yega serka
Mi ta bai kontabu mi pasashi
ma kaweta ta na porta
i ta bai bisa ku t’ami di
Ai mama, mir’é ta yora
ku e ta bai pérdé su yu baron
mama bo no yora
t’ami ta e kakalaka
ku ta dual galifia bula bai.34

translation:

People come and draw close
I am going to tell you my story
But gossip is at the door
And will say that I have said
