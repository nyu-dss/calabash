These women showed enormous verbal skills and devised words in their songs with which they
whipped people. The tamini-songs characterize themselves by the use of cunning wordplay and
double entendre. The composition of the texts received much attention and words had to be
carefully thought out to trigger a response by the chorus-singers, dancers, drummers, and onlookers.
The laughter and cheers of the crowd would stir up the singers. In these tambii-songs women often
went beyond the boundaries set by society, and showed assertiveness and courage in the

compositions and presentations of their songs.

MALE-FEMALE RELATIONSHIPS

Many folksongs shed light on how women dealt with men, and female-male relationships were
very often motifs in these folksongs. Situations in which women became pregnant and were left alone
by fathers-to-be were sometimes themes of songs. I collected the following song from a male
informant, who told me that it was sung by a woman in a tambi-celebration at the plantation where
he lived at the beginning of the twentieth century. The woman-singer regrets that after she
functioned as a helpmate for her man, he sent her back to her mother when she became pregnant.
In these songs with sexual references, words are not said directly but metaphors are used. In this
song, the relationship between women and men is referred to as a commercial transaction. The
woman feels exploited by the man, and by singing this communally, she also warns other women
against the selfish attitude of some men. However, the fact that a man retained this song also shows
that it was not only aimed at women.

The text of the song is as follows:

Tur hende a papia un ko’

Ta kon mi so n’papia nada?
paso m’a hasi un negoshi
m’a e negoshi n’kumbinimi
Ma hasi negoshi
Ma negoshi a sali malu
M’a kumpra un bari di suku pretu
M’a bende, m’a pérdeé ariba
Shonnan el a pidimi rosa mondi
El a pidimi kima sushi
Awo ku bdshi ta na ranka
el a mandami pa mi mama.!8
