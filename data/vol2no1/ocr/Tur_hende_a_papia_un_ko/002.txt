WOMEN’S ROLE IN FOLKSONGS

John Storm Roberts states in his book Black Music of Two Worlds that a main characteristic of
traditional African music is that it is interconnected with daily living. Music serves a purpose and has
a social use (Roberts, 1998: xxvi). Thus, traditional songs are rooted in the life of people. Their texts
cover up “deeply situated human behavior” (Bauman, 1983: 362). The lyrics expose values not
openly manifested on the surface of everyday life and often express deep feelings, that are not
permitted to be verbalized in other context. Songs, thus, give us data on cultures, especially those
without an extensive literary tradition® (Alan Lomax and J. Halifax, 1971). For women’s studies, they
are valuable research material to help demythologize certain ideas regarding women, as they restate
how they voiced their lives. By systematically analyzing the texts of folksongs, this paper will expose
communal values, norms, and perceptions of African-Curagaoan women of themselves as well as
their social reality.

Most of the traditional songs in this paper appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century
and dealt with issues of everyday life. At that time, the life of these working-class women revolved
around two different spheres. On one side, their life was centered on their homes and around their
family obligations as daughters, wives, partners, mothers, aunts, godmothers, stepmothers, and
grandmothers. On the other side, many of these women combined their domestic work with other
types of activities. They made substantial contribution to the welfare of the home’, especially during
times when men emigrated to work in countries in the region.8 One of the principal economic
activities of women was the making of straw hats. They also labored as washers, ironers of clothes?,
and household maids. Some were involved in trade as owners of small shops, where they sold
merchandise to people in the community. Others were herbalists, sometimes midwives, and had
privileged positions among members of their community.

Similar to men, women sang during gatherings or while they worked at home. Songs functioned
as an outlet for individual and communal tensions, or sometimes as a vehicle of protest. These songs
were important channels for expressing feelings. For most women, life was not easy, and by singing
about it they could transcend the difficulties. An informant underlined this statement by saying that
when she sang, she would forget her problems and life would seem bearable again.

Women categorized their songs into the following genres: religious!°, children’s, love and work
