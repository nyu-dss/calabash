CHORUS:

If Chéché hear this

Chéché will get angry and kill herself
If Chéché hear this

Chéché will get angry and kill herself

The mother’s mother (grandmother) is emphasized in some of the songs. The grandmother has
for long been and still is a substitute child-carer. In the extended family-structure, grandmothers
performed an important role socializing. This relationship with grandmothers is also present in songs
such as the following:

Ami si n’tin rekompensa
pa mi paga na n’un hende
solamente wela grandi eh,

k’a pari mama, k’a pari mi40

translation:

 

I don’t have to thank anybody,
except my grandmother, who
gave birth to my mother, who gave
birth to me

RIVALRY BETWEEN WOMEN

Most women, until now, have had to deal with partner-sharing, because most men do not engage
in only one monogamous relationship. Formerly the wife called her rival kombles. Songs in which the
kombles is mentioned as a rival are numerous and are indications of the impact of this phenomenon
on the life of women.

Unlike the first two songs in this paper, in which the singers looked for support from other
women, the following song shows rivalry and reflects the fragile position of the kombles. The lyrics
of the song give a related allusion that she might have the love of the man, but still lacks a legal
position. There is no law which protects her and to which she can turn to when problems within the
relationship occur. Again, in these types of songs dealing with adult life, the meaning is not given
explicitly, but metaphors are used.
