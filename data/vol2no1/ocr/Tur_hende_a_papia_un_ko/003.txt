songs, lullabies, and also satirical songs. Some of these songs were sung in the antiphonal structure
of call and response and allowed for a close relationship between individual singer and community,
This musical structure shows the strength of community. Levine sees this sense of community as an
evidence of African culture, which enslavement had not destroyed. (Levine, 1983:343)

Women performed songs both in private and public spheres. These songs were named according
to the activities performed. There were songs for grinding millet in the metate!!, called kantika di
mula maishi (songs for grinding millet)!?. The kantika di bati maishi (songs for pounding millet), in
contrast, were sung while rhythmically pounding millet in the tree-trunk mortar. There were also
songs to accompany the pounding of cactus (kadushi)!3 with the mortar, tat, These songs were
called “kanttka di tati”'4 (songs to pound cactus). Through cradle songs, the kantika pa pone mucha
drumi, mothers interacted with their babies and with others in the surroundings. Women sang while
washing their clothes in a group or individually. Songs were also segments of storytelling and of
ring-game activities.

Other songs were performed communally in public. The kantikanan di Seti, (harvest songs) for
example, were sung during the celebrations of the harvest of millet in the month of March and
April. The harvesting occurred in different phases. First, the millet was harvested. The men cut the
millet, while the women picked and placed the millet in special baskets called dakwe. During this
phase, songs were sung. People also sang when they marched to the rhythm of the drum, cow-horn,
and the piece of plough, the agan, to store millet in the magasina (storage place). Most of the songs
sung during the harvest-celebration were those called kantika di piki, and were sung during digging
activities. During this sez/-celebration these songs would be transformed by changing the rhythm and
cadence to accommodate their use for the procession!5 (Rosalia, 1989). The existence of such a large
number of digging-songs implies that African-Curacaoans had their own ideas of what work was
about. Analyzing these songs within their contexts would help to demystify the long-existing notion
that African-Curagaoans were lazy people.

Another category of these songs is the kantika di tambii.'6 Compared to the other genres of songs,
which have disappeared, the tambii still exists. The tambi is an activity accompanied by music,
drumming, and dancing, performed in the months around the end and the beginning of the year.
The lyrics of the songs comment on events that happened during the year and which were
disapproved of popularly. They also refer to individuals, either from one’s in- or out-group, who
misbehaved during the year. These songs create a kind of cohesion and solidarity among people,
and furthermore reinforce societal values. In addition, sometimes these songs aim to solicit and
arouse outside support and sympathy for someone or a situation.

Women often functioned as singers of these tambii-songs, kantikadé di tambi. This was contrary
to the sei-celebration, where the lead-singer would always be a man. One example of these women

is Petronilia Coco, who was popular for her songs, and who recently passed away at the age of 85.17
