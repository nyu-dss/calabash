with my children. I had three children, two girls and one boy. In the morning I would stand up, say my prayers and then
go to work. We didn’t have anything. I had to work with my arms. The government could not help anybody. I would go
into the wood and collect berries, the fruits of cactus, and fill up my basket with them. In the rainy season I would work
the garden, and afterwards carry the products to town to sell. I would carry my basket on my head. Sometimes rain would
meet me on the road and I would get wet. I would just take off my dress, wring it out and put it on again. “AAINA, Project
