Nights my great grandfather sat on the darkened verandah of memory
looking out into the ink-blue sky. I would be curled at his feet,

a great dark cat. He would tell me then how he came

to be in this place, how he had met my great grandmother,

the life they built together. “I was a young man then,”

he would begin, “and there was nothing doing in Hanover.

Already I had fathered two children and I spent my days carousing

the streets and drinking. Someone told me there was work in Portland

and I packed my bags and came. I was a strapping young lad then,

adventurous, with a simple plan of making enough money and returning home.

I did not know I would never see that life again, would never

see my parents again, and only one sister followed me here.

I have often wondered about those first two children — they must be
grown people by now, with children, grandchildren, of their own.
When I met your great grandmother she was all arms and legs,
nothing much to look at. From the start

she was a difficult woman, set in her ways, unwilling to bend; a true

Jamaican woman. We were married one year later: she was sixteen,

I was twenty-one. I then worked these sugar cane fields.

Over the years life has been fairly good to us: we own

the house we live in, eight of our twelve children are still alive.

Can you believe after sixty-one years that woman

still has a temper?” He would stop talking then, lean back into his chair
and I would draw even closer to him. The stink-sweet smell of a ripe
Jackfruit hung heavy in the air around us. His hair was silver-white,

his mottled skin covered with dark brown spots. The tiny

kerosene lamp on the verandah was the only light for miles.
