multitude of dead bodies this child had been circumstantially forced to witness and of the types of
images he revisited in his sleep, Furthermore, how would those witnessed crimes manifest themselves
in his daily interactions or possible confrontational situations later on in his life?

We breathe violence, we fear violence, we inflict violence, we are traumatized by violence. In the
summer of 1993, when I informed my mother that I would be working for PBS’s Frontline as a
researcher and would eventually be travelling to different parts of Haiti conducting research and
documenting human rights violations, my mother stayed silent for a while and then said to me in
the calmest of voice: “I know you care about Haiti, but must you go risk your life with those moth-
erless sentinels who would kill their own family for power!” I understood her worries, and she
supported my commitment as a social activist and a truth seeker. By her look and her gaze, when
she did not argue against my decision, I was wordlessly assured that I would be okay in the midst
of the chaos that was unraveling in Haiti.

Indeed, I was okay; that is to say I left Haiti alive and physically unharmed. However, there were
several instances where either the back of my head or my right temple made the unhappy acquain-
tances of FRAPH members 45-caliber or 9-millimeters) When the USS Harlan County was
supposedly scheduled to dock at the Habitation Portuaire’s port in Port-au-Prince, a group of about
thirty military attachés descended like angry wolves from an unmarked blue and white police bus
and began harassing and threatening the journalists. The moment they started kicking and jumping
around the US chargé d affairs’ blended black Cadillac, I took off my badge and quickly made my
way to our rented red sport utility vehicle. Once there, I came face to face with Chamblain, the
second-in-command of FRAPH. He pushed one and screamed at me and then pointed his 9mm to
the right side of my head. I calmly looked at him and said: “We are in the same camp, and down
with the Yankees.” He responded like a bullfrog: “Yeah! fuck the Yankees and that little shitty priest.”

When I got into the vehicle, I was perspiring like a decathlon runner. Then I spotted our producer
June, as well as our Washington investigative reporter Bob, running full speed away from a vengeful
crowd. By the time they got into the vehicle, Bob received a carnival of slaps and kicks. Of course,
I angered Chamblain who realized that I was a temporary imposter. He kicked the left front door
and fired two rounds in the air. Through his coyote-like gaze, I knew he wanted my blood. Without
hesitation, I sped out of the seaport area leaving dust and angry attachés behind.

In light of, and despite of my love for Haiti, and in the pain of seeing the depiction of our
poverty through Western media, or humiliated Haitian faces whereever they may be, I have to put
aside my nationalism while facing the ugly truth that my country has gotten more dangerous and
unstable. Of course, one could write a book to deconstruct and expose the root causes for our culture
of violence, but that would be a further intellectual attempt to mask the truth. Regardless of reasons
or assigning of blames, basically it has been the same: since 1986; it has become more volatile and
violent, and the great majority of the people living in the urban areas are living with great stress and
