Strangely, I was told that the body had been there for at least four hours. However, what perturbed
me the most was that, not only was Delmas a densely populated area, with a constant flow of heavy
traffic, but while I stood there, an army truck with soldiers and a police officer on a motorbike drove
past the corpse as if everything were routine.

When we arrived at the hotel, I quickly rushed to my room and into the shower. For, whether
imagined or real, I smelled the odor of that man’s blood all over my body. After I took my shower,
I sat meditatively on the bed for a moment and firmly concluded that the country of my birth, the
land that I loved so much was a dangerous and volatile place. And no, it wasn’t because of the 1991
military coup, which helped in the crystallization of my trepidatious sentiments; but, overall, it’s the
consequence of a global accumulation of events that have led to our desperate reality. Thus, the
materialization of my cynicism and fear.

As a young boy growing up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, | was aware of the violence the Macoute
State of the Duvaliers had inflicted upon the people, as well as the people’s own ability to inflict
violence on one another. However, I never imagined witnessing or cataloging some of Haiti’s sense-
less acts of violence. It is well known among Haitians, that we tend to exaggerate and to create
believable phantasms. However, when crying grown-ups are retelling their dolorous stories, and
once-proud young men and women are shamefully revealing their scars and their missing limbs,
then one has to admit, however painfully, that some elements of the Haitian culture/experience are
indeed diabolical.

It is quite safe and very realistic to assume that almost every human being has witnessed some
level of violence, whether as a perpetrator, a victim, or a witness. As predatory and territorial animals,
our capacity to inflict violence on others is unsurpassable and at times simply incomprehensible; espe-
cially when the violence seems senseless and “savage”. If we were to go back to every epoch in
human history and catalogue the rise to, or fall from power, we would quickly notice that every
group, regardless of color or race, has been a perpetrator of violence. Of course, some groups have
been more prone to violence than others; and in recent history, the victors have developed ways to
hide or legitimate their hideous past by developing schemes to demonize their victims and or to
portray others’ acts of violence as being pure savagery and uncivilized. But, regardless of ideolog-
ical or sentimental point of views, violence is violence and it’s malefic.

I was three years old when I first witnessed a violent argument between my mother’s father and
my father. Although I do not remember the content of their disputes, | remember it was over my
mother. Still to this day, although in faint imagery, I can easily recall the scene that took place on the
street in front of my grandfather’s house. It was almost twilight when my mother ran with me to
the back of the house and then went to our neighbors’ yard, where she could observe what was tran-
spiring between my jealous and overprotective grandfather and my fervent father. From what I
understood, Grandpa was opposed to Mom’s relationship with Dad, who was older, already married
