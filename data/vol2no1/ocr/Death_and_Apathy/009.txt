anxieties. Even the corruptible upper-class are finally admitting their fear and traumas due to the
witnessing and the proximity of the recent acts of violence. Violence is non-prejudicial and class-
less; although, one group or class (the poor) has always been more on the receiving end than another

group. Regardless, violence is violence.

Two days after the “Harlan County” incident, I was having lunch with the producer and a high
ranking Haitian-American spy who worked for the de facto military government and presumably for
the CIA, since he knew all of the field operatives and their roles. He informed us very nonchalantly
that a high minister would see his last day today. Right away, June changed my schedule, handed
me a camera, and said: “You have a good nose and you know where to go.” Intuitively, I headed
toward Justice Minister Guy Malary’s office. Malary was supposed to sign into law the separation of
the police from the armed forces, as well as releasing the names of those police officers who had
assassinated the well-known industrialist and Aristide supporter, Antoine Izmery. By the time I
arrived in Turgeau and was about to turn right near the church of the Sacré Coeur, where a mass of
people stood on the other side of the church morbidly gawking. I knew what they were viewing
from the distance was of capital magnitude.

When | parked the car and removed my cameras, a street merchant, a salt-peanut vendor,
cautiously said to me: “It’s anti-gang, careful, they are heavily armed. This is not a casual crime. They
knew too well what they were doing.” I thanked her and promised to be careful. About 30 yards
from the scene of the crime, I knew that the street vendor was right. The blue Toyota Landcruiser
of the Justice Minister was overturned on its left side and the body of the vehicle was riddled with
large caliber bullets. At close examination, I counted at least thirty-five holes around and underneath
the vehicle.

At the moment I arrived at the scene, we were only two journalists: a young British cameraman
and myself, and within ten minutes, at least eight other international journalists and some reporters
of the Haitian media were there as well. What was interesting was the fact that Michel Frangois, the
chief of the Haitian police, and four of his close entourage, as well as two Colombians, were there.
All were dressed in civilian clothes. Most interestingly, within forty-five minutes of the assassination,
the Haitian Red Cross came to pick up the bodies who were already laid on a horizontal line on the
sidewalk. I am certain that the bodies were dragged out of the vehicle to be identified and finished
off by the military assassins.

I was so taken by the professionalism of the killings, that somehow, despite time constraints, I
managed to videotape and to photograph almost everything. However, when Michel Francois and
some of the anti-gang high commanders wanted to verify the corpses, they pulled out their US-
made automatic riffles and forced the journalists out in a frenzy. We rushed out like crows. Some of

us were chased, while others jumped in the back of a pickup. I was among the pursued, and in the

fear of being caught and losing my prized tape and film, I gave my video to the salt-peanut vendor
