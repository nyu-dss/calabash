and then ran in the opposite direction. That day, if I am not mistaken, two men from a Mexican
News crew were arrested and then driven to the airport. It was assumed they had stayed behind to
film the police chief who had given orders not to be photographed.

When I arrived at the hotel, the CNN field researcher/manager offered me a fairly good amount
of money for the tape, which I declined because I was working for PBS. As soon as the Frontline
producer saw me, she was elated, for word had gotten around among the journalists that I had “the
goods.” Once again, it was until later that evening after I tried forcing myself to fall asleep that I
began processing what I had witnessed. The Assassination of Minister Malary was not a simple
matter, nor a basic “shoot them” kind of killing. It was well financed and orchestrated and those who
wanted to see his elimination were not simply concerned by the mere separation of the armed
services, but he was also about to release the names of those who were implicated in the assassina-
tion of businessman and Aristide supporter, Antoine Izmery who was gunned down a month prior
on the same street.

I was at home in Somerville when the phone rang and woke me that early Saturday morning on
the 11TH of September 1993. When I realized it was the producer on the other line, I knew by the
hesitation in her voice that something was wrong, but I didn’t know who had died. Before I even
had the chance to ask her any questions, she requested that I sit up and keep calm. Then, with as
much care as she could, she softly told me of the assassination of Izmery. Shocked and unable to
control my emotion, I broke down. Patiently, she stayed on the phone with me and then filled me
in on the details of his death after I insisted on hearing them. According to credible eyewitnesses
and later to partly-filmed tape, five police officers entered the church of the Sacré Coeur via different
doors and began shouting for people to get out; in the meantime, one of them radioed, and then
they started searching for Izmery, who realized he was in danger. While trying to take refuge behind
the altar, he was arrested and then dragged out to Avenue José Marti at the intersection of Avenue
Jean-Paul II near the Pax-Villa. There, he was forced to kneel down and then at close range was shot
eight times in the head. Despicably, one of the officers came back and hit him twice in the head
with a rock. When I first viewed the tape at the screening room, my co-workers had to pull me out
and consol me. I was literally a mess. Izmery had been a good friend and a good compatriot who
sought truth and justice as his motto, As someone of Palestinian descent, he was also not well liked
by the State Department nor by the other elite business members who had close association with
Israel or some of the Arab countries like Syria and Lebanon. Naturally, he became the enemy of all
from the ruling oligarchy who supported the coup d'état.

We breathe violence, we fear violence, we inflict violence, we are traumatized by violence. When
we left Haiti, it was about time. I had seen my share of violence and finally realized the depth of
the country’s psychosis. As I stated previously, I knew the level of violence that existed in the
country, but to actually document, and interview various victims of violence and to finally admit
