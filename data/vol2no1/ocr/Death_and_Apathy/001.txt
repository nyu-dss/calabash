Death and Apathy at the Crossroads

HEN I ARRIVED IN HAITI IN AUGUST OF 1993 AS A TELEVISION
WY ease videographer for the American PBS series, Frontline, the country was already
inundated in blood, and by night, it was drowned in the sounds of machine guns terrifying sleep.
From the cities to the provinces, members of the arm services and their attachés had enthralled the
consciousness of the population and they were snapping nerves with every kill.

On a daily basis, there were reports in almost every populous neighborhood in Port-au-Prince of
abandoned cadavers left to rot or to be eaten by dogs after they were shot by some fraction of the
military or the police. I, myself, afraid of blood and of dead bodies, grew accustomed to those ordi-
nary sights. Worst of all, and most disturbing, was the total defiance, this almost ecstatic joy some
of the young soldiers took in vanishing or exterminating those whom they perceived as Aristide
supporters. Even a colonel of the haut d’éat major stated, without shame, that he would be unable to
prevent any bloodbath, if President Aristide were to return, and, in fact, he would perhaps be among
those to kill him.

I knew my country was dangerous and pathetic, but I did not know the extent to which life was
so meaningless to those with the power to exterminate. One afternoon, the producer and I were
driving up to Pétionville via the Delmas route when we arrived at 82nd Street, where a huge crowd
gathered. I automatically stopped the car, pulleded out my camera, and headed to the center of the
scene. As I traversed the crowd of onlookers, the stench of fresh blood infiltrated my nostrils. There
was a group of men, who, despite the grotesqueries of what they were viewing, entrusted hand-
kerchiefs to their mouths and noses in order to refrain from vomiting; yet they kept on staring at
what I suspected was a cadaver.

When I passed through the crowd, I found myself almost on top of what was a young man, lying
on his back, his body half-covered with a bloody white sheet and pieces of his brain matter strewn
all around him. Despite the gruesomeness of the sight, I proceeded with taking pictures and inter-
viewing eyewitnesses. Supposedly, the man, unnamed, tried to steal some bread and sugar from a
well known street vendor, and as he was trying to flee the scene amidst the shouts of “bare vole’
(catch the thief), an armed civilian shot him in the back; and as he was staggering to cross the street,

he landed underneath a moving truck which crushed his brains.
