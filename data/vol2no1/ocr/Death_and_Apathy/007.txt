constitutionally banned for ten years from all governmental posts, were enraged and reacted to
their squalid nature by violently disrupting the election at one of the voting places on ruelle
Vaillant. They opened fire with their US made machine guns, leavin, about twenty people lying in
a pool of their own blood.

On the day of the election-massacre, army officers who were on hand to provide safety did
absolutely nothing to capture the aggressors, who wore the typical Macoute red armbands. When
our Haiti correspondent finally called in with descriptive details about the events, although
attempting to remain professional, he was clearly affected by the carnage that unfolded in front of
him. That evening, all of the networks aired the massacre. It was after that event that my mother
decided to give up her Haitian citizenship and to be become a citizen of the United States. Many
of us were angered and felt disillusioned by yet another violent chapter in the Haitian saga and quest
for justice and democracy. We knew that our long-awaited dreams of democracy had been post-
poned for a long time, and only a well orchestrated social revolution would bring about a significant
and long-term qualitative change.

As the events unfolded, it became clearer that the army and members of the legally dismantled
Macoute Corps worked together under the command of former colonel Frank Roumain, a
Duvalier supporter, and Jean-Claude Paul, a colonel in the army who was later poisoned by his
wife by means of our nationally beloved pumpkin soup. The massacre of the 29TH of November
was carried out to perpetrate the state of terror and also to reunify all of the Duvalier supporters
against any popular movement that could eventually lead to a more just and open society. In the
days following the massacre, the bombing of radio stations and attacks against journalists, the
people activated another level of the Dechoukaj movement. They sought the immediate destruc-
tion of all unredeemed Macoutes, army officers, and Duvalier supporters. This time, the
Dechoukaj went beyond the borders of the paupers and into the affluent neighborhoods where
some of the ardent Macoutes resided. Unfortunately, it was still the poor who felt the peopleâ€™s
wrath. This stage of the Dechoukaj was so brutal and disconcerting that even members of the
popular movement asked for a change of tactics. Deplorably, the level of violence and the public
ecstasy was too elevated to change the course of events.

When I received further pictures and videotapes, I became disturbed and disgusted by what I was
viewing. One of the pictures was of a castrated and mutilated man who, lying naked with a tiny
yellowish flame burning where his genitals once had been; he was gutted and both his wrists were
mutilated. Around him were rocks, an iron pipe, and a couple of laughing men leaning towards the
body to celebrate their latest destruction. To the right and rear of those two men was a line of about
fifteen onlookers with different expressions on their faces. Some looked happy, while others were
simply puzzled. Among them was a small boy of no more than twelve years old, his body half
hidden behind a gawking woman; his thumb in his mouth. At that moment, I wondered about the
