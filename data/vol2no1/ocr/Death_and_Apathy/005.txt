away from a young man’s corpse. When I saw her last in 1991, she was in good health and relatively
happy, and within two years after the coup, prior to her death, she had aged at least five years.

We breathe violence, we fear violence, we inflict violence, we are traumatized by violence, and for
most of our history, we have been governed by violence. Now, with rampant poverty, the destabi-
lization of civil society, widespread corruption within government, and the overall use of, as well as
trafficing of narcotics by Haitians regardless of class, Haitian society, especially in the urban envi-
ronment, is fast becoming violent and uncontrollably dangerous. Violence is not new to the culture.
We have been the victim as well as the perpetrators of violence. However, the scale and the mani-
festation of it seem greater than anything we have yet seen among civilians. In recent years, especially
under the Duvaliers’ regimes, it was the state that constantly assaulted the population; now violence,
it seems, has become our common denominator.

In February 1986, after Jean-Claude Duvalier and his most trusted entourage fled the country
aboard US military planes, the country experienced an explosion of vengeful violence against those
poor and notorious Macoutes who had committed the most atrocious acts of repression against the
civilian population. These civilian acts of revenge are popularly known as Dechoukaj. Dechoukaj, a
metaphor in the Haitian language that symbolizes the extraction of trees from their roots, is now an
anarchical tool used to annihilate the enemies of the people. It is a destructive popular political
process set in place as a substitute for legal Justice.

Not to be simplistic or philosophical on the issue, but the outbursts of violence Haiti has endured,
are the direct results of centuries of colonial repression during slavery; generations of political strife
and governmental instability; and years of the United States’ transgressive and aggressive policies.
Most recently, after the 1934 US occupation, the people were subjugated to decades of ruthless dicta-
torial regimes that plundered the country’s economy and suppressed any movement toward judicial
lawfulness.

As a result of those centuries of combined repression and humiliating pain, when the people
finally sought justice on their own, the state responded more violently. Consequently, given the
chaotic and volatile nature of the country, individuals’ anger and repressed hate spilled over and
caused communal catastrophes that were manifested through savage intra-civilian, anti-civilian, and
sometimes anti-police violence. Whatever the rationales or causes of those violent acts, violence
begot violence and the country, regardless of sentimentality and nationalism, is still very dangerous.

In 1986, when the state’s repressive lid was abruptly removed, the people’s Dechoukaj movement
materialized and became embedded in the nation’s psyche. Some, mostly those who benefited from
the Duvaliers’ extractions, dreaded it to their cores. To others, mostly the masses, it became their
wheeling justice, their power broker. In fact, the Dechoukaj was so widespread, that new metaphors
were birthed. Pére Lebrun, for example, which was the name of an old man who used to sell tires
in Port-au-Prince, was culturally and linguistically transformed to Pélebren and became the
