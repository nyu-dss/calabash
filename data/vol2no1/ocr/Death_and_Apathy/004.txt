of the adults and all of the children were aftaid to pass by the house where the murder took place.
It was believed that the house became haunted, and Bayard’s ghost used to be seen roaming the
neighborhood. Come to think about it, the adults seemed more perturbed by the presence of a
ghost, instead of the ability of a man to cut off another man’s head with a machete.

Although I grew up very happy, healthy, and well-protected by the neighborhood and overall
harbor positive memories, I have nonetheless witnessed the transformation of friendly men who
joined the Macoute Corps and later turned into monsters, ruthlessly defending the Duvaliers’
doctrine. One such person, was a certain Gros Joel who became the arch enemy of Manno
Charlemagne, a popular Haitian folk singer who sang uplifting and politically charged songs against
the Duvaliers, I do not recall the exact day, but it was September 22, 1978. It must have been around
seven in the evening, and the Macoutes had barely started their anniversary celebration, when Gros
Joel smashed a bottle of Barbancourt rum against the blue wall of Naelle’s house and then started
spraying it with bullets out of an Israeli Uzi. As he was reloading a new magazine into the Uzi, he
let out a deep and cynical laugh, and then said: “Fuck you, bunch of communists, tell Manno, the
little singing shit, that I have the power.”

Having to realize, accept, and finally admit the violent tendencies or aspects of one’s country is
very painful, but necessary. I could not have just gone on lecturing about Haiti’s great history and
denouncing the colonial powers for exploiting this peninsula and instilling violence. However true
it is that the Western powers have directly participated in the political and economic destabilization
of Haiti, the fact of the matter remains that we are an autonomous people and we are perpetrating
the colonial masters’ mentality of brutality. Violence is violence, and it is doubly painful when it is
intra-inflicted and progressively degenerating national development, as well as the overall psyche.

Although it is necessary to bear witness and to be an active agent for social change, it is, however
painful to process, relive, and come to terms with witnessed violence. There are times I have wished
I could simply erase certain troubling memories, or at least not care as much. At other times, I feel
fortunate to have a conscience and a consciousness that can recall, and make sense of those
disturbing memories like the assassinations of Antoine Izmery and Guy Malary. I will later elaborate
on both of these cases.

We breathe violence, we fear violence, we inflict violence, and we are traumatized by violence.
When Aunt Lucrése left Haiti for New York during the summer of 1993, she simply wanted a vaca-
tion, a breather from Haiti's chaos, Unfortunately, after barely a month in New York, she died in her
sleep. Before her death, she complained a great deal about how the military attachés used to make
their rifles sing a chorus of terror outside her bedroom window. Sometimes, she felt her head was
filled with a strange ringing, an extended ping that interrupted her basic daily chores. One early
Sunday morning, on her way to church, she noticed some of the neighborhood’s dogs agitatedly
gathered in a pack, while a slender street merchant with her hand over her mouth tried to drive them
