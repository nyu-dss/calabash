with children, and who was believed to be a womanizer. Whether this was true or not is irrelevant.
Nonetheless, what mattered was what I perceived to be a fight between my dad and my grandpa.
Although I do not remember my grandfather striking my father, I do, however, recall seeing a big
wooden stick in Grandpa’s hands. Whether Dad had his own weapon in his hands (rocks or a
machete), I do not recollect. Nevertheless, I remember being scared and my mother had her hand
over my mouth while she held me on her lap in a crouching position behind a cement wall where
the street through one of its rectangular holes.

The home I grew up in, the street on which I interacted, the neighborhood in which I developed
my social understanding and roles, as well as my informal education, formed and informed my world
since childhood. It was within those places that I tasted violence, witnessed violence, and committed
my own violent acts. In retrospect, I can analyze and label those events as such; however, when I was
among those actors/witnesses, it was impossible to have the same perspective as I do now, for I was
socially insulated and I had a different interpretation of my own world. What I now recognize as
violence was then seen as simple fights where people got injured or beatup. Regardless, I have never
mistaken the Macoutes’ acts of aggression as for anything but abusive violence. Interestingly, when
a civilian had knocked down a Macoute, it was always fun and well-deserved.

At the age of six, in my grandfather's house, I woke up to a loud chorus of “bare vole” shouted
by my grandfather and my uncle who tried to corner a thief who entered the house at around four
in the morning. As he ran through the front of the house trying to escape my uncle who was chasing
him with a hammer, he came face to face with my grandfather who landed a cement block on his
chest. The thief fell face-down spitting blood. By the time grandpa and uncle Hubert went in the
back of the house to fetch a rope, the robber got up and staggered out. While he was getting up to
run, my mother’s and my screams had woken some of our neighbors. Before he even made it to the
main street, he was caught by two guys and severely beaten. Later on, the pain administered to him
became a neighborhood joke. I remember seeing the frustrated excitement of some of the men who
had not had the opportunity to partake in the destruction of this man.

We breathe violence, we fear violence, we inflict violence, and we are traumatized by violence, but
somehow we are unable to recognize our own apathy, our silent socio-cultural dementia that slowly
devours our beings, or causes us to explode over any minute infraction. Yes, we are a fun-loving
people, but our capacity to wreak senseless violence is incomprehensible.

I do not recall the exact age, but I must have been between five to seven years old when I over-
heard a detailed description of a gruesome murder which took place in a two-family house that
belonged to a well-known singer, Dodoffe Legros. Supposedly, Dodoffe’s brother, an ardent
Macoute, also a Legros, had a misunderstanding with his friend, a certain Lazard Bayard, who was
a well-liked and peaceful man. To resolve whatever dispute they had, Legros decided to cut off
Bayard’s head and leave the body in the middle of the street to rot. After hearing that story, some
