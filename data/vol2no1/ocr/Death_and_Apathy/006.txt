metaphoric action-verb of tire neck lacing. Pélebren is a very dreaded component of the Dechoukaj
movement.

The fear of the people’s Dechoukaj a la Pélebren is so acute that the military under the command
of General Raoul Cédras, used President Aristide’s speech on October 27, 1991 as an excuse to
execute, three days later, the planned coup d’état. In that speech, President Aristide referred to the
use of Pélebren as a legitimate tool against the elite’s refusal to pay their back taxes or continued
with their destabilization tactics against the government. Unfortunately, military might proved
stronger than the people’s Pélebren. During the period of the coup, over eight thousand people were
killed and close to one million people fled Haiti for the Dominican Republic and the United States.

Outside, those who fervently feared or welcomed the usage of Pélebren, there is a “silent
minority” who are absolutely opposed to the use of Pélebren as well as the repressive tactics of the
police on the basis of morality, ethics, and the simple fact that violence seems to be getting worse
and the country is more divided than ever. I fall into this category. I understand the use of the
Pélebren, but I am against it on the basis of its long-term negative effect and because it is not helping
to establish a state of law where everyone is equal and the country is regulated by fair and just consti-
tutional laws. Consequently, if we continue with this lawless state of affairs, we are destined to
collide in a major civil war and a more controlling foreign occupation.

We breathe violence, we fear violence, we inflict violence, we are traumatized by violence. Weeks
after the departure of Duvalier, the Macoute corps was dismantled and thousands amongst the
poorest of the Macoutes received different elements of the Dechoukaj. I was uncontrollably happy
knowing that Duvalier and some of his cronies were gone and that the people’s revolution would
finally be won. I became affected, however, despite my hatred for the Macoutes, when I received
pictures, articles and videos on the Dechoukaj that depicted without censorship all of the latest
developments. When I saw an unedited tape and subsequent photo of a man being burned alive and
his charred, fragmented body tied at the forearms to a wooden pole and festively paraded around
town with a dog dressed in Macoute gear. I knew I was witnessing the psychosis and apathy of a
traumatized people.

Two years later, on November 29, 1988, I remember we were at home celebrating my mother’s
birthday. She was expressing her wish to be in Haiti to cast her first vote in what was scheduled
to be Haiti’s first democratic and fair election. During the week leading upto the election, my
colleagues and I were hosting different radio shows around the Boston area, informing our audi-
ence about the candidates and the electoral process. Many of us were skeptical about the outcome
of the election if it were to take place. Up until the 29TH, everything seemed normal; the people’s
fear slowly vanished and they made their way to the voting places to fulfill their citizenship duty.
Some of the streets were lined with people, for miles and those who had the chance to cast their
votes were euphoric until the cultural swindlers manifested their gripe. Macoutes, who had been
