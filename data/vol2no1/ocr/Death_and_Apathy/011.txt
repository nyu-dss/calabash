one’s fear for one’s country was very devastating. Of course, despite this realization, I made several
more trips to Haiti with my camera and with my love for my battered country.

Despite the so-called “restoration of democracy” with the return of President Aristide to power
in October of 1994 and the succession of power of President Préval in 1996, violence and apathy
are present in today’s atmosphere, and the political ambience is still volatile and insecure where the
sounds of machine guns are still terrifying sleep and where nights and dawns remain the domain of
the criminals. Unfortunately, although to a lesser degree, dead bodies are still left to rot on the streets
or be eaten by dogs; yet, due to the strong Haitian will to live and survive, the people muster their
strengths throughout the cities and in the provinces to bypass the politico-cultural affliction that the
Duvalier legacy has inflicted and is now continuing to devour and enthrall the consciousness of the

people with the countless senseless killings occurring on a daily basis.
