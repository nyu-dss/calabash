Calabash

In light of this carnival

of nightsticks and stench,

I've desperately tried to write
about the movement of clouds

and pastoral images, but the screams
and agonies of a valley of Haitians
ferociously migrating to the center
of my pastoral scenes have torn up
the white lilies and the dandelions.
Instead of flowers,

my pen bled an agonizing nation.
