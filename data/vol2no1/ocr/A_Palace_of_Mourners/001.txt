A Palace of Mourners

I've tried to store away

and refrain memories from surfacing,

but miniature Houdinis escaped

from opaque brain cells

that harbored a palace of mourners

from the country of my birth

where nightsticks have swung from Columbus
to modern avarice leaders whose nefarious
passions have cooked fear into our psyche.

After nights of past memories

poking needles in my sleep,

floods of images breached the silence

of my pen. Joseph, a 26-year-old journalist,
arrested in August of ’92, demanded to speak.
My head became an echo-chamber

where the tales of the dead

and the brutalized reverberated.

Their screams, exploding

the coral of memories, forming

an enormous tapestry of narratives

and brutal images: like Joseph’s blistered buttocks
broken right knee, and cicatrices head.

?

The army wanted to teach his tongue

the language of silence.

Thin, glowing wires

turned his tongue into an eel,

slapping words to incomprehension.

Still, he did not swallow fear or confess.

His tongue trumpeted justice

despite his scars and inability to move bowels.
