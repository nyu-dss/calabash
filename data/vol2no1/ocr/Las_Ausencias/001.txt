Take an island, any island, make it this one, so blue
in Caribbean water, this crocodile cleansing itself
from being down so long. Think, /o que no estd,

that which isn’t there, this rock, that tree, all
of a child’s memory for /a distancia of thirty-
eight years, and counting. A wrought iron

balustrade, the picture of Jesus having dinner
with those other twelve angry men, Judas, of course
leaning away toward an open window, listens

to the caw-cawing of a raven on a fence post,
a rat’s heart in its claws. En esta isla de caddveres,
in this island of cadavers, yes, like those black

and white American 1950’s movies, a scaly, green
creature in the depths of an onyx lagoon. Zombies
for the lack of everything. The politic of forgetting.

Those of us without tomorrow. Los que no tenemos
maiianas, my mother likes to say. Here we eat,
says my wife, with or without you when I go off

on trips. Meaning what? I ask from the distances
I try to desperately bridge. But always, the dream,
an island in the middle of water. Call it an oasis.

A bull’s-eye you have to shut your eyes to hit.
