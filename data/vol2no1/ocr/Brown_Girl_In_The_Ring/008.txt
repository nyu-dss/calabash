never said any such thing! As we were saying sir ... Logan Palmer was the best looking boy in school
you know, and he loved me. Yes, I could see through the taunts and name calling ——- “Blackie,
Blackie, Black bud” — that he loved me. He just never knew how to show it. And that time, after I
get up my courage and tell him how much I like him, and him fling that stone and burst my head,
him never did mean it. When I went to school the next morning with the white cloth tie around my
head, the school children gathered around me, laughing and singing: “Blackie, Blackie, Black bud!”

After they took Daddy to jail, I never did see him again. Grandfather said no one was to mention
his name. There was an incredible strain in the house. It was like we were all carrying Daddy around
inside us, but was forced to hide him. One day out of the clear blue, Mama started to cry, and she
said to me, “Chile, I does miss your father real bad. Even though we were not on the best of terms,
and even though he is a real Kingstonian, and you know how those city people believe they know
everything, I cannot help but remember that we had us some real nice times together. He was the
first man who look on me, black and ugly as I am, and tell me that I was beautiful. I never believe
a word he said, but it sure was nice to hear somebody say it.” Mama’s lips began to tremble, and her
eyes got real red.

“It couldn’t put away the Nadinola skin lightening cream like he wanted me to do and when I
think we part over some foolishness like that I... L..” Mama didn’t get to finish her thought for
Grandfather came and she dropped the subject and never picked it up again.

Grandfather cried when I couldn’t take it anymore. Grandfather put his head in his hands,
hunched his shoulders, and just cried. In all my life I had never seen a grown man cry. Grandfather
said nobody loved him. That he wanted somebody to love him. Could I just please love him. I was
twelve years old. When I saw Grandfather crying like that, I felt sorry for him. We were under the
apple tree, a little way from the house. Was I really twelve or eleven years old? Grandfather said, if
I loved him I would let him touch me. I would let him put his thing inside me. I will never forget
the day, the first day that he put his “thing” inside of me, for it was that day that the voices started
to bother me.

After that I started getting bigger and bigger. None of my clothes could fit me anymore, and I
was going out of my mind with worry. I was in high school in Kingston. A scholarship student. A
bright girl. I wanted to stay in school. When I was at school, I was away from my Grandfather. But
Mother Superior sent for me, and I knew exactly what she was going to tell me. She wasn’t angry
at me, she just said it had come to her attention ... I stopped hearing what she was saying, for the
more she talked was the more I felt that there was no oxygen in the room, and I could not breathe.
