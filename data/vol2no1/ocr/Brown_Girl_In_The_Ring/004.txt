together for the longest time. After several years Grandy started to nag Grandfather, saying that most
of the women her age were matried already, and she wanted to go to her church, that she couldn't
go to her church because she was living with Grandfather “in sin.” One day Granny began quar-
reling and said she tired of living this sinful life, all these years and no ring on her finger.

“You know I’m not the marrying type — so make up her mind what you want to do.” Grandfather
said to Grandy one day.

Grandy never said another word to him after that. All I heard was the pots and pans banging in
the kitchen, and I knew she started cooking dinner. That night Grandy came into my room to sleep.
She wrapped her huge warm body around mine, and we slept like that for one whole month.

Soon after that Grandfather came home with a wedding ring and told Grandy of that tomorrow
they were going to the County Clerk Office in Bay to get married.

You should see how Grandy ’s face lit up when Grandfather told her that. It was as bright as any
Christmas tree.

The next morning Grandy got up early. She dressed in her blue-and-white polka dot dress and
her white mesh hat. Grandfather put on his black-and-white suit that he only wore to weddings and
funerals. Together they caught the bus to Bay.

When Grandy came home that evening, she had a ring on her left finger. She looked so happy.
She called over all her church sisters and showed them the beautiful gold ring. Now, she said, she
could fully give her life to the Lord and stop living in sin. From that moment on, Grandfather could

do no wrong.

Then not one day they can’t let me out of this room? Not one day? Why they have to paint the
walls this garish white? Nurse sometimes comes and takes me out of this room. We go down the
narrow hallway to the small recreational room. What a place! All types of women there: young
women, old women, black women, brown women, even one white woman huddled in the corner,
hugging herself and constantly rocking. Some of the women sit together in groups, while others sat
by themselves. I never spoke to anyone, and would back away, screaming, if anyone tried talking to
me. I much preferred it outside. The hospital grounds where Nurse would take me, every now and
again, to stretch my legs. The blue sea water rushing up to the beach. The many Lignum Vitae trees,
with seats under them, where the hospital staff often had lunch. Nurse and I often sat under one of
the trees and talked.

“Nurse, when am I going to go home?”

“Soon, Tia.”

“But I been here so many months already!” I said, getting upset.

“Don’t get agitated, Tia. Once you're calm enough you will get to go home.”
