The truth of the matter is, I never saw anyone who got to go home, and it was making me
nervous. In fact, the only people who I ever saw leave the hospital were those whose parents came
and signed them out. Since no one ever came to visit me, it didn’t look like I was ever going to get

home. Home. Home. I want to go home.

Grandfather would not stop touching me. Every day I was more and more afraid. Grandfather
pinched me on my breasts, sometimes even pulling on them, saying he was helping my breasts to
gtow. God, it was awful! Grandfather would breathe really hard, like some strange wild animal.

Although Mama and Grandy must have known what was going on, must have seen the
touching and the pinching, neither of them said anything. Grandy spent all her time with her
fingers outstretched, looking at her wedding ring, and Mama seemed as if she always had some-
thing on her mind.

I was so afraid of what Grandfather would do next, that one day when Daddy came to visit I
couldn’t take it anymore, and told him what was going on.

At first I thought Daddy was upset with me, because he pulled away so fast. He started walking
back and forth, mumbling to himself. What had I done?

“T will kill him.” Daddy said finally, in a very quiet, resolute voice.

“I will kill him,” he said a little louder, getting angry.

“I am going to KILL him,” Daddy roared, rushing out of the house to the back yard for a machéte.

I came to my senses and dashed into Grandfather's room and told him to run because Daddy was
coming to kill him. I didn’t want my grandfather dead, and neither did I want my father to face the
hangman. And whoever knew that Grandfather could run like that? He took off down the road,
Daddy hot on his tail. Grandfather ran straight to Busha Browne’s yard, which was when Daddy
stopped chasing him.

Daddy turned around and came back into the yard. He held me tight. A small crowd started gath-
ering outside our gate. Grandy locked herself into the room, and Mama was cursing both me and
Daddy about the unnecessary shame and embarrassment we'd brought down on her. Daddy just kept
holding me tight.

“Let me tell you this one more time, because I don’t know if I'll have the chance to tell it to you
again,’ Daddy said, stroking my hair, “I always want you to know that your Daddy loves you. You
remember that always. Ok?”

I nodded my head, yes. I was crying so hard, I believed I would die for sure.

Busha Browne came shortly after that with a jeepload of men. They cornered Daddy, beat him
up, and put him in jail.
