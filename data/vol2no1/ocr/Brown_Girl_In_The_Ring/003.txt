Calabash

I hurried back to bed then, frightened for my father and wishing more than anything else that I
had a friend or somebody I could talk things over with. The next day at school during lunch break,
I met her, I was by myself under the almond tree watching the red ants climbing up and down the
thick dark trunk when I looked up and saw Nadine there smiling at me. I couldn't believe it at first
when I see this nice pretty girl with golden yellow hair and doll-blue eyes, smiling at me. She looked
just like one of the dolls I had seen in the stores at Bay. Nadine put her finger to her lips, telling me
to shush and not to make a sound. I promised her I would not tell anyone that I had met her.

It did not matter to me that no one else could see Nadine, because that meant no one could
take her away from me. From that moment on Nadine was my playmate and I was not lonely

anymore ...

My preity playmate,

come out and play with me.
Bring out your dolly things
Climb up the apple tree.
All along my rain-n-bow
into mty cellar door,

for jolly friends we are

forever and ever more

Nadine and I would go to the river and I would watch the water flow over my toes. Sometimes,
we would take old cans or mesh-wire with us and use it to catch groupie fish. We would set the mesh

small silvery fishes darting about in the cool green waters. If the day was very hot I would strip
down to my underwear and wade out into the waters and get a nice cooling off. Nadine never came

into the water with me.

You think I forget everything, right? Well I never forget that Grandfather used to work in Cuba
and whenever he was home for vacation he would give me money if I let him touch me. No, is lie
I’m telling. I never let him push his fingers inside me. Even my mother and my grandmother, when
I tell them what was going on, say I telling lies on Grandfather.

“Don't you see how the man build up the church in the district?” Mama asked me. “Don’t you see
the frame picture of the man in the church when him kneel in the river water and him baptized?
Why you must tell those lies, Tia? Suppose people hear you saying those things, Tia?”

Grandy could barely look at me. She acted as if the very sight of me was distasteful. She had
only just recently married my grandfather, and he could do no wrong.

Most people believed my grandparents had always been married, because they had been living
