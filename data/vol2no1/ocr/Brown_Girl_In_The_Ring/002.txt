run and hide when they hear Nurse coming. Plus anything would ‘fraid for someone who always
come into the room with a needle in her hands. Why she must always come with the needle up
in the air like that? Always telling me that I need medication to calm me down. Why she can’t
come and stay for a moment so that she too could see the rats. Yes, I understand that she have
other patients, but still...

Me and Nadine used to be good friends you know, yes, me and Nadine was the best of friends.
Before 1 met Nadine I was the loneliest person in the world, especially at school where I had no
friends and no one played with me. At recess, best friends would play ring-games together and I
would hang around hoping someone would ask me to play with them. Then I would get to be “it”,
I would become the brown girl in the ring. But nobody ever asked me to play. The most popular
girls at school were the light-skinned girls and I wished I was pretty like those girls. I knew that if
I was as pretty as those girls I would have lots of friends, and all the boys would spend their lunch
money to buy me peppermint sweetie. I didn’t have any friends because of how black I am. The
other girls used to say I am blue-black.

There was one boy more than all the others that I really liked, a tall skinny boy that was as lean
as one of the young green bamboo trees down by the river. His name was Logan Palmer. Whenever
I saw him I would smile, but he would pass as if he hadn’t seen me and rush after one of the brown-
skinned girls. He lived in the big house on the hill. His father owned the most land in the entire
parish and sat on the City Council. This man and Grandfather were good friends. Whenever
Grandfather came home for holiday from his job in Cuba, this man, Busha, would drive his van up
to our house and he and Grandfather would spend hours each night on the verandah, drinking white
rum, smoking Cuban cigars, and talking. Once I heard them talking about my father. Grandfather
was saying that Daddy was having way too much influence over Mama, putting that black-is-beau-
tiful-rasta-thinking in her head. I crawled behind the door, listening to them talk.

“That boy too proud for his own good,” Busha said, “I have a mind to bring him down to size.”

“I keeping a close eye on him my own self,” Grandfather said, “for I never did like him, much too
dark.”

“And prideful.” Busha said.

“Yes, prideful.” Grandfather agreed. “But you know he is from Kingston, and everybody said his
parents were followers of that Marcus Garvey — fill his head with that Black pride talk, let him
believe he’s a natural boss-man or some such thing.”

“Well,” Busha cleared his throat, “There is only one boss-man around these parts, and you know
who that is!”

They clinked their glasses and started to laugh.
