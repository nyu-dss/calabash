You see, when I was born I was a nice brown-skin girl, but the sun burn me up and that’s why
I'm black now. What a ugly color black is, ee? Why God had to make such a color? You hear them
again, those damn blasted people in my head. Telling me that I’m black and ugly; that I’m useless to
society and better off dead. Like I tell everybody, this is not the real me. The real me is covered up
under all of this blackness. The real me is a nice brown skin girl.

Brown, girl in the ring

Brown girl in the ring

Nobody never pick me for “it” you know, no, nobody never pick me for the brown girl in the
ring. And I never cry about this at night when I come home from school. And I never see a little girl
curled up inside me covered up with sores. No, none of this never happened.

You see my mother, she is the prettiest woman in the world. Her skin is black like coal and her
eyes are black-black too. Mama rise before sun everyday and go and milk her cow. Industry — that
is my mother name. Mama tie her head with a bright red handkerchief, and her green and yellow
market dress is full of banana stains. And the way Mama kotch that basket on her head and walk
down that hill to catch the early morning bus to market. But you think life is a hill though why I
must always be trudging up and up? But life may well be a hill you know.

You see that damn rat bothering me again! Look how him side teeth growing long! What you
saying, Mr. Rat? You're going suck out all of my blood? If you think I’m going to just sit here
and let you suck out all of my blood you can guess again. Stop right where you are, Mr. Rat! Stay
right there! Do not take one step closer to me! Anyway, see Nurse coming here, a needle can take
care of anything. Think you badder than needle stick? As soon as you get that needle in your
arms watch and see how darkness going cover you like volcano ash. Yes, stay right there Mr. Rat,
until Nurse come.
