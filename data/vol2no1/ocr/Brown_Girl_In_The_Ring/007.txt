No Nadine, I not going play with you anymore; if you don’t let me comb your hair. I can drops
curls well good you know, Nadine, and the way your hair silky and golden the curls will look just
beautiful in the sun, and all the boys will chase after you. Then Nadine, why my mother must always
tell me to stop talking to you? Why she must keep saying nobody in the district don’t name Nadine
Kong? Why when I tell her that you carry me to the river to paint pictures of my naked body, she
must say is nasty thought filling up my head causing me to act so strange?

Nadine, remember that time you set up the easels and tell me to sit with my back to the river,
across from the wild Red Ginger plants? Lord, what a plant fiery red! It red like the handkerchief
Mama wear on her head. Prostitute red, Mama call it. Mama say anybody that can have a whole
dress make out of that color must be a streetwalker. Then Nadine, what is a streetwalker?

I was walking down the street one day
when I look up and see a boy

Hey Frankie!

Do you remember me, Frankie?

Do you remember meeeee!

You see how I can sing though! And Mama didn’t have to burst my lip when I sing that song. All
that blood. Blood. You know I ‘fraid bad for blood, Nadine? Then Nadine, why when you bend over
the river I don’t see your reflection? You smart, eeh Nadine, not to have a shadow. How you do it?
Whisper in my ears and tell me the secret. You know I used to hide from my shadow, Nadine? I used
to hop from tree to tree and hide from my shadow when Mama send me to the shop to buy some-
thing. I used to curl up and hide behind bush and stone, and I used to get ‘fraid when my shadow
go before me, or if it get bigger than me. Mama box my ears one day and say my shadow is not
something to make fun of, and suppose somebody thief my shadow, then what would I do? So
where your shadow, Nadine? ... Nadine? But is where that girl gone?

What you mean, who I’m talking to, Nurse? You don’t see the man in the comer in the full white
with the Cuban cigar in him mouth? Something wrong with your eyes, Nurse; you don't see the
white man in the comer with the blue eyes? (Is jealous she jealous you know, she can’t believe a white
man could love me.) Well, is me him come to visit Nurse, and not you, do you mind? No, I don’t
want that needle into me hands. If you come in here, Nurse, and try to put that needle into my hand
it going to be war. Yes, go and get the Security Guard, for I don’t know what kind of security him
providing. All the women that “escape” while that Security Guard on duty.

You hear them again, those damn blasted people talking in my head! Telling me how ugly I am.
Why you all don’t stop it? Logan Palmer did not say I was too black and ugly for him! Logan Palmer
