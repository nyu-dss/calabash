“So you must understand, we cannot have you in your condition in our school,” she said.

Then she reached over and touched my arm, and asked: “Child, who did this to you? Tell me,
who did this to you?”

I felt as if cotton was stuffed down my throat and I couldn’t talk.

And you can still hear the baby crying, right? That baby started crying as soon as Sister stopped
talking, and it cried for the long months that I was home. Although it was not born yet, the baby
just kept crying and crying, adding even more confusion to the voices in my head. I wanted to find
a place to go where the voices could not get to me, and that’s what I was trying to find when I
climbed the apple tree. Is fall I fall out of that apple tree, I wasn’t trying to jump. I didn’t see Nadine
at the bottom of the apple tree saying, “Jump nuh, Tia, jump nuh I'll catch you, just jump, Tia.” I
never jump and break my hands and foots and start bleeding out that baby. No, I never jump and
stop that baby crying. Mama never slap me in my face when I was in the hospital and ask what
kind of idiot I am to be jumping out of the apple tree knowing my condition. Granny never ask
me how I could be evil and wicked to be telling all those lies about her husband. The Nurse and
the doctors never tell me to just forgive and forget what my grandfather had done. No, none of
that never happened.

What you say, I have a visitor, Nurse? Then who could this visitor be? Let me just reach under
this bed for my slippers, put on my dress, and put some rouge on my cheeks.

OK, Nurse, I'm right behind you down this narrow hallway.

Daddy! Oh my God, it’s Daddy! It really-really is Daddy. Daddy you really come like your letter
said you would. Just you look at you, Daddy, your hair starting to gray, but not too much; you tall
and dark the same way, but much skinnier.

Then why you crying Daddy?

And why you crying too Nurse?

(Is my fault why they’re crying you know!)

Nurse stop that, you making me feel ashamed, telling Daddy all about what a wonderful young
lady I am.

Then, Daddy you bring all of these fruits for me: tangerine, naseberry, custard apple, and star
apple.

Then, Daddy, why you crying so hard? Of course I am still your little girl.

Daddy, between me and you, is people do me like this you know.

Then, Daddy, what wrong with me causing you to cry so hard?

Don’t mention my mother or her generation to you?
OK, Daddy.
