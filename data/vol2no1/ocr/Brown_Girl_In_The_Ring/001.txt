Brown Girl In The Ring

URSE COME TO MY ROOM EARLY THIS MORNING TELLING ME I HAVE
N a letter from my father and didn’t I want to wake up and read what my father was writing to
me to say as I am always going on about how my father will come one day to take me out of this
mad-house just as soon as he knows where to find me. Nurse said she knew the letter was from my
father because the envelope had Nelson Aiken on the outside.

I did not believe a word Nurse said, because everyone knows how she can play when she is in
the mood. I think she playing with me again, saying I have a letter from my father only because she
want me to wake up and take my morning medication. The letter was from my father in truth, saying
he'd gotten my address ftom one of Mama’s church sisters who he paid to coax it out of Mama.
That he was coming to see me and take me out of this place if it’s the last thing he does do.

And I'm crying really hard as I read the letter, thankful that for once the voices that are always

hospital and not a single soul come to visit me — not Mama, not Grandfather, not even the one
Nadine who promised me she would never leave me and she would always be my friend. Some
friend she turned out to be, and Nurse is convinced she did me more harm than good.

I wasn't always like this you know; is people do me so. I was a bright bright girl going high
school in Kingston, and if you had ever seen me in my starched white uniform with the two red
ribbons in my hair, you would never believe is the same Tia Aiken trapped inside of this mad-
house today. But I know that whenever Daddy find out how Grandfather and Mama had me
committed to this place, Daddy is going to kill the two of them for sure; it wont be like the last
time when Daddy chased Grandfather down the street with a cutlass but didn’t catch him. This
time it will be different.

And Grandfather will surely deserve whatever Daddy do to him, because it is his fault why I'm in
this hospital today. It is Grandfather fault why I get pregnant and my baby died, even though he
keeps telling all those lies that he was not the father of my baby. He knows full well that he was.
But that is such a jumbled-up and confused story that whenever I try to tell it, it never comes out
straight. I never know where to start from in telling that story or where to end. As soon as I start
