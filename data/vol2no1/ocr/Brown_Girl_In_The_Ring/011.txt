Yes now, Spanish Town, Nurse never believe me when I tell her that the black buds mean hurri-
cane. See it there now, see the sea-water rising, see the storm coming. Shhh! Daddy, how you get
into the room? You bribe that Security Guard. Ok Daddy I’m going to collect all my things and |
wont talk anymore; Ok, Ok, I’m only going to take only the most essential things with me. Daddy,
you are soaking wet from that rain outside — Ok, Ok, not another sound, not another pip you'll
hear out of me, Daddy, except, can I be “it”, Daddy, can I be the brown girl in the ring?
