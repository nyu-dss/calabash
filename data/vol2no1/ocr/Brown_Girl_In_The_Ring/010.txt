You going to take me out of this place if it’s the last thing you do?

OK, Daddy.

Then, Daddy, you bring all of these things for me, for meeeee, Daddy? Panties, brassieres, slip-
pers, nightgown, lotion, hair oil, comb, and, shhh! pads!

And you pay Nurse money to comb my hair.

It sure is nice to see you, Daddy.

When I see my blood that first time I think I was deading for true you know, Nurse. I think every-
thing Grandfather tell me would happen to me if I told anyone what was going on between us,
began to happen for real.

“Tia”, Grandfather said, “You see what happened to your father when you told him about us.”

I listened to Grandfather with my heads bowed, playing with my toes.

“You see how much power I by myself have, Tia — you will never see that father of yours again.”

This time my eyes filled with tears. More than anything else in the world I wanted to see Daddy
again.

“Well, “ Grandfather continued, “if you open that mouth of yours and talk about us to anybody
again, I will make sure that something bad happen to your mother and your grandmother. You hear
me, Tia? Something bad, bad, to both of them.”

I swear the man turned into a snake before my eyes! I swear he changed form.

And it hurt the first time you know, Nurse, it hurt so bad.

Nurse, why you have to twist and pull me head like that simply because you combing it, it hot
you know!

Yes, I want to look good for when my father come back, but you have to take it easy with my
hair. Yes, I know is my own fault why my hair is like this now, and yes I agree that you tried to comb
it several times last week, but I wouldn’t let you, still, please have little mercy!

Yes, that is much-much better, Nurse.

And Nurse, why Daddy was just there looking on me, shaking his head and crying?

“Look my daughter, my nice-nice chile, just you look what those heathens do to my child. But
never you mind, Tia, because if it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to take you out of this place. I’m
going to take you home. Ill take care of you now Tia.”

You know, when I was a little girl I wanted to be a painter, Nurse. You know, if I had some paints
now what I would paint? I would paint a dark skin girl in a light blue dress with big red ribbons in
her hair. I would give my painting to my Daddy. You think him really coming to get me like him
say, Nurse? I promise to take my medication every day, and I won't give Daddy any problems.
