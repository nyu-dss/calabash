Calabash

For you, flight is given as gift of bird messenger sustained
by rattle, by drum, by song. You soar, sail, glide.
For a brief moment you gain Sunâ€™s nod.

You are Bird itself. But know: such ecstasy is not forever.
You will reenter your world, but let down lightly
cradled as gently as egg.
