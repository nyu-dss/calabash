Parrot Music Box

Lovebirds come in all colors, their bodies
poised on strings knotted with beads, bells,

mirrors and hoops. At the pet store, two perform
inside an elaborate cage, unpredictable bobbles

bring oooohs and abhbbhs as spectators watch outside.
Frontal red bands, yellow under-parts washed through

with orange, ruby cheek patches, an olive-green rump,
tail feathers patterned by pink, rich gold flecked with deep

blue or black. We presume they must be cousins, no matter
how many times removed. They coo, trilling excitably

like flutes, feathers dazzled with song.
We want Mozart or “Yankee Doodle Dandy”

but from nowhere, they warble a working woman's lament:
Maria solo trabaja, solo trabaja, y su trabaja es ajeno. . .

The parrots pose with their beaks locked, skyward, in a kiss.
Spinning sound into their own idiosyncratic riffs: kwink

qua, kraar, caark, kweek, chissik-chissik, frveep-fweep.
We do not know how to make sense of it, this music

mixed of melody and noise. Brio in one language comes
out brash to another, untranslatable commotion.

The little birds look out dead-eye through the cage—
we want them to mimic us, sing: Pretty girl, pretty girl.
