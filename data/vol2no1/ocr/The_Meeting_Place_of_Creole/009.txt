Africans. It’s interesting how people have seen this area as the African domain.
When you look at it, it’s not the African domain at all, its where Africans have had
tremendous struggle. In the area of sports it was different in the old days because
sports set up rules. If you read C. L. R. James’ Beyond A Boundary, you see that there
are rules of engagement, and no matter who you are or your social position, if you
were playing the game, these were the rules. And within this framework, we would
see who would win the match. Now, who was chosen for the team and played in
the match was another story. But overall, sport was an area in which people felt they
were expressing their being, their Selves.

Now if you consider a time like the 1970s, when black people declared that
Independence was not working because black people are being discriminated
against in the very society that has a black government, no real change has taken
place. Around this time, Black Power was a call, not to separatism, but to society as
a whole, saying: this society must allow black people access to power. This society
must allow for black dignity; we demand black dignity in this meeting place of
culture. We don’t require it in separate villages where people can say: okay, we are
black and over here by ourselves and you can stay over there by yourself. It’s within
the open society that this struggle has to take place. I think what has happened is
that people have retreated from the meeting place and gone off into little enclaves
and have sought their empowerment, almost cut off from this central place.

I think this is the problem in Trinidad and Tobago. And it’s a problem because
nobody has maintained the ideals of justice, fair play, and dignity for everyone
within the meeting place of cultures. People are talking about Indian culture over
on one side and African culture on the other. With this approach, African culture
cannot carry itself forward (in economic and cultural terms) in any way that I can
see. On Emancipation Day in Trinidad, I didn’t see an Indian. Where is the meeting
place? Where do we meet? Certainly, Emancipation Day has to be a meeting place,

because emancipation is about seeking to liberate this society.

PS: Well, that is definitely a good point. Emancipation symbolized a move forward in
cultural, economic, and political terms for the entire country. Its effects extended
beyond the African population. Indians, Chinese, and many other migrant laborers
saw the benefits as well as the uncertainties that came with emancipation. It
certainly had a larger impact on the entire country; its effects cut across class, race,

gender, and ethnicity.
