clarifying the desired position as the country proceeds. In this context, Salt doesn’t
begin with the same ground as Dragon.

Different ground, yes, but certainly a continuous effort to sort out the cultural and
political challenges facing these communities. This effort takes a variety of forms in
your novels, particularly in The Wine of Astonishment, The Dragon Cant Dance, and
then again in Salt. There seems to be a persistence and commitment to this project,

wouldn't you say? Why is this?

Yes, there is a continued effort to sort through the issues of culture, identity, and
politics. Both texts try to deal frontally with Creole culture, looking back at times
to see how we've arrived at this point and what we can learn from it. One of the
major differences in Sa/t that pulls it in a different direction from Dragon is the ques-

tion of reparations. This is one of many questions raised.

Throughout Salt, there is a kind of tenuousness or skepticism about how people will
respond to the question of Reparations. What produces this skepticism, and is it a
productive skepticism?

The question of reparations is one that I've been dealing with for a very long time
now. In fact, I was one of the first people to articulate this question publicly here in
Trinidad, and two Afro-Trinidadians were the first people to respond negatively.
This didn’t surprise me.

Why didn’t this surprise you? What were some of your expectations when you first
raised this issue? And how did you respond to skeptics on this issue?

Well, in the novel I make it clear that reparations are something that is absolutely
necessary. In fact the novel anticipates these responses, it expects a resistance to the
idea because the society is not ready. In fact, they’ve never been ready. They didn’t
have reparations when they should have had it, and the communities have had to
live with this and they continue to do so until today. So the novel examines why
this skepticism is there, what functions it serves, what drives it. When we begin to
face this question of reparations, it requires people to give up a lot. People don’t
want to give up either victimhood or power as oppressors, or both, since the two
are not exclusive. And also, people don’t feel the sense of loss involved in the insti-
tution of slavery.

I feel there has been so much of an effort to distract people from this sense of
