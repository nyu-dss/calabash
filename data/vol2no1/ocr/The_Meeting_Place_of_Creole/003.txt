symbolizes in relation to the whole country that refuses to recognize the plight of
people in the yards. Pariag comes to join, requiring himself to be a part of the yard.
He brings a bicycle, not understanding the values within the community of the Hill,
and this conflict emerges out of a conflict between material possession or material

culture and spiritual struggle or spiritual culture.

PS: In Salt, there is an effort to locate cultural practices that can represent the complexity
of the communities, much in the same manner as Aldrick’s Dragon. Why is this
effort such a central part of your novels? How do these efforts speak to the need to
articulate a “national” culture in spite of the complex histories that are the fabric of

a country such as Trinidad and Tobago?

EL: In Dragon, there is a different notion of community. Pariag, for example, makes an
effort to join the Creole culture, in spite of the cultural tensions and misunder-
standings. In Salt, however, we don’t see Creole culture in the same way. We see
people more concerned with looking back at themselves now in terms of ethnic
culture, African culture. There is a retracing of steps, returning to emancipation and
its effects on Africans in the Caribbean and coming forward from there. We see that
it was an ironic emancipation that emancipated people into nothingness. In the case
of Indians in Trinidad, there is a similar return to their cultural heritage in India and
moving toward the political struggles of today within the framework of, not
necessarily A nationalist party, but different nationalist parties. Not necessarily
nationalist either, but different parties in which winning means having to assume
some kind of a nationalist agenda.

Look at the situation in Trinidad today with the UNC (United National
Congress) in power, an “Indian party” that now has to become a “nationalist” party.
Not the nationalism of the PNM (People National Movement) in its early days
when it stood by itself almost. Any party that wins an election in Trinidad has to
put itself forth as a nationalist party,

PS: So it sounds as though the nationalism to which you refer has to be a very broad-

based nationalism. More like a nationalism capable of maintaining itself in the face
of and with the support of competing nationalisms that are struggling to make

themselves seen and heard. This is a pretty formidable task, wouldn’t you agree?

EL: This is a very good point and a very good way of characterizing the situation. Yes,

each of these nationalisms brings different ideas, expectations, each adding and
