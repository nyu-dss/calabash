Speaking of Carnival, what are your views on the push to commodification, or as
some would say, “globalization,” of Trinidad Carnival? What does it mean to have
Trinidad Carnival, say, in the Canada, London, or the United States? For example,
in New York City, the Carnival takes place just before or around Labor Day. I find
this Carnival very interesting because it has been transformed from an essentially
Trinidad Carnival to a pan-Caribbean cultural celebration. There is an amalgama-
tion of floats, ole mas costumes, steel bands, mud bands, Puerto Rican and Cuban
music, Jamaican dancehall music, and so on. And of course, we cannot miss the
irony involved, since the Carnival draws millions of Latin American and Caribbean
people and their American-born descendants to New York City. This year, there
were more than 2 million people in attendance. Caribbean people comprise a rather
large population of laborers that have migrated to the United States, a trend that
dates as far back as the early 1900s. So, one the one hand you have the Labor Day
parade celebrating America’s laborers, but in a very different cultural context, in a

more commercial context I would say.

This is a very interesting observation you're making, and an important one too. The
idea of Carnival is about people becoming other things. We have to ask ourselves:
what are the identities of all of these becomings? People play mas in Carnival, put
on masks, hide their Selves and try on new ones, whatever they may be. For
example, when you consider a person playing a Roman soldier or Buccaneer, it’s
not that they are wedded to this mas or even that sensibility. It’s the fundamental
peopleness that is in progress in playing mas. And it is this aspect of the Carnival
that is so valuable for this region, because the same thing the Carnival does in New
York, it is doing in London. Very recently I came to look at the word “identity” in

a new way. I was thinking about whether you could choose who you are.

But even in choosing, we have to ask ourselves what the choices we make mean for
our lived experiences. For example, in my case, I was born here in Trinidad, but have
been living abroad for a long time. When I say I choose to be a West Indian, I have
to think about what this means while I’m here in Trinidad and how does this choice

translate once I am in the United States?

Well, what is important in these choices is how they affect the way you live. You
would have to ask yourself what center you choose to live from. If you say you

choose to be a Caribbean person, you're saying that you don’t want to be associ-
