violation. They lose their relationship or connection to the very rules by which
people are supposed to live, the rules which govern human beings. The violated lose
trust, respect and confidence in themselves and in the person who has violated them.
The gesture, therefore, while it cannot undo the harm, is offered in an effort to
restore in the violated (and the violator) some sense of faith, respect, and revalua-

tion of the relationship.

This is a very important distinction you are making here. It really recasts the terms
of this debate in a very different light. At a fundamental level, it boils down to a
valuing of human relationships. The monetary aspects of reparations have grabbed
the headlines where this discussion is concerned. But your approach speaks to a
much more spiritual process, a process of self-revaluation that must take place in
order for there to be any movement in the direction of forgiveness. So, your

emphasis on the gesture is not about compensation, but about revaluation?

If this gesture is not made, the injured party can sy to continue in the relationship.
However, no matter how much they tell themselves they have moved on, the fact of
the matter is they will always know that they have devalued themselves by
accepting that violation against their person as par for the course. Thus, there is no
way Africans could ever accept the enslavement of Africans, the brutality involved
in the process and all of the other atrocities.

There is another aspect of the absence of the gesture that has to do with the
nature of the relationship between the two parties once both realize that there
is no reparation forthcoming. In this specific instance, black people have been
further violated in order to justify the absence of the gesture, to assuage any
guilt and responsibility of the Europeans. In our case, itâ€™s not even about a
historical past, but its about the ongoing violation that is taking place today. The
practice of presenting people with negative images of themselves is a violation
of that Self. This is a violation that affects black people and white people alike
because it is a contrived image. If you look closely at media representations of
black people globally, the association of blackness with disaster throughout is

very commonplace.

As I am listening to your perspectives on the issue of reparation, I have to consider
them in light of our earlier discussions about culture. What, then, in light of these

representations, is the role or import of culture for effecting social change in this
