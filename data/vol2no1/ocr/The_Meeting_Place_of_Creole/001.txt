The Meeting Place of Creole Culture:

A GCONWYWERSATION WETEH EARLE LOVELACE

ORN IN TOCO, TRINIDAD, EARL LOVELACE HAS REMAINED A CONSISTENT
B purveyor of the cultural and political landscape of Trinidad for over forty years, bringing his
own brand of social commentary to reading audiences in the Caribbean, Canada, Europe, and the
United States. Lovelace is author of several novels, including While Gods Are Falling, The Schoolmaster,
The Wine of Astonishment, The Dragon Can't Dance, and a collection of plays entitled Jestina’s Calypso.
His most recent novel, Salt, won the Commonwealth Writers Prize in 1997, a prize given annually
for the best book in the English-speaking family of nations. However, to appreciate Lovelace’s
contributions to Caribbean literature, one would have to understand the social and cultural milieu
from which his perspectives and creative insights are borne and take shape. Recently, I sat down with
Mr. Lovelace to discuss how the cultural and political perspectives in his last novel, Sa/t, compared
to those expressed by his protagonists in The Dragon Cant Dance. Our opening discussion revealed
(once again) a long-standing insistence on the value of personal investment that I have come to
respect in Earl Lovelace and his work. Rather than settling for the pursuits of academic curiosity,
Lovelace put a very intriguing question to me as we started this conversation: he asked about my
investment in reading his works, what questions they raised for me and why. These questions, he
said, would be the basis for our conversation, since they were indeed the things that interested him
most in this process, not the academic exercise of talking about his writing. Though the question
caught me off guard, it created a space for me to come to appreciate the extent to which Earl
Lovelace makes himself and his reading audience accountable in the practice of (to borrow his
phrase) “cultivating culture.”

Lovelace’s critical perspectives on post-independence nationalism and cultural identity in Trinidad
have informed my own scholarly work in Caribbean literature through his dogged persistence about
the relationship between cultural expression and social transformation. Our conversation, therefore,
began with this observation and extended into a very candid discussion about culture, identity, repa-
ration(s), and racial politics in Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, and other parts of the Black

Diaspora. As is evident in Lovelace’s responses, his views on these issues reflect a critical perspective
