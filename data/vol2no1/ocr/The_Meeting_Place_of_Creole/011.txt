larger population, to the others in the society, about this cultural experience. So it’s

not really for the benefit (solely) of those who arrived.

EL: Precisely. 1 have never been invited to attend any of the Indian Arrival Day cele-
brations. Indians aren’t usually invited to participate in Emancipation Day unless
they are invited as officials of government. I’m hoping that we will get to the point
where these two celebrations, as cultural expressions, will become more of a cultural
meeting place. If we leave people, as we have, to go to the little enclaves, then they
cultivate the most self-serving aspects of our communities. There is no challenge in
the enclaves. It is through the challenges that we work out things with others in the
community. You see, the enclaves are too comfortable and comforting and this space
is not really a home. In an instance such as this, what we are doing is using part of
ourselves to express our whole Selves. No matter how large the piece, it is not the

whole, so it’s not our whole Self.

PS: When we think about expressing Self through cultural representations, we see the
significance of images for making sense of our worlds. What do you think about
Carnival as a cultural meeting place? Has the separatism affected Carnival in such a

way as to prevent it from serving this purpose?

EL: Carnival is a way of presenting the idea of your Self. But remember, this is not your
whole Self. If you think about the dragon within the context of the entire mas’, the
Dragon might be the central idea of struggle within all of the pretty mas taking
place around it. When you take that away, when the dragon goes the way of the
middle class, it no longer carries the history and experiences of people on the
people of the Hill. In taking over some of these figures, the middle class strips the
figures of the spirit of rebellion in order to “play” the dragon mas.’ One might ask,
could Peter Minshall bring a dragon? As I think about this, I saw his RED, and it
make me think of the dragon, the spirit of rebellion. It would be interesting to see
how different people play Dragon, how middle class people would play it, how
different artists would play a dragon.

PS: So, are you saying that what goes into the Dragon, the fabric, colors, size, move-

ments, is part of the lived reality of those represented by the dragon?

EL: Yes, this is precisely what I mean when I ask: can someone play a dragon? Can they

carry all of the symbols, meanings, and histories, and dance the dragon?
