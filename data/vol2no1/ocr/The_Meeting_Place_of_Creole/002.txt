informed by a pre-independence sensibility to the possibilities of a nation poised to redefine itself
and its cultural, political and economic relationships to the world. However, this sensibility, like the
writer it produced, is tempered by the frustration of post-independence, the Eric Williams era in
Trinidad and Tobago, the Black Power Movement, the 1990 coup attempt, and the current tense
political and cultural climate in Trinidad and Tobago. My point of entry, therefore, considered the
changes in the cultural and political climates of The Dragon Cant Dance and Salt and how, if at all,
these changes are reflected in the relationships within the communities represented in these novels, In
the following discussion, one can begin to appreciate Lovelace’s insights on the far-reaching implica-

tions of how we translate and experience selfhood, community, and culture in a Caribbean context.

In both The Dragon Cant Dance and Salt, there is a focus on the importance of
community in shaping nationalist politics in the Caribbean. However, there seems to
be a more optimistic view of Caribbean community and “local” politics in Salt than
was represented in The Dragon Cant Dance. What accounts for the changes in the

communities, and what encouraged this optimism in your writing?

In The Dragon, the people on the Hill had just gone through the experience of the
1970s, a newly independent country and the frustrations with the failure of

independence to improve the lives of the common man. As I think about it actually,

I would not say that the novel is really “optimistic” in its scope.

PS: The Dragon is set in a period of experimentation as the people on the Hill (Aldrick
and Pariag for example) are “trying their hand,” or testing the waters to see what
independence will mean for the ethnic, class, and gender stratifications in Trinidad.
This is the kind of tenuous optimism to which I’m referring here. Would you say
that uncertainty rather than optimism is what drives the community, whether in a
positive or negative manner? Or maybe I should say “the communities” because
there is an ongoing struggle within the “community” and the people who inhabit
this space.

EL; Creole culture is a meeting place in which both groups (Africans and Indians) are
seeking to enter this space with a sense of Being, Aldrick and the people in the yard
have been carrying on a longer struggle. He has become the “dragon” and all it
