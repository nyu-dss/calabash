EL; Africans didn’t need emancipation by themselves. If Africans were by themselves,
what would they need emancipation from? Emancipation is from something,
whether it was from servitude in the Caribbean as Indians to freedom from servi-
tude as Africans. Symbols of emancipation that are presented here are now about
various heroes in the Caribbean, about what has happened in Africa, having a

Sphinx, inviting African scholars to talk about the glory of the Nile.

PS: But wouldn't you say that these symbols are being erected in order to locate blacks
in relation to a specific source in a similar fashion to Indo-Trinidadians reconnecting

to India and Indian history and traditions?

EL; There are many ways you can define yourself. If I say that I am from nowhere, I am
a newborn person in the Caribbean; I have no specific line I can go back to, What
invalidates that? Everyone comes from somewhere, everyone is somebody, and
everybody requires respect. If Africa didn’t have the history it had, would that mean
we could kill Africans? If India didn’t have a long history, would that mean we
should punish them and put them under undue duress? I think that the basis on
which we engage in our existence as New World people, the most significant actu-
ally, is that we came here as ordinary people. We came as Africans stripped of name
and rank. Africa might claim us and we might claim Africa, but I don’t see a grand
necessity for that. I see more of a necessity in seeking to fight the battles in Africa,
not simply to shelter under the ancient history but to deal with what is happening
to Aftica and Africans today. It’s not enough to say I’m going to get my identity
from the Nile. We have to also get our identity from the thousands of hungry
people too, or homeless people, sick people. I’m not saying there wasn’t a time for
identifying with Africa; I was one of the first people to wear a dashiki in Trinidad.
Maybe it is because I went through that stage before that I’m taking this position.

PS: So, is it fair to say that this identification with Africa has served its purpose and run

its course as a political and cultural symbol?

EL; Africa continues to serve this purpose; it’s just not a place where one can stay. I'm
not trying to come down hard on what Emancipation Day is about; there is just a

lot more that needs to be done to make this one of the cultural meeting places.

PS: We can think about these same issues in the context of Indian Arrival Day. This,
like Emancipation Day, is a cultural manifestation that is supposed to speak to the
