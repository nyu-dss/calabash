arena? This kind of constant devaluation must have a long-lasting impact on the
psyches of people in this position. Can culture act as a buffer or counteract the

processes of devaluation taking place in the absence of a gesture?

EL: The constant, persistent processes of devaluing blackness are among the reasons so
many people of African descent are tenuous about the idea of reparation. You see,
in a situation such as the one we have right now, there is too much emphasis on
who will be paid, not who has been injured. But to return to your question of the
role of culture as an intervention in this process, I would ask you to note that so
much of black culture generally has been about affirmation of self. In the process
of trying to liberate oneself from this process, one also needs to affirm a self. Not
the Self that they tell you is yourself, but a Self. A good example of the impact of
this is the use of the term “slave.” Now, Africans have been enslaved; I think we
understand that. But still we must notice how the term persists; when blacks are
supposedly freed from slavery, they become a “ex-slaves.” So their designation now
becomes “slave”; they belong nowhere and they are nobody. Another example is
when you hear about the baseball player Jackie Robinson, who broke the color
barrier. They erected a color barrier; they removed the color barrier; so the
impression is given that there is some hoop that you have to jump through, some

hurdle that you have to overcome in order to be human.

PS: The example you just provided gives us a false sense of agency. If the person is
erecting the barrier is also taking it down, is it then a false sense of accomplish-

ment? So there is a limit to how much this person can be revalued?

EL: Precisely, Robinson didn’t erect a barrier; they put up a barrier against him and then
they took it down. What was the barrier that he broke? As long as things like that
continue, we will have a diminished sense of self. There are so many things that
continue to diminish people. So we are, to a large extent, living in what can be
called a culture on the defensive. We have to defend ourselves in what it means to
be human, affirming in order to defend.

PS: If we consider the importance of image-making, the role of the writer, painter, or
artist is a very important one, since they too are in the business of making and
disseminating images. What would be your charge, then, to writers in the Caribbean
as they engage in the processes of image-making or revaluing humanity? How, in
a place like Trinidad and Tobago, can an artist go about representing images that are
