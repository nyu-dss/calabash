so diverse, so multifarious in their cultural, social, and political meanings? Doesn’t

this make the idea of national culture difficult to sustain?

Well, when we think about culture we have to think about cultivation. One culti-
vates culture through practice; it’s a lived experience. But when you haven't done it
before, when you haven’t practiced it before in order to call it forth you might, for
example, put up a red ribbon on the door and walk four times around it before

entering the room, because this is your ancestral rite.

This is a very interesting way of thinking about cultural practices and how they take
on meaning through lived experiences. I am often amazed that when I am in the
US and begin to talk to Indian colleagues (from India, not the West Indies) about
things, words, or symbols that are considered “Indian” in Trinidad, they often
remark that they have never heard of such a thing, nor do they know what it means
or represents. These instances make me think very seriously about the role of
creativity and the imagination in, as you say, cultivating culture and cultural tradi-
tions. How then can we begin to parse through this plethora of cultural

significations to arrive at a common cultural meeting place?

People need to create. Actually, the need for people to create is an interesting one.
People go back (historically) even though they have no lived relationship to the
place, tradition, or space they are returning to. When we talk about “going back,”
it's a return to something we have a feel for; it is not something that is totally
foreign, per sé It’s not that things come from nowhere; there is some connection.
The return functions as an occasion for black people to say look, we come from
somewhere, and we didn’t arrive here culturally empty-handed. Then on the other
hand, you have Indians, who were always closer to India than we have been to
Africa. They have been able to maintain relationships because there were priests who
preserved the religious rights and other cultural practices. I think Africans have been
engaged in a meeting place of culture, which is Creole culture. This space hasn’t
been very kind to us, but it is the place where we've had to battle. It was in this
arena that steel-band was born and struggled, where the Shouter Baptists were
created and outlawed, Shango was created and put down, stick fighting banned, and
laws prohibiting what calypsonians could and could not sing about.

The Creole cultural area has been an arena where we have created and where we

have been pushed back in a kind of way. It was never a space that “belonged” to
