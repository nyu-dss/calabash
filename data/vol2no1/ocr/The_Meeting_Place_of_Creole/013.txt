ated with this world power, that you want to be part of a people entering a different
cultural meeting place. If you choose to be an American but are born in the
Caribbean, it doesn’t mean you are no longer a West Indian. It simply means that
your mind space includes a metropolitan, international perspective. It’s only in the
sense of choice and how you inhabit and articulate your self that I can really talk
about identity. Very often, people talk about black novelists writing about identity,
that their novels are about identity. What about white novels and novelists, aren’t
they also about identity? Do blacks have an identity that they lack, or vice versa?
These are some of the things the conclusion of Salt anticipates, all of these ques-

tions about identity and even the value of these questions.

EL: This has been a very engaging discussion. I’m not quite sure how to end it, as I think
we could go on talking about these issues for a long time still. However, as I know
you have other things on your plate, I want to thank you very much for taking the
time out to share and exchange ideas with me. I am eagerly anticipating your next

novel and look forward to sharing my thoughts with you about it.

EL: Well, yes, I’m working on something right now, but won't say much more than that
about it. But this has been a very good conversation and has given me the
opportunity to revisit some ideas and examine new approaches to some of them.
I wish you the best with the completion of your book and we will talk again soon.

?
Im sure.
