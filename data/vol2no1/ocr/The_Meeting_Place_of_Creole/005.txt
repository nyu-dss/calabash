loss, because facing it will mean dealing with the extent to which people have been
devalued. There is no sense of the value of people, and without this people cannot
move to the point of understanding their loss, what has been lost. There has been
a lot of discussion about designating a “day of forgiveness” for the atrocities of
slavery. But forgiveness doesn’t work in this context; it is not as simple as it seems.
If a person injures you, you cannot forgive that person until some kind of gesture
of amends is made for the damage that has been done. Forgiveness is not possible
otherwise. If you accept the injurious behavior without this act of reparations, then
what the injured party is saying is that they accept this kind of behavior for them-
selves or against their person. So it could never make sense to talk about forgiveness;

it can’t come up in this situation.

PS: Would you say, then, that some of the tenuousness around this issue has to do with
the difficulty and even fear of facing history? How can we begin to think about
the resistance to the idea of reparations without dealing first with the terror, if you
will, of the history of slavery? In fact, we have to think about this terror as having

implications for both the enslaved as well as slave owners, wouldn’t you agree?

EL: This is in large part what the book tries to address, But before we address that, there
is an important point people need to understand about this whole debate. There are
two terms that tend to get conflated in this discussion, reparation and reparations.
Reparations occur if a country looses a war, and then they have to pay compensation
to victims of the war. So you will notice that there have been reparations paid to
the Japanese and the Germans and so forth, all have lost wars. If you don’t lose a
war, you have nothing to pay anyone. So, people who have been victimized by the
victors of the war have no compensation to receive.

Now, in the case of reparation, this is more along the lines of an individual rela-
tionship, a human relationship. A good example of such an instance is when two
lovers are in a relationship and one party injures the other. The injuring party makes
some gesture to let the other person know that she/he is sorry and wants the
relationship to continue in spite of the injury or offence against the other party.
Often it might be something as simple as bringing flowers and saying “I’m sorry.”
This gesture suggests a starting-over, an effort to acknowledge the wrong but trying
to continue with the knowledge of the injury by both parties. In a situation where
there is a violation of anyone, both people lose. However, the violator and the
violated lose different things. The violator loses a sense of self in carrying out this
