The way a poem is laid on the page, its visual aspect, is as important as the sounds it evokes. Thus,
the rhythm is brought forth also by visual means — with poems sometimes taking the shape of
waves or wings. Words and verses are made clearer by their visual form. In “The SilverSands Poem,”
an alliterative long line is followed by an extremely short one, then by another pair of long and short
lines, making the “hurricane” and subsequent “silence” stand out in a clashing opposition, suggesting

the eternal contrast between sound and silence, word and lack thereof:

how is the sound of this south sea so soft
of the hurricane
how so in a hurry to alter the landscape . to let fish slip

under the silence

In the poem that closes the third section, “Xango at the Summer Solstice,” the contrast between
sound and silence becomes part of the continuous cycle of life: every winter X4ngo would store the
sounds that would be heard in another season and another place. Here is where language is created,

but also where

[...] beyond the language of the summer's clock-
work [...]
you will already see the shadows

Sounds are a communicative means, and as such they make up a language. Here, the poet/X4ngo
is creating both a poem and the language to express it. The blowing of air into the flute evokes in
our minds God breathing life into a piece of clay. Structurally, the poem is built on different
coexisting levels, not only of time and place, but also of language: We hear, here and now, the sound
that Xango created in another place in another time in another language. Different languages coexist
in the poem, and the continuous swinging from standard English to nation language and back brings
the reader closer to the process of creating a language.

In “The Nansetoura of CowPastor,” the function of memory and time and the significance of our
heritage in determining what we are today, is highlighted by the alternation of narrating voices —
the poet and Anancy the Spider. CowPastor, in Barbados, is where Kamau Brathwaite’s ancestors are
buried. It is the sacred place where memory brings the past into the present and Africa into the
Caribbean. Here and now, through the juxtaposition of voices, we also witness the transformation
of language into poetry — a nation poetry expressed in a nation language.

In other poems, Brathwaite’s use of ideograms and logograms strips language of its

embellishments and leaves it unadorned, naked in its true essence. Language becomes a tool, and can
