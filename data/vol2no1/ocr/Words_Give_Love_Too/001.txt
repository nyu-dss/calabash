A REVIEW OF KAMAU BRATHWAITE’S WORDS NEED LOVE TOO

De
Words Give Love Too

(St. Martin: House of Nehesi Press. 2000.)

AMAU BRATHWAITE’S Worps NEED LOVE TOO BELONGS IN THE POET'S GROUP
Ke works that examine the act of creation of language. It forces the reader to question the
function of language, to wonder how it is created and how it serves a writer’s purpose, and, above
all, to consider the relationship between a writer and his public — the community of readers who
are the recipients of his creation. These questions are of particular interest today, as in the current
globalized world, with its literary superhighways, words are shared by a much larger community
than in the past, and writers have less control over and perception of its size and composition.

Called upon to review this new collection of poems, a critic soon finds herself in need of new
words. The traditional critical tools would not do when reviewing such poems, written in part in the
language of the New World, that is, nation language, which expresses a cultural, geopolitical and
socio-historical diversity. Shedding her standard, self-referential stock of words, the reader is
compelled to withhold analysis and simply sit back and absorb the cascade of vowels and
consonants, images and associations. And after a while she feels as if she has landed on uncharted
virgin shores where no one has set foot before, beginning a voyage through time and space to face
up and acknowledge what was and what could have been. Each word and each poem is a new
statement, either a stone hurled to shatter an old consciousness or a brick in the construction of a

new one.

The collection, divided into four sections, is a major contribution to ‘Caribbean aesthetics’ and, as
such, might be a considerable challenge to the non-initiated. But Brathwaite’s poetry has never been
known to be easy reading. It requires the reader to make some adjustments — to cast off any ready-
made preconceptions and pre-constructed ideas and meanings. Yet once he opens up to the rhythm
on the page in front of him, he will be carried off to new levels of meaning. It is a rhythm made
of repetitions and alliterations, with no traditional line breaks (if you look for these here, you have

not made the requisite adjustments).
