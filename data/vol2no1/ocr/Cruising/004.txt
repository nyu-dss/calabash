are the unavoidable and overwhelming references of this period.

His own answer to these problems has been to take into consideration the changing face of urban
living, the small chances it offers for the development of minimal ethical principles, and the whole
thorny issue of the representation of the Caribbean: “It is with some of these thoughts that I started

to construct these repositories and emblems of our age which suggest that we are consumerist beings.
I had always looked at street vendors selling simple goods like sweets or a few spices etc. and
wondered how they managed to make a profit from such inexpensive products. It certainly affected
my own perception of what survival entails in a developing semi-urban context as is present in many
Caribbean islands. These works, in both form and content, mirror the boxes used by street vendors.
By embedding the sale items in transparent resin, I intend to create a capsulated object that suspends
in time images built from the simplest consumer objects from this era. Also, I explore and utilize the
very aesthetic presented by the vendors’ arrangements and sense of design. By connecting their
method of presentation to my own aesthetic decisions, I in some way seek to subvert and critique
the modes that have been applied when representing working and labour class people traditionally
in Caribbean art. The market woman (basket on head), the fisherman (glistening with sweat pulling
in his net on a beach), the shack on a hill with coconut trees, etc. have all been popular themes in
images from and about the Caribbean. These images now verge on being the clichés that are in use
the world over. As representations, they have been part of an external gaze, a highly exoticised and
distanced version of Caribbean reality. From that particular vantage point, there is little trace of
economic tensions, of the impact of tourism, or of the general dynamic of transformation. It does
not present this region and its inhabitants as part and participants in the growth and eventuality of
modern civilization, but as subjects viewed from a safe distance, voiceless. Unfortunately, many artists
in this region, especially in the visual arts, have adopted a language of limitations in which they
themselves have always been located in an imposed otherness.”” Lovelace thus reasserts the precari-
ousness of living and the inadequacy of a system that equates freedom with consumerism.

The solution he proposes is to juxtapose empty status-symbols and basic commodities:
“Superimposed in the foreground of these arrangements, I have placed luxury car logos constructed
from beans, rice, spices, and other edible foodstuffs. They make reference to a perceived ideal of
success and stature. Juxtaposing these emblems of wealth with the simple products sold on small
scale, I want to allude to the seemingly improbable gap between achieving material wealth and the
means we may have available to arrive at that ideal. By making the logos with food I seek to create
tension between the notions of consuming (food) to survive, saving to purchase, and purchasing to
become. Besides some of the conceptual concerns, the work also acknowledges an aesthetic that
permeates much of global popular culture. These forms and systems of design are created as much
by our need to express some mode of creative sensibility within the space around us, as by

consumerism and all it’ functional necessities of seduction/presentation as we buy, as we sell. It is
