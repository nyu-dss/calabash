on the other hand, it has amounted to a prickly but effective strategy for inclusion. Some of the work
centres on typical postcolonial issues of identity, history, and memory, but the most substantial work
is “post-issue” ,concerned with the complexities that have emerged from new life-styles, and often
from the consequences of physical and intellectual Diaspora (not new in itself, but there have been
unquestionable changes in the focusing of this experience). Its agenda is dialogic communication and
a critique of the systems of power and representation.

The very nature of the experience of writers and artists in the gos is increasingly cosmopolitan
and may oblige us to rethink Caribbean culture as a distinct body. It may well be that much of the
work is being produced for outside consumption and that there is an urgent need to counter the
Western metropolitan re-absorption and reconstruction of Caribbean art; just as it is inevitable that
some young artists have been appropriated or absorbed into the international canon on account of
their blackness, their otherness, that serves as one of the main focuses of their constructed image
for a white audience. Yet there are other factors at play whose consequences have been substantial.
It is precisely through the work of the artists who are living or have lived outside the Caribbean
that the essential postcolonial articulation of Diaspora, displacement, and ambivalence has found
its most critical voice. Their work is imbued with a transnational and transcontinental edge that
paradoxically makes it central, not peripheral, to contemporary experience. For example, Femi
Dawkins, the Jamaican artist who is living and working in Amsterdam and Los Angeles, notes about
his work that: “it focuses on cultural memory. For the past couple of years, I have been making
altars in and around my studio home. My intellectual obsessions are mainly to do with the Diaspora
of Africa and the Caribbean. ... I use found objects such as old Dutch wooden ironing boards to
create masks, thus playing with the idea of domesticity as oppression and of freedom. There are,
as we all know, many domestic servants all over the world toiling away ironing shirts, pants, and
dresses. So the idea of masks made ftom discarded ironing boards serves as a potent reminder of
the post-colonial era of oppression and of the silent patterns of faces that emerge from the toil,
steam, and sweat. My work is about autobiographical tales of alienation, of diasporal despair
calling for a change in direction, I live in a world filled with signs and ciphers that I manipulate to
form symbolic trophies of my own making.”!

Having said that, it is also equally true that many of the artists who are working within national
cultures are uncomfortably aware of the restrictions this places upon them. Christopher Cozier
notes ironically that there has been an obsession, in the 80s in Trinidad and in the gos all over
the Caribbean, with defining “d culture.” And asa result, other forms of response to the Caribbean
space have been viewed as suspicious: “the shift to process and method opens up the idea that the
boundary between what is defined as local and what is supposed to be foreign (alien to us) has
become unapologetically permeable and that the thematic and conceptual concerns of the artist

are not already fixed. So the contemporary space can be interpreted as an ongoing evaluative or
