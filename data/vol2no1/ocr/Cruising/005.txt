important to me that the work contributes and enriches two different languages. It creates an
exchange or meeting point for two situations, one which comes from a sense of immediacy and
survival, and the other which acknowledges the former and thereby starts to utilize a whole range
of signs and rituals in an act of artistic reflection. The resulting object accommodates some of the
dualities we find in modern existence. The objects adorn and question simultaneously. The moment
in which the viewer's reflection is caught in the mirror, which comprises the background of the
boxes, he/she becomes framed by objects that may have some utilitarian value to them, but from a
world of the low-tech retailer (in an increasingly hi-tech world). The work metaphorically places the
viewer into the box of the vendor and into his view of reality. Both a simple beauty and an intense
urgency.”* In other words, for young people in the Caribbean, local and global images exist side by
side; they interact and produce new dreams. Consumption can lead, on both an individual and
national level, to expansion, but also to negative psychological dependencies. The need is to develop
a new vision of what we want society to be and to realize that the culture industry is now a major
force in shaping consciousness and legitimating dominant social practices. The artist has to unlearn
and relearn what is means to challenge these systems.

Much of the work in the nineties stresses its links with the popular, with music, dance, craft, &
street speech, whose vitality forms and informs mind, eye, and body. I am thinking of Steve Oudett’s
installations that delve into the subtleties of language in Jamaica and of Cozier’s proximity to
popular forms:’I felt that I lived in a space outside of a clear narrative with a clear point of origin
& destination & point of arrival. So, as an artist, | began to wonder whether my work was defining
its own point of view and the means to articulate it, or whether the work was merely an illustration,
an interpretation of a given viewpoint. The work became symptomatic of my condition and circum-
stances and bewilderment and questioning. Like most artists of my generation living in Trinidad, the
popular forms captured my attention, the music, and the way people do things: the way, for instance,
we put things together — such as a kiosk on the street, a carnival costume or a Mas as we say.”® Yet,
Cozier correctly signals the incumbent danger of a topical ethnological illustrating of other as
opposed to an individual creative freedom: “However, a history of art was coming into being that
attempted to align my work to 19th-century anthropological paintings of property and native types.
There seemed to be some comfort with aligning oneself to those who render or display an ‘us’ rather
than allowing an ‘us’ to express what, in an individual sense, one of the ‘us’ might be thinking.”!°
Cozier’s point applies to both his own work and to the subtly poetic world of Eddie Bowen, about
whom he has also written. Bowen’s work emerges from the particularities of and movements within
his own experience. It is meditative and apart: pitched musically on a romantic minor but deeply
modulated key. And it is through the immediacy of drawing that serves as an intimate and economic
register for the speed and changes of thought that he best traces it. Bowen notes: “its formations can

be multi-dimensional in character, but for me drawing is more of an exercise in writing, and my
