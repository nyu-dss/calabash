study for many years has been a sustained action of concentration in many attitudes and styles. I
have made paintings for the same reasons, as a method or a vehicle for the expression and interpre-
tation/transformation of how I see my particular existence. In recent times, I have been drawn to
outsider art, which has had the effect of refreshing my approaches. The changes in scale from the
very detailed smaller drawing series, ‘The architect of impossible physics’, to the larger ‘Arenas’ is a
continuous effort to maintain an internal diversity and challenge necessary for continued experi-
mentation, expansion and entropy. The incorporation and study of yoga since 1993 has had a
profound effect on the nature of my work and life, whilst not immediately apparent it forms a
substratum of reference and experience that has affected my thought processes about my entire
activity as an artist and person.”'' The problem is to find the ways of effectively penetrating contem-
porary experience without necessarily having recourse to fashionable codes or dominant models, yet
at the same time, recognizing their inevitability.

Critique can, of course, also take place from inside, at the social, ethical, or spiritual levels, as when
Annalee Davis brings up the problem from her plantation background in Barbados of being too
white, or when Roberta Stoddard, in a highly accomplished pictoral language, opens an area of
human exchange between herself and the poor in Trinidad by literally establishing relationships
with her subjects (although one would have to look at what this relationship means from both sides
of the fence). In centering the poor, the outcast, the derailed, the destitute, the mad, she seeks not
only to underline the socio-economic problems, but also infuse into the work a transcendental push
towards the spiritual. These figures come from life around her and are the consequences of life
around her. Yet they are awash in their frantically constructed worlds and speak of the larger fail-
ures of our society to create models based on care and love. The empty white space around the image
is a meditative space where emotions move and gell. Stoddard challenges given ideas of normalcy,
the ideas of vagrancy within ourselves, of rejection of self and of others, the recognition that “many
of us experience our condition as painful, confusing and restricting.”"? One thinks of Foucault's
Histotre de la Folie, of the incorporation or rejection of atypical mental conditions inside or outside

the community.
