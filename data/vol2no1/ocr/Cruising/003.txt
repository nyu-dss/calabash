investigative look at the local, as well as the broader domain of artistic activity globally.”? In other
words, Cozier is arguing that the parameters of the work have gone beyond the criteria now being
applied to validate them. He thus asks: “Is artistic activity here just a shift within the same config-
uration, that is, impressing the elite at home while claiming to represent them abroad and waiting
to be discovered, redeemed and validated? How do we define its function?” The question is
intensely pertinent.

Che Lovelace moves directly to some equally central issues, arguing that the obligations of citi-
zenship are becoming increasingly defined through the imperatives of consumption and the
demands of the marketplace: “World economy in some regions is defined by a proliferation of super-
consumerist tendencies. Yet those same regions also see that very abundance of product and capital
barely trickle into particular communities, the survival strategies of low income communities become
part of the structure of modern civilization.”* The Caribbean tourist boom creates an upward mobile
economy for those associated with it and increasing poverty for the majority who have no access to
the bonanza. It leases the island for the abysmal pleasures of the tourist, who has little time or incli-
nation to understand what his presence actually produces. To what point, asks Lovelace, does the
artist, “along with the educated middle class in general, see and address these realities, both on a
moral humanitarian level and as participants in an appreciation of the aesthetic that these realities
engender?”’ Again and again we have seen works — ironic, patodic, playful, — dealing with the
clichés of the contamination of the dominant Western or American culture on the national. We are
now witnessing a turn away from the general to the particular and the growing recognition for both
an increased complexity and increased specificity in the referential field.

Lovelace continues, fully aware of the way in which the language of social responsibility has
become a major casualty of the dire conditions of contemporary life: “More and more we are
witnessing the gaps between what is accessible/affordable/ consumable. What is the construct of our
desires and ideals, and what are the means by which we have to achieve them? Our general fondness
for objects which are associated to status and material wealth has become very much the accepted halo
which guides our day-to-day existence. Economically and culturally, we have had to negotiate our
existence under a hegemony of larger states (even in the present independence that most Caribbean
states have now attained). What has marked the participation of these developing countries within the
global economic/cultural structure has been the dynamics of trade. Participation in a survival game
means consuming and being consumable.” It is an observation that raises many questions concerning
the loss of traditional values, the social costs of the marked drift towards consumerism, the vulnera-
bility to the impact of the multi-nationals, the lack of any alternative regional project, and implicitly
the nature of the relationship of art to such a problematics. Tourism, beach-life, night-life, airports,
tour operators, international shopping centres, land speculation, nouveau riche classes, consumerism,

together with unemployment, the dramas of an increasing poverty gap, survival economies, and drugs
