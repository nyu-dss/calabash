as

Colonizer

I want to make a map of you
trace your contours

pace the mountains and the valleys
scour the rough bushes, mark out
the smooth treeless plains.

I could make an archeological dig
into your oesophagus

through your heart

right to the very core of you.

I will scope your thoughts
scrape out your bowels
navigate the rivers of your blood.

I'll read my maps

use these surveyor's tools
take up pick

axe and chisel to scale
the pinnacle of you.

I'll plant my flag on your summit
retire these labours

turn hermit

and meditate on the

meaning of mapping you.
