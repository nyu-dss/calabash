RIDDLE NO. 2

Riddle me dis, riddle me dat, guess me dis riddle and p’raps not:

OTHERS WILL UNDERSTAND THIS: THE FIRST ONES I SENT INTO THE WORLD

did alright, turned out to be human. But this lot! Okay, perhaps I spoil them. Bearing them
now not solitary and naked like the first but many together, gift-wrapped in silky down and swad-
dling clothes of papery layer. I’ve overdone it, perhaps, in the way of security and comfort. For can
I get them to leave? Even when mature they continue to cling for dear life to me and — worse —
to each other. Unwrapped, without the light of day, they know they are useless but are still so shy,
they are prepared to die — together. To live, they must be forcibly undressed and separated. That’s
where my human children come in. Skilled at brutality, they will happily rip these children from me,
strip off their clothing, pull them apart. Because I know it’s for their own good I happily watch as
each little one pops out like a pearl. Ivory. Golden. Milky. Not all will stay that way. Some will be
dried, popped, parched, ground to be drunk or eaten. But I smile even as I am myself cut down as
spent and useless, for I know enough of my progeny will be saved to be planted and nurtured.
Become, in their turn, mothers proudly displaying their clinging children in their green array. The
little ones still attached to their mother, still clinging to one another; undercover, in the dark. Scared
of the single life. Yet dying for exposure. To grow up.

To ripen the germ of Sun Father.
