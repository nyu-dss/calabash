Calabash
scattered
my name buried by music
foreign to me
the mountain-sides bursting
in red
my gestures marooned

I have seen what will be

the mirroring gaze through time
the sun in eclipse

reflection and

reflection
an imprint
of my face
the study of
my aim

and my name will sow maize
my name will breed vision

my girls will be black, bronzed,
their eyes will be storms,

and my name dropped
golden leaf

flower
voice of gold
the gold

of mountains

beyond mountains

I've crossed

to behold my own face.
