... and my name will be dropped
golden leaf

flower
voice of gold

the gold

of mountains beyond mountains
I've crossed to behold my own

face
despite my body’s death
in double cross
(by a Spanish gentleman’s deal:
the sword/the crucifix)
despite divisions of time
of tribes Taino
Carib...
the island’s body itself
its zones:
Marien
Magua
Maguana Higuey
Xaragua
engulfed
transfigured
my own children
scattered
the sanba
lost

their tongues
