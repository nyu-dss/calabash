“Which woman?” he asked.

We decide to walk to a restaurant named Cuba-Cuba. They serve the most exquisite oysters with
lemon, empanadas filled with ham, conch balls, white rice, black beans, chicken soup, and the dessert
everyone associate with that region — key lime pie.

“Fly to Havana. $10 only 30 minutes on Q Airlines.” The restaurant served as the local travel
agency to buy plane tickets to Havana. One of the ads decorated a wall of the restaurant. In a photo,
the owner of the “Fly to Havana” enterprise in front of the door to the establishment wore a white
guayabera. His son Bert stood to his right, I smile at my lover pleased with our vacation, then in the
distance I spot her again. It is she, the young woman who was on the beach. Her black hair cut short
shines like lighting bugs in the night. This young woman, the form of her slowly approached. |
thought, why does this woman create so much tension? At the same moment, I said to my lover
“I think it’s time to go to the Institute San Carlos.”

We paid the bill and made our way through a maze of tourists, jugglers, street vendors, magicians,
fire eaters, the ‘believe it or not’ theater, T-shirt stands, and balconies where women were twisting
extensions into the hair of customers.

We entered the Institute. I walked to the end of the hallway while my lover sniffed around the
different galleries. I walked into an auditorium. It was dark. I followed the wall with my fingers until
I found a switch and turned on the light. I walked around, lit a cigarette, and sat in one seat after
another. Occasionally, I went into the hallway to get a drink from the water fountain. I was tense. I
remembered studying nights at the university for a whole semester devoting myself entirely to José
Marti — his essays and a volume of poetry titled Vérsos sencillos. 1 thought of my son listening, over
and over again, to the rap of Guajira Guantanamera by the Fugees. I could almost feel the energy of
Marti and that of the Cuban men and women who had frequented this place.

I told myself “Here I am, close to Marti, yet it cannot be because to be closer to Marti would bring
the sensation of absorbing a buzz from the hot tunnels of these streets, a buzz that would build up
inside of me until I myself would burst with excitement.”

I was sure that I saw her on the stage, or was it a reflection of my imagination or a shadow? A
deep horrific terror invaded me, and I placed my hand over my heart. Naturally it was beating hard,
very very hard. My hands froze, and each second seemed like an hour. Out of instinct I fled the room
before I suffocated. I looked around for my lover. I found him in one of the galleries. To please me,
he caressed my head. He embraced me and said “That’s enough for museums today, but before we
leave I want you to see this last exhibit.” He took my arm and off we went.

“Key West: Images of the Past.” There were photos of a procession. Cubans moving toward a
cemetery celebrating “El Grito de Yara;’ the Cuban Club on Duval Street; two black boys selling
lemons; Hemingway posing with his family in a rare intimate photo; more black kids diving into the
sea with the intention of bringing up the coins tossed to the bottom by the tourists. One photo was
