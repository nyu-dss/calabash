tree fall to the ground. We smell the leaves of the key lime trees, and the azucenas-lilies bordering
the sidewalk. The houses of high ceilings, the mingling of the mango, avocado and rubber trees all
reaching different heights. Looking up, we see electric wires, seagulls and pelicans perched on them
and falcons nesting on the tops of the poles. I pass through quite a number of narrow streets before
I happen upon a cemetery. A stone reads. “I told you I was sick.” Because of the island’s rocky terrain,
practically all the mausoleums are above ground. A door to one is slightly ajar. Its inscription states:
"Here is what remains of Elena Hoyos Mesa, seven years dead and dressed in her wedding dress.”
Finally, I come across a posthumous memorial, a kind of an elegy for the sailors who died in Havana
harbor in 1898.

I decide to go back to the hotel. There are flowers in the bedroom. A divider of big glass blocks
separates the shower from the rest of the bathroom. I notice squares of soap and immaculate white
towels. My lover awaits me taking a nap. After I shower I cuddle up next to his side. He touches my
breasts and begins to kiss me.

He finds my lips

And his start to travel

The encounter more

And more of my body

He kisses my total universe.

Late afternoon, we walk to Sloppy Joes. I want to see the bar where Hemingway got drunk and
shout indignities. In the bar, the walls of natural wood extend to a high ceiling with old fans that
still work. Two walls are covered in black and white photos. Hemingway with Cary Grant in
Havana. Hemingway with Ingrid Bergman. Hemingway with a young Fidel Castro, both showing
off their catch.

We decide to go to the writer’s house, the one built under the supervision of Pauline, one of his
wives. It was the first house with a swimming pool in all of Key West. Then, like now, it was
completely overrun by cats, cats with six toes. This genetic mutation continues to afflict Hemingway's
cats, They urinate in Pauline’s swimming pool, irreverent as ever; they lounge on the couple’s bed,
sleep on the furniture, and in the library on the showcases where the manuscripts of the author are
exhibited.

I went to the public bathroom to splash a little water on myself. I turned on the faucet and tossed
water on my face, neck and arms. As I left the bathroom, there she was. The young woman from the
beach, walking on Hemingway’s patio. It seemed as though she hardly touched the ground, that she
was swaying in the early evening air. She saw me and stopped. Without saying a word, she froze.
Her eyes fixed on me, but they gazed at the horizon within me. I was scared. I took off looking for
my lover, I found him petting one of the cats.

“Did you see that woman?” I asked.
