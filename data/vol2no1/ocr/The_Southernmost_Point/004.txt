of Elena Hoyos Mesa. Her remains had been found in her lover's house seven years after her death,
she'd been buried in her wedding dress.

I was surprised to see a photo of some people in Smokey Joe’s around the 1940’s. There were
drinking double martinis and offering toasts for a Merry Christmas. There were nearly twenty men:
the only woman was chichi Navarro who was dressed in a white see-through tunic very much in the
style of the day. Chichi Navarro, was the woman on the beach.

“Do you know who she is?” I asked my lover.

“No. And you?” he asked.

I said. “Yes.”

That night we made love, not once but several times. I adored the taste of his skin. There isn’t a
man existing on the face of the earth who doesn’t radiate a glow when you suck his skin with the
tongue, lips and whole mouth. He fell asleep, serene and happy. I was exhausted but I still couldn’t
sleep. I turned on the television and watched the weather report. It was announced that rains and

face, neck and arms. When I lifted my head, I felt her presence. She was there. I couldn’t see her, but
I was sure of her presence just as I’m sure of my own existence. I turned around and there she was.

The parrots started screeching loudly.

I went to our table and devoured my food. We drank cranberry juice with rum and lime. We ate
key lime pie with two inches of meringue, and then I asked my lover, “Do you want to go to the
Southernmost Point?”

“Sure,” he said, and off we started.

We walked the length of Duval Street to the end of the sidewalk until we found the black land-
mark. The Southernmost Point.

Out there, tourists for its plazas, fortresses, convents, monasteries, churches and its lack of every-
thing are admiring 90 miles away, faithful Havana. Here we are wishing to be there.

My lover bought an ice cone and began to converse with some tourist. I headed for the beach; I
