The Southernmost Point

T'S THE SOUTHERNMOST POINT. THE PLACE CLOSEST TO HAVANA. A LANDMARK
LE black stone in the shape of a bullet where an inscription reads: 90 miles to Cuba. The closest
point. You can take a boat in the morning knowing full well that by noon you'll disembark in
Havana. From here, Cuba is so close yet so remote.

Tourists snap photos to take home. A Cuban sells ice cones on the corner. Some Haitians hack at
