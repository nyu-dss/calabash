Calabash

Once ashore, they’ve found neither the eternal
fountain of youth, nor riches. Instead,

some landed at chrome with their blistered hopes
locked-up, or are found lifeless on sandy beaches.
Their corpses disturbing fenced-Greenbacks’ eyes.
Others slipped their way

among Florida’s downtrodden

until they were rescued by family members
whose daubed lives Agwe, the spirit of the sea,
spared on the waves of life’s incision

where glutton poverty, like Atlantic sharks,
awaited with rows of festive teeth.
