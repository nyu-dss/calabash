Marooning

They’ve set their dreams sailing
toward the windward passage.
One, two, three hundred
packed on rafters

clinging to their desires

to embrace the Eagle’s

metallic freedom.

They, Toussaint’s descendants,
once proud founders of freedom,
now marooned themselves
with the night sky,

trying to escape hawkish eyes.

They've sailed across the Atlantic,

riding currents.

Feet-damped, skull-baked.

They are once more children of salt.
Avoiding sharks and coast-guard cutters.
They've set their dreams sailing

toward the windward passage,

their dark faces beaten by the sun,

and their blistered hopes marked by scarlet stains,
refusing to be consumed by the whirlwind
of lurking death, they’ve continued

to navigate westward

in search of Juan Ponce de Leon’s legends.
