Senseh

O for a peel-neck hen, one with
ruffled feathers, magic in its feet
to scratch up conjuration. Defeat
the enemy.
One to signal where
the danger lies, so we can root it out
make fresh breeze blow, allow the children to grow.

Ol’people say, every yard must have
a senseh fowl to bring things

into the open, make the wicked pay,
give the people the courage

to try out each new day.

Guinea Hen

In Granny’s eyes, our foremost barnyard warrior is not
after all our fierce Rooster or surly Turkey Gobbler
but mild Guinea Hen, her badge of office her spotted
feathers. She stands on guard at that barrier they call
Reputation. For Granny explicating the difference
between Good Girls and Bad always ends her homily
with warning as fact: Seven year not enough
to wash speckle off Guinea Hen back.

When Granny holds up Guinea Hen as the symbol
of spoilt reputation, we study her pattern and interpret
Granny's warning to mean: Not that you can’t do so.

Just dont let the world know.

Never let the spots show.

Owl
the Owl was a baker's daughter’ —Hamlet IV: 5

Owl isn’t a yard dweller though it lives in close proximity,
overlooking house and land from its niche in the
breadfruit tree.
I hardly ever see it. Its presence I sense when the air
seems churned into motion at dusk; a pricking

of the skin signaling
