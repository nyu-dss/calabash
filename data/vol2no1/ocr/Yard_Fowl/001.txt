Be
Yard Fowl

Rooster

As long as a Rooster somewhere
is angry enough to claw at

the sun blood red rising and
pull it through, day will come:
the world will go on.

Hen

Woman luck lie a dungle heap, fowl
come scratch it up.
— Jamaican saying

Some find you loud mouth and simple,

for every egg laid a big announcement
a cackle, some find you

the broody hen, not knowing all

is meant to throw spies off the scent

of your blood’s secret: you know

the sky isn’t falling, geese don’t lay

golden eggs, superior knowledge

resides in the feet.

You are mistress of maps to the under
layer, to buried treasure. Why else

do you nod your head and give thanks
as you sup? With every scratch,
woman's luck you turn up.
