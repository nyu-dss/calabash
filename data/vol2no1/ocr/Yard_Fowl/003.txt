the ghostly hunter on the wing. The world seems shaken to
feel Owl measure out the air into quadrants for better
stalking; sift the night for prey.

which does not leave me with dread
but a half-life
of something soothing and warm-scented, a present of
morningâ€™s rising crust:
the fecundity of bread.
