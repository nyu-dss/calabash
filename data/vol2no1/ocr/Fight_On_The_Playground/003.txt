found some courage. “Drive up yu bumboclaat car!” someone shouted. I stepped on the gas,
glancing in my mirrors. On the playground, the bully and the grim-faced girl — glaring at each
other — stood still.

I visited my prospects — a hairdresser in glittery bangles and rings; a fat, giggly bank clerk with
a little one on the way; and an attorney with a weakness for garish silk ties. They listened and asked
the usual, but I knew our rates weren’t the best. I knew our company had the least catchy ads, the
least famous CEO, and the least renowned head office. They knew too. But while I spoke and they
listened politely, I wondered if the grim-faced girl had punched down the bully. Or if she had
turned away from him, went over to the short boy, picked him up, dusted him off, then took him
back to his grandmother. (I had a feeling the boy didn’t live with his mother — the bully had been
too fearless. Maybe she lived overseas.) I imagined his grandmother crying at his swollen face and
bloody nose; the girl, grim-faced again, about to stalk back to the playground; the grandmother
holding the girl’s elbow, pleading for the bully’s life.

I raced to the gas place, remembering fights in my school days. Boys — and girls, sometimes —
punching, slapping, scratching each other, dust swirling around their feet, faces contorted in outrage
or rage, with a circle of children noisy around the tussle, some just staring, before an older student
or teacher dragged the opponents apart. I remembered bullies, too. I was fortunate: they only asked
me for lunch money. I'd learned to save money just for their requests. Others were teased or slapped,
or kicked — and for the few who were different, the very gawky, the very stupid, there was the occa-
sional beating.

One I never forgot: a skinny, big-eared boy with effeminate wrists. They shouted names at him
and chased him behind the cafeteria, where he scurried behind rusty garbage pans. They pulled him
out, dragging him through the grass, and began kicking him. He rolled himself into a foetal ball and
screamed obscene things. The ring of us gapers grew —

“No, sar, it too late,” said the girl behind the mesh-grill. Slack-jawed and sleepy-eyed, with stubby
plaits, she glared at me resentfully. I blinked at her affronted tone; my face grew warm. I leaned
against the chipped bagasse counter and moved closer to the grill, but before I could say anything
(‘give me a bligh no, nice girl?”) the girl shook her head.

“Them can't deliver it today again.” Her hand hovered over the cash register’s open drawer,
clenching the money I'd given her. Underneath my palms the counter felt oily, as if with the sweat
of those who begged and failed. Behind me, the people in line shuffled; someone chuupsed.

“Then him never read the sign?” an old woman said.

“You still want the gas?” the girl asked.

I nodded, finally. The girl scowled at the cash register and counted out my change in a blur of
dollar bills.
