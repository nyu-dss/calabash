I made it back to my car. I got in and glanced at the dashboard clock. If I went back to the office,
by the time I got there everyone would have left. Nicole would be home.
I decided to go back to the office.

Homeward traffic had begun, lines of cars and buses fed by lines of cars and buses, and in the
cars and buses or at the bus stops or on the sidewalks filling with people, if people weren’t talking
then their faces looked spent or grave. The long line of cars heading back to the financial district
kept slowing to a stop, making me tired. I was hungry but I didn’t feel like eating. Not without
Nicole. | tried to let the faces distract me. At the bus stop, that man in the hard hat, merino and
scruffy brown jeans: was he worrying about dinner? Standing a little away from him, as if she’d
moved upwind, a woman with natural hair and a plain knee-long dress: was she wondering if
anyone was hiring? In a gleaming Galant gliding by, windows up, a couple chuckling and chatting:
would they still be talking to each other by dinner time?

The car ahead of me moved off and mine crept forward. Suddenly a horn blew — a grey station
wagon zipped in front of me I braked I cussed. A route taxi. I blew my horn. Most of the taxi’s body
stuck out to the oncoming traffic; cars approaching, horns blowing, slowed to go around. At the back
window, an old man in a black tam glanced at me. My car almost touched the door he sat at, but his
wrinkled face showed no expression. His red-eyed gaze seemed lifeless. The taxi driver thrust his
beefy arm out his window and as if flicking flies away waved a filthy chamois at the oncoming cars
and horns. I blew my horn. Why bother? the old man’s eyes seemed to ask. Why them have to behave
like that? | replied with my glare. The old man looked away.

The car before the taxi edged forward and the taxi pulled into the line. The driver perched his
arm at his window, as if showing off his burly triceps. I could believe a machete was underneath his
seat — a greyish blade as long as his arm with sinister stains. The line of cars crawled forward; the
taxi too, as if it had always been in line. I shook my head.

I slowed down to turn into the parking lot. The taxi drove on. I wondered when my wishes for
the driver would be granted.

The office was just a six-storey beige and yellow building with sharp corners, a low-roofed portico
and narrow tinted windows, on a crumbly asphalt lot not much longer or wider than the building
and enclosed by lolling purple bougainvillea and a taut chain-link fence. But the parking lot entrance
so close to the portico, the portico’s roof so near to visitors’ head-tops, and the side walls so close
to the flowers and fence, the building always seemed hemmed in to me, like a tall man forced to
crouch and keep his head bowed and his arms pressed tightly against his ribs. A few cars were in
the parking lot. At the far end, Merriweather’s Pajero glistened as if it'd just been washed and waxed.
He'd bought it three months ago, immediately after making MDRT. Glancing at it, I stepped under
