Nicole's old Corolla was in the garage, and her co-worker Dawn’s station wagon tilted on the
curb. I put my car in neutral and came out and went to the gate. A previous tenant had backed her
car into it accidentally; it bulged out to the street now, as if pregnant, the warped white rails peeling
and rusty, the hinges twisted. I winced at its opening whine. I remembered I'd promised Nicole I'd
call the landlord again and get him to fix and repaint it. The hibiscus hedge, unkempt behind the
dirty concrete fence, rustled in an abrupt breeze. A snatch of voices came from one house; the bassy
thump of dancehall music from another; and television evening news further away. I stood for a
while and looked up the pothole-pocked street: squat flat-roofed houses close together; cars in
narrow driveways shaded by mango or almond trees on tiny front lawns; small grilled verandahs
dimmer than the evening and, from grilled louvre windows, wan light which would be little brighter
when it got darker. In the distance a few street lamps already cast their murky orange light.

Merriweather would never live here, I knew. Neither would Miss Ricketts. Laughter burst from
the house. Nicole and Dawn were still laughing when I opened the door. Dawn was in the sofa,
bending over; her linen skirt hiking up her skinny, stockinged legs; her ostrich-like face laugh-
contorted, seeming even more ostrich-like with her new crew-cut hairstyle. Dawn and her husband
had bought an apartment in the hills, Nicole had told me; a nice place.

Nicole was in the recliner, its foot-rest raised, her plump legs spread like a market woman’s, her
skirt and inner thighs a tunnel which in our earlier days perhaps in a better mood I would have
peeped down like a mischievous school-boy. I'd become accustomed to her scowl — her lips, cheeks
and chin appearing tough and unyielding; her brown eyes flickering between disgusted glares and
angry glances — but her hazel-dyed hair was bundled now on top of her head in a hasty after-work
bun, showing me a face I hadn’t seen in a long time — lips, chin and cheeks looking supple and
relaxed, softened by a broad smile; her eyes amused by some particularly naughty punch-line. She
glanced at me and for a moment the naughtiness slipped. But then it returned; she turned back to
Dawn and waved at my “Good evening” as if her bulky breasts restricted the motion of her arm.
The flesh-folds at her elbow jiggled like they did when I played with them when we used to cuddle
before the television.

Later for me, then. I headed to the bedroom. Her handbag and briefcase stood on her side of the
still made bed — leather territory-markers with brass-tipped edges. Her bedside lamp was on; my
side of the bed and room dim. I changed my clothes, then lay down and closed my eyes. Outside,
they went on talking and laughing.

After a while, Dawn called out goodbye, and Nicole called out to me that Dawn was saying
goodbye. “Goodbye, Dawn,” I said, eyes still closed. Their giggles moved away, then — from outside
— the gate rattling; an engine coughing and sputtering then revving; almost-smooth tyres buffing
asphalt; Nicole’s /ater, a car horn, then silence.

Then, footfalls, heavy on the terrazzo floor. Nicole was in the bedroom. I realized I'd flinched.
