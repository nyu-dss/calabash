But she didn’t even look at me, it seemed. A drawer opened then closed; the closet-hinges squeaked;
a zipper; the rustle of garments; hangers clattering. Footfalls out the bedroom. Pans, plates and
glasses clanging in the kitchen.

I opened my eyes. I remembered restless sleep, opening my eyes not seeing Nicole’s scowling face
closing my eyes guilty relief darkness. Nicole’s lamp was still on. The earlier dimness had deepened
into night. Blue light from the living room TV flickered on the wall, and I could hear the TV’s
muffled laughter. I was hungry. I didn’t hear Nicole. I lifted my head and listened.

Suddenly I wondered —

— but beside me, Nicole’s handbag and briefcase shook when I sat up. The briefcase almost fell.

The kitchen doorway spilled fluorescent light into the blue-dark living room, an oblong shaft
along the floor and up the wall to near where the wall became the popcorn ceiling. On the televi-
sion, a housewife in a sunny kitchen held up a yellow bottle of dishwashing liquid and flashed a
starchy smile. The volume was low. Nicole was sitting in the sofa, her back straight, not slumped as
usual. From behind I couldn’t be sure, but her arms appeared to be crossed. Her shoulders were like
hills rising from the horizon of the sofa’s spine. I didn’t know how to begin.

“What you watching, Nicky?” I said finally.

She turned her head, her face in profile. In the blueness I couldn’t tell if she was scowling. I
remembered nights, so long ago it seemed, before hard times made her so plump and so sullen. Our
sweaty, naked bodies cooling in our embrace, I would play with her breasts (they weren’t so heavy
then) and smile. Nicole would close her eyes and look contented, as if I’d done what I was supposed
to do — took out the garbage, locked up the house, made her feel like a woman.

Nicole turned away from me and back to the television. “Some movie soon start.”

She’d answered. I crossed my arms and leaned back against the wall.

“Nicky, I'm sorry about the gas. I didn’t make it to the place in time...”

“No bother with it.”

“I really tried, Nicky...”

“Me say no bother with it.”

“Nicky, I'm sorry...”

“You no hear me say no bother with it? I went and I paid for the gas. You hear me? I paid for it.”

When I didn’t answer, she turned back to me. “What? You wrong me?”

— go get the gas receipt shove it in her fat face —

“You couldn’t ask for time?”
— shove it in her mouth down her throat —

“T can’t bother. You hear me? I can’t bother.”
