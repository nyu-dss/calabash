would be playing dominoes. A few would sit on the curb or on tall wooden stools before dim bars,
and seem listless or dazed, waiting for day to end.

I glanced at the dashboard clock. I hadn’t gone yet to pay for the cylinder of gas I'd ordered that
morning. If I didn’t want to quarrel with Nicole, I'd have to hurry with my next prospects and race
back to the gas place. Forget lunch. Ahead of my car, horns were blowing. The line was moving too
slowly, and it seemed now that the person at the front, up at the intersection with the main road,
was afraid to push out of the lane. I'd bet it was a woman.

I was about to join in the chorus, but on the playground a tall brawny boy with ashy black
skin, maybe eleven years old, his face in a fierce scowl, stomped over to another boy about the
same age. The second boy was short, with a nearly-bald head and a shiny navel protruding like a
pout. The first boy shoved him — viciously, as if he wanted to crush the short boy’s chest. The
short boy tottered. His flailing hand brushed his attacker’s neck. The tall boy’s scowl turned
murderous. He shoved the short boy again. The short boy fell. His attacker fell on him, fists falling
and rising like hammers.

“Fight!”

The children ran and circled the boys. Shouts rose, but also — from some who watched, mute —
an uneasy silence. The boys were rolling around, tears and mucus streaming down the short boy’s
face. He waved his hands about wildly. I glimpsed blood.

Horns were blowing. I blew mine too. But I realized they were for the driver up at the intersec-
tion, who still hadn’t moved her car out onto the main road. The boy screamed. I looked around and
up and down the street, hoping to see someone, anyone, tell them run into the lot grab the bully
throw him into the fence — but there was nobody, nobody open my door, go out there myself?
Nobody at all

A girl ran onto the playground.

She was about the boys’ age, nearly as tall as the bully, but skinny. Her face was that shade of
black which in all lighting seems to gleam. On either side of her head, a twirled pigtail stuck out
behind her like a goat’s horn. The children hurried out of her way.

She grabbed the bully’s shoulders and hauled him off his victim. His bottom dragged along the
ground, his arms windmilling, his furious face turning to look behind him, then with a scramble of
heels and knees he clambered to his feet and faced her. Her face seemed fixed in a taut grimness.
Her fists were rigid by her side, her legs apart like a gunslinger.

The bully stepped towards her; she towards him. They glared at each other, their faces almost
touching, and he was saying something, and she continued to glare at him, and it seemed at any
second he would shove her, or she slap him — though neither wanted it to happen, but if the other
persisted for just one more second, then God help them, it would.

Horns were blowing. No cars were before me — the woman at the intersection had obviously
