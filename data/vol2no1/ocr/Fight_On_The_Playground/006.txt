as if she'd been laughing.
“Hi, Nicky.” Her interrupted laughter gave me sudden hope: “The gas came?”
Her anger was immediate. “You went and paid for it?”
“They said it was too late, but I was hoping...” My hope died. “You want me bring dinner?”
“I don’t want you do anything.”
“You want chicken?”
“Don’t worry ‘bout me. Me alright.” She hung up.
The cleaning woman, far on the other side of the office pushing her mop, averted her eyes.

The traffic lights changed, but cars which had sneaked past the amber now blocked the four-way
intersection. Their drivers stared straight ahead, as if praying the traffic would creep forward just
enough for them to inch out of the way, out of the reach of accusing glances. Or maybe they stared
ahead, indifferent to those like me waiting for them to move. Horns blew.

I wondered when it had all begun. The quarrel forever awaiting volleys and ammunition, which
when no salvos were fired became a stilted peace. Was it really when our friends started getting
promotions? Or when this or that couple said they could afford to have children now or move to a
better neighbourhood or buy a new house new furniture a new car things I couldn't do anymore
they go out every weekend you going let them fire you again why you not in the mood anymore
you think I too fat you like someone else don’t leave the job you soon find something better why
you don’t want go out anymore is because of me you just want watch TV all the time how you forget
fi pay the bill again don’t let them fire you again my salary can’t keep the two of us again you'd
rather go out with you man friend them ‘stead of me you have woman outside how you forget fi
order the gas I can’t depend on you don’t let them fire you again you know I tired of it —

“Beg yu ten dollars, big man?”

The boy was just tall enough to peer into my car. His dirty striped shirt was torn at the collar, and
mud or grime streaked his hair and face. I felt as tired and hungry as he looked. His outstretched
palm leaned to one side, almost mirroring the angle of his head, which he’d slanted too as if to
intensify his plea. His gaze was aimed at my change tray. But nothing was there. I looked away.

“Please, sar?”

The traffic lights were still red. I kept my gaze forward. Nothing happening again in the economy,
Miss Ricketts. Nobody buying policies again, Miss Ricketts. We need new products, Miss Ricketts.

There was movement at my window. The boy was gone. The evening light slunk back into my
car, tinged reddish-pink by the approaching sunset. The traffic lights changed. The intersection clear,
the traffic lurched forward. I couldn't see the boy in my mirror. Behind me, horns blew.
