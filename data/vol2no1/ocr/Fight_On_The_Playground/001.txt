Fight on the Playground

HILDREN’S LAUGHTER DISTRACTED ME FROM DARK THOUGHTS, I COULDN’T
C quite see them yet — their squeals and shouts were coming from across the street, a few blocks
down the road, from an asphalt lot ringed with droopy chain-link fencing. They seemed oblivious
to the slow line of cars on the narrow lanes outside the lot, the afternoon traffic I was stuck in.
Waiting for the traffic to move, I listened to them, and despite Miss Ricketts’ demand that I sell more
policies or else, I smiled a little.

I wondered why I hadn’t heard them before today, or noticed the lot. Since joining the company,
almost a year now, I drove this shortcut several times a day, almost daily. The route shaved twenty
minutes or so off the journey from the noisy markets and dingy wholesales downtown to the
gleaming towers, chic boutiques, and shopping malls uptown. It passed through the inner city, past
derelict buildings, rusty zinc fences and rickety wooden shacks. I realized that like everyone else, I
was usually speeding through, eager to make it to my next prospect but also to shorten my stay in
this no man’s land, my windows up, my radio tuned to the grumpy talk-show host. I'd never encoun-

I could just glimpse the children now. Their clothes looked like hand-me-downs, mismatched but
not too worn, clean enough to tell me none of these children begged. They were skipping, singing,
running; some throwing around an old tennis ball. I could picture their mothers: neon hairstyles;
faces sullen like Nicole’s; bodies even fatter than hers and bulging out of snug midriffs and tights
without grace or shame. Their laughter would be rare and coarse, their anger swift and brutal. They
always quarrelled with their men too, I'd bet.

No men were about. They usually were this time of day, if I remembered correctly. They'd be
leaning against the street lamp poles or graffitid walls; sitting on grimy concrete fences; or huddled
in the mouths of alleys, murmuring to each other and smoking. Some were wiry and surly, with
boisterous talk or harsh laughter which made drivers speed up and keep their gazes forward. Some
