the portico, and for a moment — maybe because I was hungry — the tall man seemed about to
topple forward head first onto me.

In the lobby, the security guard’s desk was empty. I got into the elevator and pushed the third-
floor button. Outside the elevator the guard suddenly walked by, buckling her belt. For some reason
she wore dark glasses: she forgot them when she came in for her shift, maybe. She looked towards
me and I nodded. She turned away, as if I wasn’t there.

I sat at my desk, phone at my ear, listening to voice-mail. The Accounts Department had left
several messages: some of my clients’ policies had lapsed. Around the office, dour cleaning women
mopped underneath and around unpeopled desks. Every now and then, their mop sticks knocked
against the cabinets and credenzas. Nicole hadn't called.

“I thought you'd gone,” said Merriweather’s belly-deep voice behind me.

I swivelled my chair towards him. Even at this time of the day he was the model salesman — his
fat, smug face like it had never been out in the sun; his silk tie just so down his chest and over his
paunch, like an expensive paisley bib; his shirt and trousers somehow still crisp. Dark, curly hairs
poked out of his cuff like weeds around his gold watch. Up on the wall behind him was his photo-
graph in a shiny frame, the champion agent again last quarter.

“Miss Ricketts want meet with us tomorrow,” he said.

It didn’t help that Miss Ricketts had left a note on my desk saying the same thing or that I heard
Merriweather's effort to keep his voice from sounding an ominous schoolboy tone that someone was
going to get a beating. I kept the phone at my ear and pointed to it. Merriweather nodded, then
waved and walked on. In my first months, we'd had a friendly rivalry, the reigning champion and
the promising newcomer. We no longer played that game. I hung up the phone.

It'd been the same at the other places — Paper Processors; Stationery and Office Supplies; the
Novelties, Oddities and Gimmicks Office; Gimmick Innovations Traders — smirking rivals, bosses
telling me sell more sell more be more persuasive be more aggressive. It’s your merchandise! I’d
wanted to yell at them. I never waited for Personnel to call — once I’d even stayed home a few weeks
until something came along. But those were different days. The economy had been strong, Nicole
had understood then —

“Yu soon finish, sar?”

Eyes down as if she hadn't just spoken, the cleaning woman mopped the aisle, her gnarled arms
not much fatter than her mop stick. She glanced at me askance, almost abashed, as if she’d violated
her profession’s code of ethics.

“Just one more call,” I said, as if I needed her permission. Pushing her mop, she moved away.

I picked up the phone, then dialled our number. On the fifth ring Nicole answered. She sounded
