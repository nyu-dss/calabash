I went

I went into the kitchen. A breeze through the window brushed my warm face and lingered; cool,
almost moist on my cheek. On the stove, congealed tomato-red gravy striped the Dutch pot: bully
beef. Rice poked out from under the dented lid on the little black pot.

I didn’t feel like eating.

Behind me in the living room, music blared and voices argued. Nicole was quiet.

I turned on the burners and took a plate from the dish drainer. A small cockroach scurried under-
neath the rusty skirting of the fridge; another squeezed itself into a crack on the Formica counter. I
washed a glass and poured myself some orange juice. When the bully beef gravy was bubbling and
the rice felt warm to my palm, I spooned some from both into the plate and placed it then the glass
on a tray.

I sat in the sofa, tray in my lap. Nicole looked over at the tray, then back at the television. She
waved the remote before her and the volume rose.

I wasn't really watching. Nicole was quiet. I ate what I could.

[ got up and took my tray back to the kitchen. I scraped what I didn’t eat into the garbage. I
washed the things and put them away, then went back to the living room. I stood beside the sofa,
looking at the television. I wasn’t really watching. The ring of us gapers grew. No one moved to
help. The bullies kicked the effeminate boy. Two girls began crying, one hugging the other, and
teachers came, swinging leather straps. The bullies scattered, but were chased and grabbed and
beaten. The effeminate boy, helped up by a teacher, watched, crying, and yet not watching, as if like
me he wasn’t sure what he was feeling anymore.
