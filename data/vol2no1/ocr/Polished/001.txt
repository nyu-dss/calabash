Louisa Nurse

Be
Polished

Hard, but flawless with character like prisms
Renowned — yet intentionally formed
Deep within the volcanoes of time.
Most wanted.
I see you — mined
I see you through this entrapment
Supposedly chipped and cloudy.
Generations chained to balls of faith
Muted once to the sophism of mouths without hearts
Flogged with the unforgiving rod of injustice.
Multi-faceted scars soared through rivers of blood,
From broken ancestors’ bodies.
Soul determination transparent through light beams of hope
Reflected on the still waters of comfort.
Give credence to my words
Battles fought and won
Crystallised into the psyche of a thousand, thousand
One unified song of freedom
Colourless — to yellow, brown, blue, green, grey
Whatever eye — see the inner man
Cut and polished to increase our brilliancy.

This poem ts one from my anthology Ancestor Passage’. I was reading about the formation of diamonds and I related this
process to “our story” as a proud black people subjected to the forced crossing from Africa to the West Indies and other
influences which fashioned and shape our destiny ultimately leading us to this great legacy left to us by our ancestors.
