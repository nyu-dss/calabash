guy and gal over there, white tourist chick and indigenous ebony black beach god, yep, we do know
the routine. My wife and I, for jaded curiosity’s sake, take up our positions and dance in close prox-
imity, so as to eavesdrop and hear what lines the locals use in this place, to see if they are any
different to those we hear back home. The beach god is dancing with her, teaching her the moves,
guiding her hips and she blushes as she learns. He is apparently a handy teacher, she gets the hang
of it in quick time. My wife and I wait for the kill. Will he lean across with oily eyes and whisper
something salacious in her ear? This particular song is coming to an end, so he'd better make it
quick... but he lets the song end, thanks her for the dance, and with mock formality hands her back
to her boyfriend who was dancing not too far away all the while. Oh dear, Vicki and I think, the
deer got away, better luck next time... hold on, wait a sec, the beach god turns, makes a gesture and
a buxom lass dances up to him and the two of them proceed to show the other couple how two
experts can really put down a good ‘wine’. Vicki looks at me all perplexed and I stroke my chin, not
quite getting it.

Not accepting that all the beach god wanted was to teach a girl how to wuk up properly
Not accepting that ulterior motives seemed to be lacking here

Not accepting that the guy probably wasn’t a beach god at all
Just somebody out with his girl having a good time
And just wanting to spread the good times around

In disbelief, I look around, at other couples, looking to find what I’m accustomed to, familiar with.
I do find at least two beach gods going through their paces, but the overwhelming majority are just
whites, blacks, browns, French, Lucians, humans, all dancing, talking, drinking and generally liming
with little thought to ulterior motives. Friday night seems too short for ulterior motives, the chicken
and lambi sizzling on the grill won’t permit it and the cold beers swimming in the ice buckets need
to be drunk now. And the big truck at the end of the road with those massive belly-rumbling
speakers constantly pummels and yet massages your consciousness until you are... not quite in your
old skin anymore: the bills, bitchy bosses, bad grades, botch-ups, and silly bickering is all blasted out
of you, out into the warm night, a night tight and passionate with wukkin’ up. Anxieties aren't
welcome here. They can wait, ‘til after the music, after tonight. Tell you what, psycho-analyse it later.
Give me a beer and a hot piece of fowl. I'll be what I was when the speakers shut off, some time

away, far from here, far from now, far from Friday night at Gros Islet.

oo
