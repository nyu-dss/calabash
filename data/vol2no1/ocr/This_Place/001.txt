HIS IS GOING TO BE DEJA VU: SEEN IT, DONE THAT, BEEN THERE.

We are here at the reception desk of this posh hotel in the isle of St. Lucia listening to an ever-
smiling smartly attired activities hostess recommending enthusiastically that my wife Vicki and I take
a five-minute drive in the next north-bound route taxi and find ourselves on this Friday night in a
place called Gros Islet.

Looking at her there smiling with all her face, Vicki and I exchange a quick glance that confirms
we agree upon this one: Rio, Baxter’s Road, Maracas Bay, Gros Islet, whatever you say; the names
change but the ingredients vary but slightly. This is Caribbean standard fare: good food, gyrating
music, and a splash of rum, all beneath a balmy tropical sky. Please madam, no need to preach to the
converted. We'll go to this place, just to say we went, to add to our small-talk repertoire in the office-
lunch room while drinking instant coffee and quietly competing with one another to establish who
had the best vacation and did the most exotic thing.

So... get in that north-bound route taxi, take that five-minute ride and get off at this place which,
despite its tempting French name, seems no more exotic to the initiated than any beach party on a
Friday night. Let’s go through our check-list now: at the end of the main village road there’s a
parked truck [Y], equipped with the usual industrial-strength hi-fi system [7] and speakers generating
enough bass to rumble the food in your stomach at a distance of forty yards, and... yes... right in
front the truck are the expected couples wukkin’ up and poochin’ back to the standard Pan-
Caribbean musical diet consisting of a generous helping of calypso, a side-order of reggae, a dash
of French West Indian zouk, all marinated in a sizzling soca sauce. Great stuff for the North
American and European palefaces, but we Trinis, Bajans, Vincies and Guyanese could almost sing the
stuff note for note while asleep. After all, we are the children of El Dorado, the natives of winter-
free paradise, the place those sixteenth century Spaniards were looking for. We know the routine.
Smile at them as they alight from the nearest Jumbo and pass through Customs, take their bags and
escort them up to their freshly laundered air-conditioned hotel suites, indulge them as they make a
few hesitant yet enthusiastic gyrations to our Caribbean groove, encourage them to spend a dollar
or two or more but don’t be too obvious about it. Crass materialism is ok for the first world, but
they don’t want to see the same in us, it sorta tarnishes the island boy image. Hey, just look at the
