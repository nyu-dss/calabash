Calabash

mean mistreater

Maria of the switchblades
black girl of fire and rum
o lady

lady

like you there’s no other
crazy, don’t mean maybe
flower gone astray

so lost so lifeless

faded and withered

by a love

a love unseen

Maria Antonia of the switchblades
black girl of fire and rum
Ay, such a shame!

Ay, such a shamel...

ALL
Ay, such a shame!

(The PEOPLE dance, blocking MARIA ANTONIA 5 way. The guaguanco builds in
a crescendo. The dancers are able to draw MARIA ANTONIA into the dance.
Swaggeringly, she executes “vaccinates” (wines up) for the dancers.

MARIA ANTONIA enters the marketplace. The dancers disperse.)

MARIA ANTONIA
(shouting all around the marketplace) Julian! Julian!

HERBALIST
Wait. Don’t go. I've got something to bind him.

MARIA ANTONIA
Bind? Bind who?

HERBALIST
The wind that swirls around your waist. Come on, don’t give me that. Who

else could it be? That black hick who doesn’t let you live in peace. That man
— and both you and I know who he is — who's taking baths in my herbs so
he won't get arrested or sick. Whoever sees that Negro anymore since he's
gotten so famous? It’s been a while since you've been together. What, did he

leave you?

MARIA ANTONIA
I didn’t spend so much time talking to you. Have you seen him around here?
