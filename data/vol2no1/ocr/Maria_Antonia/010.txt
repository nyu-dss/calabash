MARIA ANTONIA
(pushing one of the carts) Alright, who's gonna keep me from looking for
whoever I please?

CIPRIANO
When will people learn to know you?

MARIA ANTONIA
Cipriano, where’s Julian?
CIPRIANO

How should I know? You think I’m his shadow, or what? Come with me, I’m
off to the gym now to look for him.

MARIA ANTONIA
They saw him in the marketplace and he was saying he was gonna walk his
whole life through, on this last day, to retrace his footsteps. (To a passing
stevedore) Hey, Cheo, where’s Julian?

CHEO
Out of sight and uptight. Since he’s nailing Spider with his right, he’s keeping
cool. This time around I’m betting my pants on Julian.
MARIA ANTONIA

Watch out you don’t lose them.
(A fight ts about to start. To break the tension, CIPRIANO starts singing 4 guaguancé.)

CIPRIANO
Bele Bele bele bele beleba.
ALL
La la Ia...
CIPRIANO
Bele Bele bele bele beleba.
ALL

Plata...
(The PEOPLE begin to clap their hands rhythmically and to play on boxes.)

CIPRIANO

(singing) And now the time has come
to sing to your glory

the undying lesson

of my guaguancé:

so mistreated
