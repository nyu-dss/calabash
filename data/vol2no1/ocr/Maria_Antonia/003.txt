(walking amidst the crowd) Man must be good, a light for this darkness! I don’t

want money, I don’t want money, I don’t want money. (They mistreat him.) Oh,
damn this earth that births vultures at every moment! Bastards! I don’t want
money. Man must be good, a light for this darkness!

A VOICE
Shut that crazy fool up! Shut him up!

(A group of boys hang him by his shoulders from a pole. They poke and prod him.)

FIRST BOY
If you are the son of God, descend!

(They grab LA CUMACHELA.)

CUMACHELA
Turn me loose, what are you gonna do to me? He’s not my husband.

SECOND BOY
(dragging ber over to the MADMAN) Behold your mother!
