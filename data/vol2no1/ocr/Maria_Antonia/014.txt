YUYO
What I promised you cannot happen.

MARIA ANTONIA
Promised me? The promise would be to Godmother or Oshtin, which isn’t the

same thing. And what’s promised to Oshun...

YUYO
But you must understand, things are down to yucca and yams for poor folks.
I can't let you have this food.

MARIA ANTONIA
(throwing the food back on the stall) Don’t go crying poverty to me. What's

YUYO
(throwing the food back in her bag) You know damn well how crazy I am about
you. My brain's turning into water because I can’t think of anything but you.

MARIA ANTONIA
(at a distance, violently) That papaya over there, I like that a lot. (yuyo throws it
into her bag.) And those soursops. (He throws them in.) And that melon. (He throws
it in and gives her the bag.) I'm telling you, in all this earth there’s no one as good

YUYO
But if you take away all the goods, Eleggua won’t be opening any paths for

bag. (She opens the bag and yuyo puts them in.)

YUYO
I don’t know what the hell it is with you, ’cause everything you want,
you get.

MARIA ANTONIA
No, no, don’t think that I get everything, no, no, not everything.

YUYO
All you have to do is move, and the earth kneels before you. What you
