Calabash

(The PEOPLE are enjoying themselves. MARIA ANTONIA grabs a knife from one of
the food stands. In a boastful gesture, the man tries to jump on her. The people try to
restrain him, while she brandishes the knife.)

MARIA ANTONIA

Turn him loose! I'm the one you all are gonna have to deal with, ‘cause I'm
gonna cut his ass.

(The PEOPLE laugh.)

PITICO
Turn me loose, turn me loose!

FIRST HIGGLER
Leave the bitch alone. She doesn’t care if she dies, don’t you see that?

PIELE®
Turn me loose, I’m gonna finish her off once and for all!

(The PEOPLE give in and pIT1CO breaks loose.)

FIRST ONLOOKER
Get him going good, Maria Antonia!

SECOND ONLOOKER

Watch out for that woman, she fights like a man.

(PITICO and MARIA ANTONIA are face to face.
He hesitates when he sees MARIA ANTONIA grasping the knife.)

MARIA ANTONIA
You're pretty dumb if you think you can scare me! Guys like you, I can whip

their ass in crap games!

FIRST ONLOOKER
C’mon, Pitico, show that one what you're made of.

SECOND ONLOOKER
Go ahead, brother, go ahead now.

PITICO
They should have left you in jail until you rot!

(He tries to leave, but a group blocks his way.)

MARIA ANTONIA

(to a food seller) Yuyo, gimme your knife.

YUYO
You're gonna get in trouble, Maria Antonia.
