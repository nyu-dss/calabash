MARIA ANTONIA
Gimme that! (She wrests the knife from him and throws it at p\tT1co 5 feet.) So you

can defend yourself, so you know what I’m after.

C’mon, Pitico, the table’s all set.

Get her, man!

Defend yourself and quit acting the fool.-

FOURTH ONLOOKER
Just go away and leave the bitch alone.

FIFTH ONLOOKER
Stick him, Maria Antonia, stick him.

SIXTH ONLOOKER
I mean, Pitico, a woman!

SEVENTH ONLOOKER
Whistle, Pitico, whistle!

PITICG
(showing off) Look, I’m not gonna get burned over someone like you. You're
living on borrowed time. Sooner or later your hour will come.

(Pitico walks away and a group seizes him.)

SECOND HIGGLER
Maria Antonia! What do we do with him?

MARIA ANTONIA
Why don’t you go look for your mother so she can stick up for you? Or don’t
you have a mother?

FIRST ONLOOKER
She capped you, Pitico.

SECOND ONLOOKER
Cut his ass, Maria Antonia!

THIRD ONLOOKER
After this, brother, you better start wearing a dress!

(A group of boys fondle his buttocks. The PEOPLE approach MARIA ANTONIA.)
