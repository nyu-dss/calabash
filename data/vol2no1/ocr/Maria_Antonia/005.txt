Calabash

(The MAN ignores her. She grabs somebody else walking by and begins to cry.)

MAN
What's up?

CUMACHELA
(tragically) My daughter just died and I got nothing to bury her with.

MAN
So eat her.

CUMACHELA
Your grandmother's who I'm gonna eat, low-life. (To cHopa, who approaches.)
The street’s getting so you can’t even go and die in it.
(CHOPA and CUMACHELA rush over to the garbage and,
panting, rummage through it.)
FIRST HIGGLER
Nine candles for the dead. D’you want candles for the dead? Nine candles!

SECOND HIGGLER
C’mon, this is for the day after tomorrow! Turkey vulture, priest, big dead

man. Buy, m’lady, buy from me. Ten times I’ve won someone the grand prize
and I never told a soul about the names. Buy from me, I’m a poor woman.

FIRST BOY
(holding the other boy's head under his armpit and squeezing until he almost suffocates)

SECOND BOY

FIRST BOY
Who's the man here?

SECOND BOY

Turn me...loose!

FIRST BOY
(squeezing harder) Who's the man here?

SECOND BOY
You.
