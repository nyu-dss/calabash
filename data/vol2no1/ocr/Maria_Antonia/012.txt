HERBALIST
No, but I’m seeing you.

MARIA ANTONIA
Here comes Godmother, old man, don’t tell her where I am.

(She hurriedly hides behind one of the stands in the marketplace.)

HERBALIST
(10 GODMOTHER, who ts approaching) How wonderful it is to see you again!

GODMOTHER
Have you seen Maria Antonia?

HERBALIST
It’s been a while since I’ve heard about her. What’s going on with that black

girl?

GODMOTHER
How should I know? She's not at peace. Since Julian got himself mixed up in
boxing, she cannot find relief. Tomorrow I will dance, sing, and celebrate until
Oshiin comes down and refreshes my child’s eledda. The shells have gotten
all turned around.

HERBALIST
There’s always something good for what’s bad. I’ve got blessed thistle. Orosti
of the earth. Herbs for her spirit. With this, peace will come back to her.

GODMOTHER
(taking the herbs) Don’t forget to come by my house tomorrow. Let me go on
looking for her. They already told me about the fight, they did! The good-for-
nothing! If you see her, remind her to see Yuyo. (She comes forward, calling out.)
Maria Antonia! Maria Antonia! (Exits.)

HERBALIST

(To MARIA ANTONIA, who leaves her hiding place,
while showing her a bottle of honey)

With this Oshun got Oggin out of the forest. Look, ofii, offi, to sweeten your
voice, your body, to sweeten your life, m’lady.

MARIA ANTONIA
Listen, I know how to take care of those myself. And up until now, that Negro
hasn’t stopped eating out of my hand whenever I wanted him to. (Leaving the
HERBALIST 5 stall) Now then, let me bless you with epazote, since I believe
you're the one that needs protection.
