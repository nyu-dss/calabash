Calabash

(She cleanses him mockingly. MARIA ANTONIA vanishes among the market stalls.)

HERBALIST
One day the world will fall apart, and that laugh of yours — please God it

changes into knives! (Exits.)

MARIA ANTONIA
(calling out) Julian! Julian! (To apUSHCART VENDOR) Hey you, where's Julian?

PUSHCART VENDOR
I don’t know.

MARIA ANTONIA
(walking towards YuYO stall) Hey, white boy! Now I’m gonna spend a little
time with you.

YULO

You're a sight for sore eyes. It’s been a while since we've seen each other.

MARIA ANTONIA

Every now and then it’s good to get lost and breathe some other kind of air.

YUYO
As long as it’s for one’s own good. (To MARIA ANTONIA, who is throwing
produce into her bag) Hey, hey, hold on a minute, okay? You're taking all the best

ones.

MARIA ANTONIA
(sensuously) Are you going to deny me, your own family, two or three yams?
Madrina wants to make fritters.

YUYO
You know how things are, really bad. People don’t have bread, and when

there’s no bread they get all bent out of shape and don’t pay. Business is going
from bad to worse every day. Yesterday I didn’t even make enough money for
the trip.

MARIA ANTONIA
And this plantain here? How’s that bunch over there?

YUYO
You know I've never denied you anything, but...

MARIA ANTONIA
Oh! Scratch me here...on my back. Scratch me! What were you saying?
