Calabash

HERBALIST
Elm, slippery elm! Ofa. Abaile. Iggolé. Iki yenyé. Ewo ola.

MARIA ANTONIA
What kind of abracadabra are you talking?

HERBALIST
Light and life for your spirit and ashé for your body: Christmas bush!

MARIA ANTONIA
Bah! Quit showing off, your fifteen minutes are up.

CIPRIANO
Hey, black girl, what’s happening?

MARIA ANTONIA
Just passing for white until they find out.

CIPRIANO
You don’t have to be white to be worth something.

MARIA ANTONIA
In this country, being white’s a full-time job.

THIRD HIGGLER
You really lost it, you know? We all thought you'd had it.

MARIA ANTONIA
That’s what a lot of people want, to see me behind bars or in my grave, but
I'm not gonna give them that pleasure. Maria Antonia’s gonna be around for
a good long time. From now on, as long as there’s breath in my body, jail and

me are strangers.

FOURTH HIGGLER
There’s no man alive who can get in your way. What happened with that guy?

MARIA ANTONIA
Poor guy, he thought he was going to shut me up.

FIRST HIGGLER
Women like you, daughters of the flame, deserve a toast. Here, my queen, have
some rum from my special supply.

(MARIA ANTONIA drains the glass.)

PEOPLE
Long live the boldest black woman to walk this earth! Hurray for Maria
Antonia! Viva!
