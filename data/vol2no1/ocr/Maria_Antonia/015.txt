need is love and affection, Now everything tastes like glory to you, but
when the years begin to fall... You have to start thinking about the future
and about me.

MARIA ANTONIA
(sarcastically) Little pickaninnies to watch over me in my old age!

BUY O:
(imploringly) Why don’t we see each other tonight?

MARIA ANTONIA
(mockingly) | got a date with the devil.

YUYO
A man like me’s what you need.

MARIA ANTONIA
No, no. I don’t want you to ruin yourself for me. I don’t want to corrupt you.

You're a good man. You like me without any self-interest.

YUYO
Everything in life is about self-interest. You come to me because you know

that sooner or later, you get away with what you want...

MARIA ANTONIA
Don't get all evil-minded.

YUYO
...and I give it to you, because I’m hoping that one day you'll invite me to

your room. (tries to embrace her violently)

MARIA ANTONIA
(out of his reach) Nobody, nobody gives anything for the good of it, that’s the
truth. So don’t be such a jerk and learn to have fun in life, like me, and I’m
one helluva woman. (She withdraws, calling out.) Julian! Julian!

YUYO
I'm not letting this go. Tomorrow you and I'll see each other at the drumming,

MARIA ANTONIA
(calling out) Julian! Julian!
