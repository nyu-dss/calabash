More recently, Jeff Konigsberg, Michael’s studio mate at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s
World Trade Center Studio Program, explained that Michael’s two newest works, which were also
lost in the World Trace Center tragedy, depicted the autobiographical figure being pierced by
airplanes accompanied by meteors and flames. This was not new for Michael, simply the trajectory
of a flight he had been working on consistently for many years right up until his untimely death in
his studio.

One cannot help but notice the eerie connection between the imagery in Richards’ work and his
tragic death. Though ever forward in his conceptual practice, Michael found sustenance in the
subjects of the past, most specifically the triumph and tragedy of the famed Tuskegee Airmen. A
team of World War II Air Force pilots, as famous for their flying skills as they were infamous for
their alma mater, where black men were subjected to being live experiments on syphilis, the airmen
represented a crucial space for dialogue and thought that Michael continuously mined. He worked
with the inexhaustible history of the Tuskegee Airmen for almost the last ten years, including his
most recent works.

After receiving his BA from Queens College in 1985 and his MA from New York University in
1991, Michael completed the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program in 1993 and went on
to the Artists-in-the-Marketplace Program at the Bronx Museum in the Arts the following year. He
was an Artist-in-Residence at The Studio Museum in Harlem in 1995-96 and at the Socrates
Sculpture Park in 1997.

Considered one of the most prolific artists to come through The Studio Museum A-I-R Program,
he was included in the prestigious Passages: Contemporary Art in Transition curated by Deidre Scott.
That exhibition presented Tar Baby vs. St Sebastian, (1999), a seminal work in his series about the
Tuskegee Airmen, where the artist’s cast body in the uniform of the airmen is pierced with model
airplanes. St. Sebastian, the patron saint of soldiers and athletes because of his physical endurance,
was martyred for protecting the captured Christians he was supposed to imprison.

While Michael's untimely death is a grave tragedy to us all, his life and work will be preserved by
museums and galleries, and treasured by friends and new viewers, and recorded in the history of

American art for generations to come.
