ICHAEL RICHARDS’ ART WORKS TOOK ON SENSITIVE THEMES WITH FORMAL
M vec: to create images whose resonance and vitality will continue to amuse, provoke, and
communicate. As a Jamaican-American raised in Kingston, Michael found sustenance in the poetic
ambiguity of all human experience. Jorge Daniel Veneciano, one of the many curators who was
affected by Michael’s work, once framed a discussion about Michael’s work around Ralph Ellison,
one of Michael’s heroes whose reference will live long in his art. Born in New York in 1963,
Michael’s work is a synthesis of the 1970's Black Arts Movement in which he grew up and the
multiculturalism prevalent in his formative years as a student and artist.

While Michael's work employed culturally-loaded symbols such as hair, tar, feathers, rubber and
mirrors, his primary medium was bronze. Often employing molds of his own body, the sculptures
provoke questions regarding the ways n which subtle signifiers affect our place within society. “The
mirrors are a metaphorical device — a reflection of society and how we perceive ourselves through
the eyes of others, the ways in which self-perception is molded through myths, stereotypes and
subliminal messages,” he told Marysol Nieves of the Bronx Museum of the Arts.

Michael's life-size figurative sculptures set ready-mades of ancient and modern mythologies
within a contemporary landscape. A ladder made of feathers, a chariot with a broken wheel, and a
punctured forearm represent some of the icons in Michael's lexicon of imagery. In his sculptures as
well as his drawings, the figure was positioned in a narrative that lent itself to layered readings.
Venecianc, curator of Richards’ 1995-1996 Artist-in-Residence exhibition at The Studio Museum

in Harlem, wrote in the exhibition catalogue:

His form of appropriation is more on the level of the conceptual, intersecting
the visual; it is essentially symbolic. This is apparent in works such as Escape
Plan 76 (Brer Plane in the Brier Patch) and The Great Black Airmen, where cultural
constructs from folklore to African-American history function as topical and
categorical ready-mades from which the artist culls his subjects and juxtaposes

them to elicit their hidden contradictions as well as their poignancy.
