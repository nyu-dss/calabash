A view

in this outlandish room
where my new life hums
i separate white from dark
optional from inevitable
need from want

and i wonder

how did my mother separate

woman from mother

wife from shadow

who taught her all pains were bearable

my own childrenâ€™s room

stands indifferent now

the silent hallway populated by shadows
as i listen for that delicate wisp of breath
to signal life

and behind some silent door
in some windowless room
with a heart beaten-down shut
someone is throwing in

the white with the dark
