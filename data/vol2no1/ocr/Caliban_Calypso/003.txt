66 / Pamela Mordecai

Calabash

The sound prickle him body,

it make him head start rise;

him bruck a stick and clean it off
and start lick galvanize.

CHORUS

VI
So man when the music reach you
and the rhythm start take hold
and you feel the need to bring
the little chap in from the cold,

consider meditation

and the fruits that it can bring;
remember breed and grind

is two very different someting.

CHORUS

Vil
And too we come from island
So we know you Prospero
Fancy yourself as high priest
Sporting cape and wand and so

Serve up you owna pikni

As a hapless sacrifice

Is want you want you kingdom back
No matter what the price

So poor Miranda never understand...

But you better know say that we understand
That the island man-of-words is Caliban â€”
So we jumping when we hear him playing pan
For we love that man-of-words, that Caliban.
