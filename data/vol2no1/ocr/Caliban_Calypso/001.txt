De
Caliban Calypso

OR ORIGINAL PAN MAN

CHORUS

And, too, we come from island
So we know you Prospero
Fancy yourself as high priest
Sporting cape and wand and so

Serve up you own-a pikni

As a sacrifice

Is want you want you kingdom back
No mind the price

You never give the girl a chance

To organize she own romance

You fraid Miranda get to understand

That the island man-of-words ts Caliban.
You fraid Miranda get to understand
That the shaman man-of-words ts Caliban.

I
On high hillsides or as he floats
over the blue in small bright boats
see homo Caribbeanis grin
at how he’s fecund, revelling in
how the ting-ting can spring
the fire in him wire still crackling.

“So, how much pikni you make, man?”
Him can’t answer you back

but him quick to tell you

woman is a leggo-beast — “so slack!”
