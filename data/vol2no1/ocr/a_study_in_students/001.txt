a study in students

international students have return tickets and I-20s
use boarding passes as bookmarks

convert US prices to home currencies

can’t envision being surprised by residency

they remember the names of things and roads

have more than a trace of an accent

don’t have originally tacked on when folks ask them where they’re from
protest against winter and other encumbrances

they are not complacent about airports and goodbyes
don’t have a credit history or a basic handle on Halloween
haven't had memory perjure itself in nostalgia

still speak in absolutes — God, colors, home.
