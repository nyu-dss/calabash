94 / Janet Arelis Quezada

Calabash

a self-proclaimed bad girl

the weighted chemistry unglued her wigs

she threw them at the cameras with her shoes
explosive dribble off her lips

tengo una pena en el alma

producers called it salsa

careful cover over campo grass,

blood-stained sugarcane and slavery in the islands
the liner notes don’t list the band

we cannot trace the history of the trombones
the hands that made the long yells

that we heard when tias put their hands on hips
and demanded “y donde estabas tt?”

oye papi, y como te llamas tu en el tumbao

we string together names of the dead

and pass our tongues over

hector, la lupe

one name for those dead in vietnam

on the streets, in apartments with no heat

from unknowns like winter,

or the hard cages where they put colorful creatures

porque yo tengo una pena en el alma
