 

Janet Arelis Quezada
Te

tengo una pena en el alma

each word bitten down

until the sweet tastes like fibrous grit
and chokes on the way down

but maybe you'll forget

each scream between sex and death
between joy and a growl

maybe you'll forget the sound
baptized herself with names

la yiyiyi

you'll forget the sound of her voice

ay mi yi yis

motown funk and august in harlem, detroit, philly
the steps and porches sag under feet, pat, pat

oye mami, I can’t understand what you're sayin’
but I sure do like the beat

boogaloo

doo-wop molasses over goat-skin taut with moans
molondrones called okra

grits called maicena

the peanut vendor empieza su pregon y ya se va

cuando mas pude quererte sin deternete te dijé adios

she was an addict to the music and the drugs
mascara round her eyes like freshly laid tar
voice went down our throats like miel de abeja
with a sting
