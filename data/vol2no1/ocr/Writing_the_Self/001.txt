Writing the Self, the Self that Writes

HAVE NEVER DESIRED NOR SOUGHT TRAGEDY. I HAVE NEVER WANTED THE
I ending to my story, my life, to be one in which I was consumed by all that I had left unsaid.
While I had been writing all of my life, 1 began to write poetry seriously in my early twenties,
impelled initially by the need to change or at least to cohere the story of the life I had been given,
ostensibly by my parents.

In 1972, I was born in Jamaica to a Venezuelan mother who had immigrated with her family to
the island when she was eight years old. Her mother was a British-Trinidadian woman who divorced
my mother’s father, a Venezuelan man, shortly after the family moved to Jamaica. Staying in Jamaica
to raise my mother and aunt without their father, my grandmother stopped speaking to them in
Spanish. As a result, through the absence of language and cultural connection, my mother largely
lost access to the Venezuelan side of her heritage.

My father’s story was different from but in some ways parallel to my mother's. He was the son of
a British mother and Jamaican father of African and Indian descent, both of whom met by
corresponding as pen-pals before my father’s mother moved to Jamaica. The product of their union,
my father, was what was known in that time as “coloured” and, by birth, was a member of the
middle-class minority on the island. As a young adult and up to his death, my father suffered from
schizophrenia, which I think more than any other factor accounted for his feelings of isolation and
alienation from others, feelings that the disease continued to exacerbate and/or that exacerbated the
disease. With schizophrenia, as with much mental illness, it is difficult to separate cause from effect.

Having been born and raised in Jamaica as a child and in a different time period than my parents,
it is impossible for me to know how they felt about themselves or about their relationship to
Jamaican society. The fact that they both became Rastafarians raises even more interesting questions.
Here were two individuals, light-skinned or “white” in the case of my mother, both ftom middle-
class Jamaican homes, who joined a religion which also served as a black empowerment movement
and which was led primarily by members of the darker-skinned, economically disenfranchised
majority in Jamaica. What was their motivation?

Depending on whose version of the story I’ve heard, I come away with answers at odds with each
other. My grandparents contend that my mother, in particular, was mistaken and even foolish to
