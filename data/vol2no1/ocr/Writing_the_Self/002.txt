think she could go against the colour of her skin and be accepted as a Rasta. My mother, when she
speaks of that time in her life at all, describes it as having given her a sense of fortitude and purpose.
To this day, she practices as a Rastafarian despite living in the United States away from that
community.

At the time, my parents’ religious beliefs were at the height of controversy within my family, I
was too young to understand the full nature of what was happening. While I remember being called
a dutty Rasta often on the streets of Kingston, my memories of my early life in Jamaica are
fragmented. It is difficult for me to try to reconstruct this period with absolute veracity now, from
the perspective of an adult. My father died when I was nine, shortly after my sisters, mother, and I
moved with our grandparents to the States. So it is impossible to ask him, either, any of the questions
that for me still need answering.

Many of my attempts to come to terms with identity are fed by my desire to understand precisely
what I cannot ever truly know: who my parents and grandparents were, and in turn who I am as an
extension of them. Often, the writing of poems that begin in an autobiographical space is for me
an act of not only, or even truly, recreating the past but of rewriting it.

Countless writers have spoken of revision as the basis of all writing. For me, the moment I became
a writer is the moment I realised the power of poetry to lie. I understood then that I needed to
separate the “truth” I was searching for, the facts and details of something that had happened or that
I had witnessed, with the emotional “truth” of the experience. And I began to make it up.

In making a poem art and going beyond its cathartic function, the interests of my own self are
frequently submerged. If I need to change details of the story upon which a poem is based in order
to have the poem succeed in its own right, I do it. My allegiance, from the moment I became a writer,
shifted to the poem, which is artifice but is also greater than the life or the individual.

Yet, the individual — what we call “voice” perhaps — is clearly still present in the poem. The
negotiation of the self with aesthetic concerns, in fact, has always struck me as responsible for the
tension that makes poetry such a compelling and visceral experience. As a Jamaican-American, I am
aware of my desire at times to label myself solely a Jamaican writer, due to my attachment to Jamaica
as “home” and my conflicted feelings regarding being an American. But this would be partly false
given the totality of my life and experiences. In a related vein, I see no discrepancy, as do some
others, with saying that I am black “politically” and mixed “genealogically.”

Poetry has allowed me to live these and other hybridised spaces, these identities in conflict, and
to move away from the sentimental “tragedy of the mulatta” or of any figure of “exile.” Poetry has
taught me how to write myself into being and counter fragmentation through the lie of wholeness
a poem constructs.

Am I then alive only within the poem? Yes and no. The poem is pretense, and the flesh and blood

person I am cannot ever be identical to the poem and is not even, as Borges said, sometimes the same
