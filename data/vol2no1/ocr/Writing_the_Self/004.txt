presupposes that the self is known. The converse of this is also true and is a main impetus for me
in writing. That is to say that I write what I don’t already know but what I hope to learn. If I have
the answer, there is no discovery, no sense of wonder, for me in the poem. And I can barely ask that
response of a reader if the same is not true first and foremost for myself as the writer.

Some years ago I came across a poem I wrote in one of the various scrapbooks of my sisters and
my childhood artistic endeavours my mother has compiled and saved. I would have been about six
at the time it was written and the poem’s structure and content reveal the workings of most children’s
minds. Nevertheless it reminds me of the reason, now twenty-odd years later, that I continue to write.
Searching through speaking, the process of understanding the self and world through writing, is
what I find most vital and sustaining. And in the end, the answers, if they come, are nice, but an

unexpected bonus:

I wonder how high heaven is.

I try to fly up to the sky
but down I fall again,

Plop. Plop.
