person who writes. But we are all constructs, beings in the end, like poems, of our own making, And
I know that as much as I am the writer, in the act of composition I also become that self I bring
into existence on the page. I am the line break of desire. I am the rhythm and cadence of my speech.

Questions of ontology, of being, have been the basis of poetry and philosophy since the first
humans walked out onto the Savannah of Africa and looked up at the sky in wonder. Whether
definitions of my life are grounded in my experience making mud pies in the yard with my sisters
or yours are c.titred on eating a knish for the first time at a deli in New York, we are asking the same
questions. Why am I here and why am I, I? Why am I me and not you? Where do we meet and
merge identities and where do we separate and become ourselves, individuals?

Lately I have begun to ask these questions not only in relation to events that have happened to
me or to my family members but also in relation to those issues and occurrences I witness in the
larger world. Many of the poems I now write move more consciously between the persona of an
‘T’ as individual and the reality of he/she/we/them, which is our inheritance as members of a
broader community.

Even so, I am aware that the individual communities from which we come shape the ways in
which we each view and interpret the world. I am not from a line of writers or literate people in an
academic sense. In my family, I was the first person to graduate from college and the first to take up
the pen as a profession. Yet, I am from a line of individuals who taught me from a young age how
to create life through the imagination.

My grandfather told me Anancy stories and jokes and riddles as a child, instructing me in the
darkness of star-filled nights on a verandah in Kingston in how to see and name the constellations,
how to use the stars to find your way home. My father would take me with him down to the gully
in his mother’s backyard to listen as he played his guitar and sang the trees and light of dawn
washing over the sea into existence.

As much as she complained about the flowers that filled her home in Jamaica, causing it to look
like a_ funeral parlour as she was prone to say, my grandmother's gardening was how she found order.
It was her way of asking the world to reveal to her something of beauty and structure, something
she has sought in her own life to replicate. My mother is also an artist, perhaps more than any other
manner in that she believed her life was truly hers for the making. She encouraged the same in her
children, prodding us, my sisters and I, to sing, dance, write poems, make up stories, act out plays,
create collages and drawings, in short to experience the world through art and the process of
creation.

To these four people, I owe the story of my life thus far and the poems of my past and present.
Through their rootedness in and shifting identification with the Caribbean, Latin American, Europe,
Africa, and Asia, my own work has come into being and simultaneously my own self.

In any writing class, one of the first “rules” you learn is to “write what you know,” which often
