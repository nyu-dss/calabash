Calabash

VIII
We were taken back to the district,
her hair was cut.
Still she hungered
for nakedness, roots, herbs, locked hair
and the first chance she got
made her way back to the river.

As for me

I do not walk by bushes

without hearing a womanâ€™s voice singing,
pass a body of water and not see

an old shape

small and dark

calling me back home.
