Calabash

Vv
When I went over

she took me by the hand,

we watched our shadowed selves
on the water’s surface,

then I heard it:

voice like a woman sighing,

or singing.

We looked into the water,

Then jumped in.

VI
I was afraid,
the dark and the deep
— a frightening feel
of falling —
she held me close,
my head against her bosom,
until we got to the bottom
where she fed me roots and herbs
that made me sleep.

VII
The men from my district came

with trucks, vans, chain-saws,

cut through the forest,

uprooted trees,

tried to fill the river with stones

to make sure another girl-child

would not be lost to them

— every year the forest claimed a woman.

Vill
They found us
entwined, covered in green leaves
at the bottom of the river
and they pulled us apart.
I held onto a memory:
circle of women,
fire, black cat with green eyes,
a silver moon,
voices raised in singing.
