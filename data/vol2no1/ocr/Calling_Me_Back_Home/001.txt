Me
Calling Me Back Home

— for the muse

When she thought no one was looking
she removed the dress they had given her,
crawled naked into the river.
Men later insisted
they saw something silver in the sunlight

— looked like fish scales —
one even said it had grown a tail.

My Great Grandmother had warned me
not to walk alone in the bushes,
not to talk to strangers
— especially not women in the bushes —
and never to look into water.

She stepped from behind
a tree,
small, dark, woman,
chain of teeth around her neck,
locked hair, webbed hands and feet.
She called me to the river's edge,
“Come dance with your water self” she said,
standing in white mist near blue falls.

It was said I was lost for two weeks in the forest.
