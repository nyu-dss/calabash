of blood no one mentioned but I saw on the towel
Manolo placed, warm and damp, against my skin.
“Esta ya,” he’d say, “Todo bien.” And I'd look

at the mirror, at the absence of my hair, my scalp
so baby-powder-clean, smooth, white. Always a new

on the barbershop floor next to the clumps of hair,
mine, other children, men whose lives, like mine,
shone like a new haircut in this land of cracked mirrors.
