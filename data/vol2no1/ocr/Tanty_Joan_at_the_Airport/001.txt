[A.T.A FLIGHT NO. AA 088]

DECEMBER 19 2000

Fed up ah cold New York an’ workin’ so hard everyday

So ah decided to book ah flight to Trinidad on A.T.A.

To spend de Christmas, relax, an’ enjoy some sea breeze
Drink some babash, some rum punch set meh mind at ease

Ah ent cook, ah ent eat, ah so busy, ah can’t be late
Dey say get dere early, an’ absolutely no overweight
An’ girl, dey ent give ah seat when ah book meh flight
Ah feel dey overbook, but de eh go add to meh plight

De flight leave at seven, but ah reach dere since three
A.T.A. section close, ah cold, an’ ah have ah hot pee
Ah can’t find ah bathroom, ah trembling, is ten degrees
Wish ah could do it dere, but ah ’fraid meh butt freeze

When de door open, ah bolt in, an’ ah was third on de line
Inside warm, dis is heaven, yuh girl feelin’ super fine

Ah waitin’, yes ah watchin’ as de line gettin’ really long

De flight manager come to de desk an’ start singin’ ah song

Sorry for the inconvenience, please can you bear with us
Bear wit’ us my ass, yuh know, all dem Trini start to cuss
As I was saying, excuse us, we are very sorry for de delay
De counter we are using for dis mornin’ is nine doors away

Ah been waitin’ here for hours was third on line now ah las,

All dem A.T.A. people could line up an’ kiss meh black ass

We reach de check in counter me, Noreen, Kiesha, Auntie Joan
She thirty pounds overweight, Joan shoulda leave dem ting home
