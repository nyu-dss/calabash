Calabash

Ah get in she suitcase trowing ting left, trowing ting right

Ah don’t care what get leave back ah ent missin’ dis flight

Ah throw way all de clothes she was carryin’ for she friends
An’ ah twenty pound ham, Lord, it look like we nightmare end.

We get check in, oh boy de departure gate half ah mile away
When we reach dere we tired, we ent bitchin’, no, not today

Ah sit down dere blowin’ short, ah tryin’ to ketch meh breat’
Ah fat woman comin’, she crawlin’ an’ she covered wit’ sweat

She say can yuh move ‘round lemme sit down, recover, get at ease

No overweight dem people throwin’ way all dem good clothes please
She say ah work so damn hard in dis bitter cold to spend meh money
Ah have on every piece ah extra clothes, dey going home wit' meh

After ten minutes de woman stand up, start to take off clothes
She peel of five pants, two belt, an’ eight pair ah panty hose
She take off seven shirts an’ ah tell yuh four extra brassiere
Before she get down to de original outfit she was goin’ to wear

De flight was off de ground, finally, more than three hours late
Ah ent care ah goin’ home for Christmas yuh better get dat straight

Once again when we reach Trinidad for Auntie Joan ham ah apologize
She say ah went for it after check in, it in meh bag check de size

oo
