“Well you can try me out, sir. Let me sing a little bit for you. See what you think.”

“Do you accompany yourself or do you need a band?”

“I used to play the quartro. But I had to sell it when I move to here.”

“Where did you play in Trinidad? Would I have heard of any of the places?”

“I don’t think so, sir. They was mostly rumships, nightclubs, and beach outings. But I was in
Calypso Tents once. And I come out fourth.”

“Have you cut any records?”

“No sir. I couldn’t find a producer.”

“But you were doing okay in Trinidad.”

“I was making a living.”

“So why did you come here?”

“Because Trinidad is full of Calypso singers. They got more Calypso singers than they got dog
on that island. Only a few can get big. Not everybody. Only a few. So I come here because I might
stand a better chance.”

“How old are you?”

“Twenty eight.”

“Archie, I don’t know if you're lying to me or not, but I’m going to give you a chance. Friday
night we're having a little party, just for my friends. It’s sort of a pre-opening party. There’s going
to be a band here. Harry Bang and His Rhythm Boys. You heard of them?”

“YES SIE”

“The party starts at eight. They’re going to be here around five to set up and rehearse. Come by
then and work with them. And when the party is in session I want you to sing two sets. That'll be
your audition. After I hear you, then I'll decide if I can use you or not.”

“Right.”

“Friday afternoon.”

And that’s how it start. I hitch back up the country and walk on the beach all night practicing
every Calypso song I know. All them songs we used to sing when we was in school. I know if I had
to I could accompany myself on the quartro. My Uncle Charles show me how to play it. I can’t play
it good but I could play a little bit. I know how to strum chords and for me, that’s enough.

Anyway I went back that Friday afternoon and practice with the band. Harry Bang the leader
told me up front that he didn’t like Trinidadians and I told him up front that he could kiss my battie.
After that we get along real good. Of course the joke in all of this is that I ain't even ftom Trinidad.
But I had to say that because everybody know that’s where all the Calyspo singers come from.

I sing in the mike and the band had trouble staying up with me. Harry told me to slow down. So
that’s what I do... This was the first time in my life I ever sing with a band. Now you and I know
that. But they didn’t. And every time they would stop and say, “You singing off key,” or “singing too
