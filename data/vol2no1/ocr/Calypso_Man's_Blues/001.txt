Calypso Man’s Blues

A NOVEL (EXCERPT)

All of this happened a long time ago during the dark ages when Rock n’ Roll was just being born. When Pan
American Airways ruled the world of travel. When the beach scene in From Here to Eternity set a new standard
Sor sex on the screen and a honey colored singer with a sugar-cured voice exploded on the scene with a best selling
album called Calypso.

This was the 1950s, a long time gone by.

Dear Scobbo,

I know you must be thinking bad bout me because I say I would write but then I don’t write.
The thing is I been busy. Busy like a dog. This St. Ursula place everybody so excited about ain’t
easy you know. No man, it ain’t easy at all. See, it easy for the people who born here. They ain’t
got no worry. They born under the American flag. And when you born that way you ain’t got no
worry. You can just sit on your ass all day and Uncle Sam will pay your bills. But is people like me
who got to work. Got to bust ass to make two ends meet. We is the aliens. We is the outsiders. We
is the fucking foreigners. And these people don’t like us. They think just because they is Americans
their shit don’t stink. So they call us all kinds of names like “Garrots” and “shit mullets” and things
like that. And they even write Calypso songs about us that say things like: “Poor islanders go back
where you come from.”

You see, they think God smile on them because America take over this island years ago and put
the Navy base here. Now the Navy base gone but America still holding on to the place and giving
them Government money. So these people think ain’t nobody can touch them, talk to them, or fuck
with them at all.

Now I don’t say nothing, but I know for a fact that these people black like me, ugly like me and
their asshole is as stink and dirty as mine. And if I know anything, I know that Americans don’t like
