fast,” I would say, “I never had no trouble with Cyril Diaz in Trinidad or the Calypso Rhythmmakers
from Jamaica. I sing with them and they never complain. What’s wrong with you boys?” So we work
and work and had three songs I could sing with them smooth. By the time the party was on, I was
putting movement and style in the way I was singing them songs.

Oh, you shoulda seen this place. White men and white women laughing up and talking, and
drinking and slapping one another on they back. I sing my three numbers, but I don’t think anybody
was paying much attention. Harry Bang play and people dance. I sit up on the stage just smiling and
clapping my hands. There was a lot of pretty women in the place. Women that make you want to
jump off the stage and put you hands all over them. But I didn’t do nothing like that. I just sit there
smiling and clapping my hands with the music.

At the next set, I sing again. This time Bob Blick and some friends sit at the table right in front
of the bandstand. After Harry finish playing his saxophone, I went to the mike and did my three
numbers. Then Mr. Blick wave to me to come down and join them. So that’s what I do.

“Archie here was auditioning tonight,” he say to his friends. “What do you think? Should I hire
him or not?”

“Oh yes. Definitely,” this white woman with a big mouth and a lot of white hair said. “He’s
wonderful. Wonderful. Best Calypso singer I’ve heard.” You could see she was drunk. Real drunk.
So nobody was paying too much mind to her. But the others said “Yes” too. Then Bob look at me
and said, “Well, there you have it. The vote is in. I guess you're hired. Come by Monday at ten, we'll
talk about salary and contracts.”

“Yes sit.”

“And Archie, one more thing.”

“Sir?”

“Are you legal or illegal?”

“Illegal, sir.”

“Okay, okay. Talk to me Monday.”

See, I figure I better tell the truth about that. Because somehow or other he will probably find out
later on and then I'll be in more trouble.

When I went home I wonder to myself, “Why did I tell the man I was a Calypso singer?” I guess
it was because I had heard him on the phone saying that he was looking for one. And I figure to
myself, How hard can it be, singing Calypso? Every low dog gutter rat from the island I know
singing Calypso, so why not me?

That Monday I went by and we sign a contract. One hundred dollars a week, plus dinner and
three drinks from the bar. The contract is for six months unless he decide to fire me sooner.

“We have to do something about your immigration status,” he say to me.
