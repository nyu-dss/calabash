black people. No sir, they don’t like them at all. Sometimes they pretend to like us if they want to
get something from us, or if they want us to do work for them. But other than that, them people
would rather kick us in our ass than say “Good morning.” But these St. Ursulans think just because
they got the American flag flying in the wind, that the Americans who come down here smiling up
in their face, like them... Well if they want to be ignorant, that’s their business. As for me, I ain't
saying a word.

I told you I been busy and I ain’t lying. From the night after I sneak off that boat, I been
working. To tell you the truth I didn’t even have a good night rest. Captain Armstrong dock the
vessel at four in the afternoon and told us to hide under the sugar sacks. There was three of us. Me
and two other fellows. One fellow was sick the whole way over and kept leaning over the side of
the boat to throw up all the food he had in he belly. Everybody laugh. But when he had to be
crouched up under them sugar bags with Vinnie and me and he start throwing up again, it wasn't
so funny. Because we had to stay there, not making a sound, smelling it... We could hear people
moving round upstairs. We could hear voices even. It was the immigration people checking to see
if they didn’t have any “illegals” as they like to call people like me. I could hear Captain Armstrong
saying, “You can search the boat if you all like. But I don’t traffic in stoways or illegals. I is a legit-
imate boat captain and my business is transporting merchandise.” But them immigration people
wasn’t listening too much. They still searching the boat from top to bottom. And they mighta even
been look behind all them sugar bags where we was hiding if it wasn’t for the smell of that puke
that Carl had vomit up earlier. I could hear one immigration man saying, “What's back there?” And
Captain Armstrong saying, “Just sugar bags.”

“What is that smell?”

“I don’t know sir. A rat or something musta die there.”

“Well it smell terrible. Let’s get out of here.” And they all went back upstairs.

Later that night, round eleven o'clock, Captain Armstrong come down to tell us that the coast was
clear. We went upstairs and a man named Lanclos take us in a truck and drive us up into the hills.
The night was hot and although there was some light everything look dark around us. I didn’t care.
I was glad to be off that boat and glad not to be smelling like puke any more. All I wanted was a
good night’s sleep. That was all. A good night’s sleep.

Lanclos stop us in a yard and show us to the back room of a ramshackle house. As my back hit
the floor I was fast asleep and thanking God for it.

But the shit was, I wasn’t sleeping two or three hours when a man was ringing a bell telling us
to wake our lazy asses up.

“Wha? What going on?” we ask. “Work!” the man say. “You people don’t think you here for your
good looks, do you? You here to work. And that’s what I’s taking you to. The job, Outside in the
truck we got coffee, but that’s all you get for free. Everything else you pay for.”
