“What?”

“Confront it. Those people can give you a lot of trouble and a lot of grief if they catch you. So
I'll call and report it tomorrow. I'll say I hired you and get a work permit for you.”

“Thank you, sir.”

That opening night Ralphie was working cleaning up tables behind the waiters.

“I didn’t know you was a singer,” he say to me.

“Oh, I been a singer a long time. I just didn’t tell nobody, that’s all.”

I could see that he didn’t believe me, but I don’t care. Fuck he. What is he anyway? A goddamn
busboy. Me, I’m a singer. King Mighty. And I got my picture out front to prove it.

The last time you write you told me bout trying to get that government job. Did you get it?

I have a new address as you can see at the top of this letter. You can write me there. But I think
that I's going to move again. So what I might do is get a post office box. That way no matter where
I living you can still write to me.

Say Hello to everybody,
Archie

Now “King Mighty” too

A NEW WORLD

Scobbo, Scobbo, Scobbo!

I writing you quick because I don’t want you to say that since I come this big shot singer celebrity
Tain’t been thinking bout my friends. Of course I joking bout the celebrity part, but things ain’t too
bad. No man, it ain't been too bad at all. I singing and practicing and learning songs. They got a
picture a me outside in front of the club and a picture of the band too. And the sign underneath say,
“Harry Band and the Rhythm Boys — featuring the Calypso Singing Sensation of Trinidad King Mighty 2 Shows
Nightly at 9:00 p.m. and at 11:00 p.m. Come one, Come all. At Bob Blick’; it's Carnival every night” The place
is doing okay for a new club. During the week we a little bit empty but on weekends we get a nice
crowd. Especially on Saturday night. Harry, who work in a lot of nightclubs, say he don’t think this
place gon last. He say for a place this size to make any kind of money we got to be doing a lot more
business. Maybe he right, maybe he wrong. I don’t know. But what I know is that Harry Bang is a
ignorant ass. He ain’t a bad musician, and play a good saxophone, but he ignorant like a rock. And
he ugly too. You should see this man Scobbo. He short and black and he got a big head, a big belly
and some thin, skinny legs. He look like a damn black frog with them big eyes a his. And he never

smile. Always got a mean expression on his face like he stomach giving him trouble or he smelling
