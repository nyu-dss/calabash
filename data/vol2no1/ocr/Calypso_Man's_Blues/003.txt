Somebody ask, “What time is it man?” because it was still dark outside “Four o'clock,” the man
tell us. And that’s when our day begin. Four o'clock in the fucking morning. They take you in a
truck, give you pick ax and shovels, and you start digging. You dig and you shovel and you move
rock and you cut down trees and you drink water and you piss and you dig some more and you
watch out for snakes and bugs and spiders and all kinds of other things. And at the end of the day
they take you back in the truck to that ramshackle house where a big fat ugly ass black woman with
titties flopping down her belly cook whatever she feel in the mood for and feed it to everybody. All
twenty one of us. Then we listen to the radio, drink if we want to and go to sleep. That’s how it
was for the first six months I been here. These people work us and pay us spit. Is some kind of
contract they got with the government for cutting country roads. The government don’t care who
they hire or how much they pay. So long as the work get done, that’s all they care about. These
people pay us pee pee and charge us for our food and the dirty room we staying in. Now, we don’t
have to stay there. We could move any time we like. Trouble is, none of us have any amount of
money to move because town ain't cheap. Plus, if you go in town and they find out you is a illegal,
they putting you in jail and shipping you right back.

So you see, Scobbo, people on St. Albans think St. Ursula is paradise. But it ain’t shit. Not if you
ain't born here. Not if you is one of us. But I gon persevere and I gon make it. I don’t care what
they do or what they try. I gon make it because I is a man with ambition. And that gon be the secret
of my success. Fucking, fucking ambition.

Tell your sister Sylvie hello. And your mother too. You people was good to me and I ain’t forget
bout you. Just because I didn’t write that don’t mean I ungrateful. I just mean I’m busy.

Talk to you soon,

I know, I know, | ain’t write for six months so you all give me up for dead. But I ain’t dead. I here
man. I here. And I got good news to tell you. I don’t work in the countryside no more, digging
ditches and gutters on the side of the road. I done with that. 1 show it my ass and I gone. But you
wouldn’t guess what I is doing now. Don’t even try because you wouldn’t be able to... I singing
Calypso. That's right, I singing Calypso and getting pay for it too. And I even got a new name to
go with it. My stage name is “King Mighty.” And when people ask me, “Mighty what?” I say, “A
mighty man with a song.”

I can hear you laughing already, saying, “But he can’t sing for fart.” But what I say to that is, “If
