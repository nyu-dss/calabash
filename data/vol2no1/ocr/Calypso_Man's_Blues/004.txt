I can’t sing, why is they paying me?”
Well to tell you the truth, I got the job as a kind of fluke. One weekend night me and some other
garrot boys come into town to booze up a little as we like to do when we finish our work for the

week and still have a little bit a payroll money in our pocket. We was in our usual rumshop, a lil dirty
place called Bosco’s. I got to talking to this other garrot name Ralphie. He tell me that he was quit-
ting this road work and I ask he why. He said for me not to tell nobody, but he was gon be moving
in town and getting a job as a busboy or waiter at this new night club that was gon be opening up.
I ask him how he hear bout the job and he tell me, “through a friend.” I ask he if he think I might
be able to get a job at the same place. He tell me he didn’t know but I could ask the man if I like.
Then he give me the name of the boss, a white man name Bob Blick.

That next Tuesday afternoon I fake like I was sick to get out of the road work and hitch hike my
way to town after I change out of my dirty work clothes.

In town I find the place. Carpenters and painters and mason men was still working there but the
man already had his sign up. It say: Bob Blick’s Carnival Club. 1 went in and ask for Mr. Blick. This
skinny white man come over to me. “Yes, what can I do for you?” Well, just before he walk over to
me I had heard him saying to somebody on the telephone, “What I need is a Calypso singer. That's
what I need. Somebody whose picture I can put in the showcase out front and I can advertise on the
radio. No, I don’t want a Latino singer or a pop singer. A Calypso man is what I’m looking for. Now
don’t call me unless you have one, okay? Things are crazy enough around here.” It was after that
when he come to me and say, what can I do for you.

“I looking for a job sir.”

“What kind of work.”

“Calypso singing, sir.”

“Calypso singing?”

“Yes sir.”

“Where are you from?”

“Trinny, sir. Trinidad. I used to sing Calypso in Trinidad. But since I come here | ain't been having
much luck.”

“What is your name?”

“Archie, Archibald De Witt. But my professional name is King Mighty. King Mighty the First.
That is the name I use when I singing.”

“King Mighty, huh?”

“Yes sit.”

“You got any pictures, any clippings, anything that tells me you are what you say you are?”

“No sir. I leave most of the stuff in Trinny. I figure that I would get a whole new start here.”

“So I have only your word and that’s it.”
