something bad all the time. The rest of the boys in the band ain’t bad. Most of them is quiet and
sensible except for the conga player named Costa. He is kind of a asshole too. So I don’t say much
to him. But Harry so ignorant and so sour that I don’t believe too much of what he tell me bout
anything. Especially bout the fact that the club ain’t making enough money to last.

Mr, Bob Blick don’t seem too worried neither. Most nights he sit at the bar and drink with his
friends or girlfriend. He don’t say much to us except to every once in a while come over and say,
“Good show, fellows. Good show.” Or sometimes when things is real, real slow he might come over
and say, “It doesn’t seem to make much sense to do a second show tonight. There’s just not enough
people. Why don’t we just pack it in?”

I know I tell you he was funny looking and stuff but he’s a nice man to work for. The waiters
and bartender say that he does get on them from time to time. Ralphie, the one who tell me bout
the job, he already quit. Say he ain’t making enough. Where he gone to, I don’t know. But Mr. Blick
don’t bother us musicians. He leave us alone completely.

Now Mr. Blick is funny. He got a girl friend. A heavy set white woman that come by to see him
a lot. But people tell me he’s a anti-man, so I don’t know what to make of it. On one hand, he got
this woman who come by to see him. They kiss and sit and talk and stuff. Then on the other hand,
he got fellows who by too. And they hug him and talk in high voice and whisper in his ear and
touch him on his leg and stuff. And some nights he leave with them early, saying they going other
places to drink and stuff. But Harry say that ain’t so. “They going some place to fuck and suck one
another. That white man is a anti-man. And all his friends is anti-man too.”

“Then what about his girlfriend Genna?”

“She is anti too. She is a anti-woman. You could see that in her face. That woman is a bull dagger.
He ain’t fucking she, he licking she. I work in hotels and clubs all over the place and I know white
people. Especially American white people. They is nasty people man. All of them. Nasty.” But like I
tell you Scobbo, Harry Bang is a ignorant fucker, so I listen but I don’t believe even half of anything
he got to say.

But this a new world to me, man. And I see a lot of things I ain’t seen before. And Harry, dumb
as he is, ain't too wrong bout the anti-man business. They got a lot of them around. A whole, whole
lot. All of them is white and a lot of them is good looking. And they like to go out with island boys.
I hear the fellows talking and they say these white men pay them for the island boys to sex them
like they was woman. And when they giving it to them they cry out and moan and beg for the boys
to give it to them harder. I can’t believe that because | don’t understand why a man would want to
be like a woman. I understand that if there ain’t no woman around a man might get to fooling with
another man pretending to hisself that that man is a woman or a girl. We used to do a little bit of
that up in the country because there wasn’t too much girls around. But the minute we could get a

woman we done with that. But these fellows here don’t want women. It got a lot of women running
