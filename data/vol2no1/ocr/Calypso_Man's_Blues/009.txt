around. Pretty women, but they don’t want them. And they don’t want other white men neither. Is
black boys they want. Is rusty ass looking dark boys they after, telling them how good looking they
is, how wonderful they skin is and stuff like that. The boys tell me they like to see their money first.
And that they won't let them white man kiss them. They will let them do other things for that
money, but they won't let them kiss them. Sometimes when the boys is in a bad mood they beat up
the white man after they finish sexing them. And they don’t beat them up for a reason. Is just the
fact that they don’t like them. They say when a man lay hisself to be like a woman like that, it make
them mad and disgusted. So they punch him up. Punch them up hard just to tell them they shouldn’t
be like that. A man is a man and he shouldn't try to act like a goddamn woman. But the other side
of that is they tell me that there is some men who ask the boys to beat them up. Can you imagine
that? Can you believe it? But they tell me it’s true. But like I telling you, this is a new world to me.
A whole, whole new world.

Now since I been singing at this place (it been nearly a month already. Can you believe that?), a
few fellows try to proposition me. Sometimes they invite me to the bar to have a drink with them.
Sometimes they ask if I want to take a ride with them in the country. This one man name Morey,
who like to come in the club every night, he ask me that question. When | tell him, “I don’t think
so,” he say to me, “What are you afraid of ? Me or yourself?” I said to the man, “Look, I know what
you is about. And I don’t play that.” Know what he say to me, Scobbo? Know what the man say to
me? He smile and say, “Don’t knock it till you've tried it. Who knows, you might like it. You might
even want to make it your way of life.” 1 didn’t say nothing because I didn’t know what to say to
the man. So I just say, “Excuse me,” and I leave. That was it. I just leave.

They say this island having some kind of tourist boom. And you see them all over. Tourist people
with straw hats and sun glasses. Big cruise ships come in three and four times a week and the tourist
them spread out all over the island taking taxis and spending money. We ain’t getting much a that
action in the club at night. Because by the time we open all of them already gone back to the ship.
Mr. Blick say business gon pick up when the word around. And he promise to do some radio adver-
tising too. So as you can see everything is going along good. Real good. You still didn’t answer me
about that government job. Say hello to everybody.
