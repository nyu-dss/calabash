Those Were My Young Green Days

Great Grandmother over me making sure I pounded
the cocoa beans right.
It took me all summer to learn,
Great Grandmother shook her head, said:
“Listen girl,
cocoa pods grow green,
ripen yellow,
mature purple,
burst them open with a stone,
look, like this,
eat the soft white insides;

Or grind them in a mortar

until the cocoa is your color,

roll into balls,

put to sun,

then drink cocoa-tea hot in the mornings.”

Huddled between Great Grandmother’s legs

as she combed my hair, she reached for

the pomade that made Mother hold her nose.
“But see here,”

Great Grandmother would cut her eyes,
hiss her teeth,

“Same oil you use to use,

but stop,

Kingston make you into fool-fool girl.
