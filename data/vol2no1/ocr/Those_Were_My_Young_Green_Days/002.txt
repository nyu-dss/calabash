Now be careful with Star Apples —
them will bind you up.
The big tree at the edge of our land
bear only purple fruit;
Some trees only green fruit.
Break the Star Apple open,
eat only the white part,

stay far from the pink part —
bind you bad girl.

At night you walking,

let somebody call to you twice before you answer —

never answer a first call.

Turn ‘round twice you pass silk cotton tree.
Rolling Calf start to run you down

make sure you reach junction before it

lie down like a star.

Spirits can take the shape of animals,
if you ever catch a fish that is too big,
have eyes that look strange,

put it back where you get it from.
Don't carry home stray animals,

one start to follow you home —

spin two times to confuse it.

Sunday you going to church, cover your head,
and I hope your mother don’t have you going
those none-soul churches in Kingston.

Learn first to dance a yard

before you dance abroad,

keep your head up high,

you will go far,

you is you great grandma’s child.”
