SMALL THINGS GOD

In previous centuries white men hunted

our darkness seeking unknown people.

Did our thirst begin with big colonial guns shooting
progeny of our enemies? Or did the hunger

for the sacred objects of the small things god

start during our enslavement, New World yearnings.

Once seen as free labor, dispensable, we yearned.
Doubled, now we live as hunter and the hunted.
Seek to please that greedy unappeasable tiny god.
Willing to risk everything, usurp our own people.
Our blind lust, needs deep like an unending hunger.
Some where on a back road, a park side shooting

begins. They start beating him but shooting

is preferred. No one witnesses this man’s yearning.
How does a woman, a mother’s hunger

burn turning a gift horse into the hunted.

Urban “have nots”. New World people.

Devotees they wait for the consumer gods.

Lost in a stranded Hyundai they seek any god.

They accept the man’s offer for a nde. Shooting

and cold leather of the Benz suv intoxicate these people
Was it for some back road in Georgia they yearned?
They collaborate like shadows just before death hunting,
stealing this suv like a gold necklace, like pure hunger.

So desperate they forget a child’s innocent hunger

to live free like the young man unable to find a god

large enough to protect, leaving him carrion of the hunted.
In the end it is easy pulling a trigger, shooting

in an urban western where the indian is an Indian yearning
for a life of promise etched in the hearts of his people.

Like hope or a dove’s sonorous mantra, a river of people
gather to remember him, leaving their tears of hunger.

A generation of multi colored have nots steadily yearn

for the false burnished copper of the “things” god.

They believe it will bring them wealth a life that can shoot
