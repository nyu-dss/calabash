past the time when we were poor, stranded hunters.
It used to be our people created black obelisk, powerful gods
our hunger demanded. Now we shoot up our own lives.

Yearning, adrift for centuries. Still we are the hunted.

*Based on a true incident where Rupingder Singh was killed
for his Benz SUV 7/28/01.
