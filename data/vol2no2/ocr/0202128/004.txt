Hell. The red flames are going to burn my hair first, and then my fingers and toes. It will
burn my stomach and between my legs last.

The fed flames make me cough and I open my eyes and get up. The man who
helped me fall rubs my back and smiles.

When I get back to my seat my grandmother hugs me. “Mi nifia, Dios te ha
visitado.” God has visited you.

I hold my breath against her stomach and wish that I could go inside it.
