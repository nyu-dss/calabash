Today I want to sleep with the Holy Spirit. I walk up to the front. I have to wait
on line. The man before me is big. So big that two men in suits stand behind him and
when he falls back, they catch him. They will only need one man to catch me.

I can smell the holy water. It helps me breathe deep. My heart is beating fast.

The pastor holds his hand against my forehead. His hand is wet. “Dios te pido que
le salve la vida a esta nifia.” He is praying so fast that I can not understand what he is
saying. I hear God, and Witness and Salvation, but I am not getting sleepy. Iam not
sleepy at all and I want to be sleepy and fall and sleep on the floor like everyone else. But
nothing is happening. I roll my eyes back trying to see the Holy Ghost. But I don’t know
what he looks like. Maybe he has feathers and wings. No, Leli, that would make it an
angel, and the Holy Spirit is not an angel. Maybe it’s a little boy. Whatever it is, I want to
see it and sleep with it. I want it to put its hand over my eyes and put sleep in me. And
then I want it to lie down next to me and to look at me while I sleep. I want it to look at
me and think that I am pretty, prettier than Yolanda and Mimi.

But as far back as I roll my eyes in my head I can not see the Holy Ghost. Iam
going to fall anyway. I don’t care if no one is there to catch me.

I let myself fall. I feel fingers under my armpits and hands helping me to the floor.
Iam not asleep. The Holy Ghost won’t come inside my body. I pray to God to forgive me
for lying. I just wanted the Holy Ghost inside me. I open my eyes a little and watch
someone else faint. I close my eyes. Inside my head there is red and a belt. There’s a
brown belt. It is my stepfather’s belt. I think the Holy Ghost wants a brown belt to hit me

to sleep. But now there will never be a Holy Ghost. Because now I am definitely going to
