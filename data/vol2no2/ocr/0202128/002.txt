I CANNOT SEE THE HOLY GHOST

I don’t like the church my grandmother goes to. There are no statues in this
church and the metal chairs are not comfortable. And today, Titi Nelly, the aunt that cries
all the time is coming with us. She cries when she watches movies or the news, and she
cries when she puts on this Spanish song about a man losing his mother. Sometimes she
sings the song and cries at the same time. I don’t like her very much because when Mami
leaves me with her, she makes me sit on the couch and won’t let me get up. The other day
I tried to read while the TV was on and she made me put my book away.

So now instead of playing with my friends I am in a dark church. The only thing
I like is that I have a tambourine. I don’t play it too good, but I like the way it sounds.
Sometimes I play it so much that I get little blisters filled with water on my palm. But
now the singing has stopped and the pastor has his eyes closed and is asking those who
would like a visit from the holy spirit to come up front.

Like always Titi Nelly walks to the front where the pastor is praying. He puts his
hand on her forehead and prays. Titi Nelly has her eyes closed too. The pastor prays
louder and faster and Titi Nelly falls back. A man in a suit behind her catches her and
gently puts her body down. The Holy Spirit has touched her and now she is sleeping with

god.
