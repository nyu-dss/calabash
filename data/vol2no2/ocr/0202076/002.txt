RESTITUTION

When I am dead

bury me in a raised grave
facing the bay of my birth.
Let me rest simply peacefully.

When I am dead,

give me back my hand-made
used tire sole sandals

worn off from walking

the long trying roads

the trade- winds had brought me to.

I will hold them tightly over my chest
while I walk again barefooted

on the dark red clay

of the hills of my youth.

Take my worthless manuscripts
of impotent libations,

but give me back my black magic,
my voodoo powers,

so I can dispatch rain clouds

to the thirst of my ancestors.

When I am dead, dress me

with a hat of my mother,
my father's watch, my grandfather's cane,

and bury me with my grand mother's
cloth coffee filter;

and were I to be cremated
transplant my heart first
into the trunk of a breadfruit tree.

When I am dead,
give me back to my memories,
