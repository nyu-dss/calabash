BLACK ENOUGH

I traveled to Paris and the pork free,

lactose intolerant sorority sister questioned

how could I walk the decadent grounds of Versailles
when I had not traced my Dahomey roots.

Even Dessalines danced the minuet.
Europeans swim in my blood, surfacing in Victors
who walked ahead of me, signifying beauty

with cafe-au-lait or mulatto skin, straight noses and silken plaits.

They left or were driven from

milkweed forests and sugar cane acres,

after learning the simplicity of dried cod tossed in vinegar
and served over commeal at midday.

Luxury was siesta, open air baths at dusk, lemon leaves scenting a tin basin.

Parisian men praised my pronunciation

while their women appraised my brown shell. Some secured
purse straps, pulled husbands closer

as we shared bridges arcing above the Seine.

Two centuries since we raised a flag,
rice farmers and professors sail wooden ships
through another middle passage.

I know the taste of Bordeaux, cr√©me brulee,
the sweetness of standing over Napoleon's tomb.
