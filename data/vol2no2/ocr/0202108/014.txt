My next project is well on its way. I have at least another 6 months or maybe a
year of work to go. It’s a novel. The main character is this young girl named
Dallas. It’s so hard to describe it because I haven’t talked about it before. It’s
about a young girl, Dallas, whose mother came to the US thinking that New York
was going to be like Dallas the show. It is a commentary on globalization and
how television is affecting the way American culture is perceived abroad. It is
told from this young woman’s perspective. She’s 17 years old, and she has a
really strong anti-school sentiment. All she wants to do is cut class, but she
discovers Barnes and Noble when she’s running away from the cops as a truant
student. In that place she discovers that she has the desire to learn, but she wants
to learn on her own terms. Basically that’s what it is, but it’s a lot of popular
culture commentary. The family is from the Dominican Republic. ’m obsessed
with my people.

Did you ever leave Washington Heights?

I went to the Upper East Side but I never left Washington Heights. Although I
was living in the Upper East Side I still had to call my mother every day and I had
to go visit her all the time although she kept thinking I never visited. I was there
twice a week. I moved back four years ago. I’ve stayed there. So, I was away
downtown Manhattan for three years and then I was away upstate in college three
years,

And when you came back from Binghamton, where did you come back to?

My mother’s house. I love my mother. My mother and I are so tight. People who
read the book do not deduce that I feel this about her. She’s the most amazing role
model, and she’s just brilliant. She’s smart and cultured. She loves everything,
she loves art, she loves books, we discovered books together actually. I came back
from college and began sharing with her my enthusiasm about Malcolm X and the
black experience. At first, she didn’t get it. Then I began to try to make her
aware of our racial and ethnic biases. I would say things like “mom, you can’t
say those things about Puerto Ricans,” and she would say “why not?” Then I just
started giving her books. I gave her When I was Puerto Rican, I gave her Breath

Eyes, Memory. I knew that I couldn’t change her mind. She would have to sort of
come to it on her own. And, all of the sudden, I’m sitting at dinner and my
mother’s like I had no idea Puerto Ricans were like us. I had no idea Haitians
went through all that.” I thought, my God, this is powerful. That’s why books are
so powerful.

 

 

Soledad is the novel of Washington Heights if ever there was one. I mean this is
like Comala in the novel by Rulfo or Washington Square for Henry James or
Garcia Marquez’s Macondo. Or one could think of it’s being, rather, your Mango
Street a la Cisneros. Is it the neighborhood or is it the street that moves you?
