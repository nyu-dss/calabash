Yes, and we got to know each other. He really cared, and he opened up my
consciousness about what it means to be mulata, and what it means to think about
identity. So I did this thing with him on television. He offered me an opportunity
to write a children’s story for Black Entertainment Television. I wrote the story. I
got to write four stories for the show, and he read them on television. My family
thought this was such a big deal. Then I felt that I could be a writer, and he said
“No, no, no. Now you’ve got to go to school,” and I took his advice. That was
the time when I was still trying to finish up my associates degree at FIT. Then I
applied to SUNY Binghamton. I knew that unless I left the city there was no way
that I was going to be able to go to school and really think about getting an
education or it could take me four more years, and I was terrified to be in school
that long. So I went to Binghamton, and I lost contact with him, which was fine
because I felt like he had served his purpose, which was to put me on the path.
He truly changed my life.

 

What happened at Binghamton?

When I went to SUNY Binghamton, I discovered African American literature. I
actually started with slave narratives and just fell in love with them. I learned
there that our people speak, that they have a history and have been documenting
our stories for ages.

Your saying “our people” suggest that you felt a sense of kinship with African
Americans.

Oh, completely! I never think of us as disconnected from the African experience.
I mean we are African diaspora and it is just that we have suffered different
geographic displacements. Someone told me the Dominican Republic was just
one big plantation. Imagine that. That’s our history, a history of plantation, and I
had never thought about it that way.

Actually the whole Caribbean can be seen as sharing a plantation experience that
has shaped the lives of people in the region.

I started with slave narratives. I had this teacher Carole Boyce Davies who was
teaching at Binghamton. I went to her and I said, “you know what Carole, I just
want to learn.” She said, “OK, start with Cristina Garcia and Sandra Cisneros.
She just threw books at me and urged me to read. I would then eat them up, and it
was amazing. When I read Sandra and Cristina I said, “Oh my God, Latinas also
can write.” I knew that they could write, I just didn’t know that they would ever
be out there or published in the world. I have read avidly since then. Because I
discovered literature so late, I feel like so much of the literature I read is
Caribbean, African diasporic which some people say is detrimental and many
even say that I’m not even educated. And this is a very interesting issue for me. I
was having this conversation with a very well known writer who said “you’re not
educated unless you read the Odyssey, and the Iliad, and Middlemarch, and I said
