community, even going back to the old country in the Dominican Republic, where
I have two younger sisters who I just started to get to know, simply don’t want to
talk about anything that has to do with their sexuality. I believe you’re putting
yourself in danger if you don’t talk about these things. I read this book recently by
Silvana Paternostro, Jn the Land of God and Man, in which she talks about how
silences are one of the reasons why the AIDS epidemic got so out of control
because people don’t talk about sex and they don’t talk about their bodies.

Everyone in the novel is copying or is affected by sexual experiences in
significant ways, even Dofia Sosa, even Ciego. I’m interested in Flaca’s
indictment of Soledad in moral terms. Flaca decries Soledad’s slutting around.
One might first see Flaca as just a little street girl without much of a moral code,
but then she is the one condemning Soledad’s sluttishness. I suppose one could
say she does so out of resentment about the relationship between Soledad and
Richie. But I find an interesting irony in her moral stance.

Actually, the KIRKUS reviewer of the book called Flaca a slut, and I thought that
was such a misinterpretation of her. I feel that at 14, which is Flaca’s age, the time
of the discovery of your sexual self, she is quite restrained. I believe the same
reviewer went on to describe the novel’s plot as basically a parade of prostitutes,
hand readers, and magicians, which I thought so grievously misrepresented my
work. It was just a really bad review. I never thought of Flaca as a slut. She
doesn’t even have a first kiss in the book. She wants Richie to be her first kiss.
She starts discovering her body and to react to its urges, but, ultimately, she does
not go wild. She has boundaries, and she has rules in her head.

The story of Soledad deals with a return, a daughter’s return to the mother. First
the daughter returns to the forsaken mother and then follows the rehabilitation of
their relationship. The males in the novel for the most part suck.

Except for Richie and Ciego, of course.

Ciego actually is a remarkable character that reminds me of Tiresias in the
Oedipus story. You will recall that in the play by Sophocles Tiresias, who is
physically blind, confronts Oedipus, charging him with blindness. Tiresias lacks
eyesight, but can see the things that escape the king, whose vision is blurred by
his sense of self-righteousness, and despotic authority, an exacerbated self-
importance. I warmed up to the character of Ciego and enjoyed all the irony of his
ability to appreciate the landscape. This otherwise gloomy urban landscape
appreciated by a blind man. Why this character?

He was born in my dreams. This is also one of those miracles. I felt that Dofia
Sosa, a woman so much like my grandmother, this amazing woman with “tanto
gusto por la vida,” had to express herself. Something happens to women when
they get older. Their sexuality is supposed to shut down, as if it can be turned off
like a switch. I think about what can be going through an older woman’s mind. I
