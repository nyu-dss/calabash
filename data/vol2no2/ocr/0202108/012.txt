It’s more like your recognition of the power of others

Yes, I think that’s what it is. I see it with kids all the time, young kids. If you
believe they’re dumb or that they’re not going to get it, they won’t get it. And it’s
not even something that has to be said. If you really believe they’re going to get
it, they will because they could get it. They have the power in them. The problem
is with us not believing they have the power to change

You said the manuscript of Soledad went through several transformations. What
is your method? How do you work?

Initially, when I started writing I didn’t know what I was doing. I started writing
from the gut. I was channeling a lot in dreams. I would go to sleep with
problems and think about my characters. They would meet people in the dreams
and they would come alive in the book. But then you can do that only so much. It
gets very messy because then I had tons of people. You know I grew up around a
very busy street, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted the book to be about a community
or about a family or about this woman. So I did a lot of writing just putting stuff
down on paper. Then I read it through. I separated the novel in parts, laid it all
out around my room and then picked the parts that I thought were linking up. I
have a story. These things are linking up. When I did that I tried to put the novel
back together again and read it through again. Then rewrote the entire thing again
and again. Then, of course, I had good readers who are good friends. They read
the novel and gave me feedback. I rewrote it again. It’s a lot of rewriting. For me
writing is all about rewriting and rewriting.

Do you have any trepidation about the likelihood of a major success and its
possible repercussions on your life?

I have a bad relationship with money. I don’t like it in my life. I have this fear of
being a bourgeois and of people seeing me as one. I do exactly what I love every
day. How many people can say that? Very few. But I think if I have great
success, and I have some money, I can buy my mother anything she wants so she
could retire. That’s the goal. I wish I could do that for her. Do I want lot things?
No, that is not important to me. I would love to be able to live this life for ever,
which means having enough money just to get me by so I can write my stories.
But I do fear the fate of so many young writers who get fame and then get
blocked. That’s scary to me. But I thank God that so many young writers have
already paved the way. I don’t think I have the same pressure as they did being
the first Dominican writer or the first Haitian writer or the first to come out in the
world. I feel now that as a Dominican writer in the US, I belong to a community. I
also feel that I just want the right people to be able to read my book, like young
women like me, and young guys around the neighborhood. Ultimately, the real
question is how do you live your life as an artist? Pm always asking “Am I
happy?” “Am I living the kind of life I want?”
