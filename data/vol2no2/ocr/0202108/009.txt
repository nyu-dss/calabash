linguistic blocs. I contend that Dominicans and Puerto Ricans are a lot more
Caribbean than they are Latin American although they are part of both. In that
respect they are culturally more complicated than their Anglophones,
francophone, and even than Dutch- speaking counterparts because they actually
have their feet in two cultural spaces. So, I agree with your view of Caribbean
identity.

I remember just taking it all in. I spent five intense weeks working with these
people every day, and I felt blessed. I mean Antonio Benitez-Rojo was there, who
wrote The Repeating Island. There were just tons of Caribbean artists, scholars,
thinkers. I remember thinking, my God; this is a connection that we don’t often
make. I thought of how separated our communities are, how rarely West Indian
and Dominican communities come together, and have the opportunity to see how
much we have in common geographically, our rhythms, everything. So to me,
that was a big shift of consciousness.

At what point did you begin thinking that you were a writer?

So, I was there and it was a writing workshop and, again, I guess I needed
confirmation that I had talent. Earl Lovelace was so supportive. He said to me
“you got it, this is a novel, a novel waiting to be written, you got to keep going”
So I ventured into writing a novel. Someone said, “You have to go to an MFA
Program” and assured me that I could get funding. I ended up at NYU doing my
MFA with funding. I would have never done it without funding because to me it
all seemed such a luxury.

So it seems like it was a change of lifestyles also. You switched from being an
income-producing, self-sustaining grown up to being a student dependent on the
minimum income financial aid recipients scrape up for their support.

I realized that a lot of the money that I was making when I was working full time
was spent on things that I didn’t need, like clothes, music, going out to dinner,
and taking cabs. I realized that my mother made half of what I made and she was
able to support us and save money. That’s when I made that shift of
consciousness, when I understood that I didn’t need to have those things.

So you liberated yourself from the throes of consumer consciousness.

Completely. It changed my life. Grace Paley said that “the best thing a writer can
do is think low overhead,” and it’s so true. The best thing that occurred to me was
knowing that I don’t need that much. As soon as I learned to live really simply
with very little and not care about what people thought about that choice, I was
free. Believe me, my family was not very accepting of the fact that I didn’t have
the basic stuff like health insurance. But I said, I am going to do what I love.
