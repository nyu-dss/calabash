Are you not afraid you might end up living a life in which your success in the
market might be unreachable as has often happened with the most commodified
minority authors who’ ve become intellectual superstars.

Well I think I learned an interesting lesson from Bill Cosby. Meeting him ten
years ago was so great for me because I realized I don’t ever have to fear that, and
I don’t ever need to want that. It was reassuring to see that someone with his fame
can talk to anyone and really treat you like a human being and connect. That’s a
great lesson. It doesn’t matter where you are at and how much money you have,
you can still connect. But I also realized his struggle as an artist. Every artist I
meet, it doesn’t matter how many books they have, they’re still in the same place.
They still need to worry about their next great idea. They still need to ask
themselves “am I doing the kind of work that matters or is anyone going to care?”
In the end, when you start a project you’re in the same place. You might have
more backing. You might have more money. You could probably afford to take
more risks. But still you’re in a very similar place, inside of the artist’s permanent
struggle with the challenges of the craft.

In a sense you’re still wrestling which ways to tackle the art. But it’s still unclear
how it is that creation happens for you.

Well, what’s clear is that it is totally hard work. I think I write from the body. I
don’t know how to explain it. I am outing myself here for not speaking like an
intellectual. They’re some people who can quote great writers and break down a
story in a certain way and deconstruct things. I’m not like that. I read books, I
take them in, I feel them and then I sort of purge. I was talking to a friend about
this. He is a musician and he plays by reading music. He improvises but he plays
by reading music. He says of course there are geniuses who play just by ear, and I
say, if we were to put it in writing terms, I would be a writer who writes by ear.
That’s the way I approach writing in the sense that to me I listen a lot to language
about what people are feeling, and then it comes from a very emotional place. On
the other hand, I think there are writers who write as if they were reading music.

Why did you become a novelist as opposed to a poet, an essayist, or a short fiction
writer?

Again, it was all accidental. I didn’t choose. I don’t think I am a poet. It just never
comes up. Short stories? I need more space than short fiction can offer. Cristina
Garcia told me once “I love novels because you can be messy,” and I think I am
messy in general. The way I think made me think it usually takes a lot of space to
say things. When I was writing the book, I was putting stuff on paper and people
kept saying “this looks like a novel” must be a novel, then, I’m writing a novel. I
thought I should take it seriously because a novel is a serious thing.

when will your next project see the light?
