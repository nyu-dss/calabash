I’m obsessed with the neighborhood. I think that in this particular novel, though,
the street predominates. I feel that there is so much division from one block to
another. Washington Heights is changing a great deal through gentrification. I
almost feel like 20 years from now we’re not going to be there anymore. Little by
little Dominicans are being pushed out. Yes, there was a very violent time in
Washington Heights. But there is also very much of the immigrant intensity of
just believing in the dream, and the informal work structure, and the community
buildings that make it feel like another world that you don’t really experience
anywhere else in New York City. So I felt that I wanted to give something back to
the people there. I wanted to document it in some way.

I had the sense that the novel is about a place as much as is about people. You
know, I’m thinking about the emphasis on the buildings, the roof tops, sidewalks,
and so on, which makes for a very place-based story. Are you finished with
Washington Heights?

No, Ihave like 5 more novels about Washington Heights.
Do you feel that you know the Dominican community?

I only know my friends from the Dominican community. I feel like I’m part of it.
To say I know the Dominican community is problematic because my uncles and
my mother are like “ta no sabes por qué te fuiste.” One of my uncles is always
accusing me of not knowing Washington Heights, he went to college at UCLA
and SUNY Brook for eight years, but still he feels that he knows Washington
Heights. He doesn’t realize that he left for eight years, but he realizes that I left
and I think those people who leave never feel they’re absent just because they left.

I’m taken by Soledad’s kind of outsider’s gaze when she comes to the
neighborhood, namely the sharpness of her observations, her ability to make out
the outline of ordinary objects in the surroundings. I think she shows an ability
which is a privilege of the outsider more than the insider unless we’re prepared to
say that the artist is the quintessential outsider whether or not he or she lives in the
community. What do you think?

I think that those are two good points. I think that her leaving and coming back
endows Soledad with an enhanced perception. She can say to others “I’ve seen
something you haven’t.” Also Soledad has been opened to a wider world. She’s
open to having a gay friend. She has chosen to be an artist, knowing that her
family might never accept her because she’s not choosing a job that would help
the family or serve as a move to a higher class. The artist is an outsider because
art. Art, in its best form, will be questioning the status quo and when you do that
you remain outside.

I think of those telling passages that describe roofs in the neighborhood or
sneakers hanging from street-lights and traffic signs. It seems to me those images
