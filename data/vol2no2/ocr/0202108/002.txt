WRITING HAS TO BE GENEROUS:
AN INTERVIEW WITH ANGIE CRUZ

I would like us to begin speaking about your name, “Angie.” Is it your name as it
was given or an endearing shortening of “Angela”?

I like to think of it as a name that came out of resistance because of the way my
mother and father got married which was not completely an agreement with her,
but more like an arranged marriage, you know, tipo dominicano. Here comes this
guy from New York who does very well; “you should marry him,” her family said
and she did for the family’s sake. When she came to New York, and I was born,
he wanted to call me Angela, but my mother didn’t want to agree with anything
he wanted. So she called me Angie.

Your answer brings to mind one point in Soledad where one learns that Olivia’s
father is anxiously waiting for her to grow up so she can be married off to
someone, and I thought I should ask you this question: Can we really attribute
arranged marriages to the Dominican Republic?

I think that’s the easiest way to translate what I have seen happen to so many
women in my mother’s generation, which is probably still happening now, though
I am not that in touch. We don’t call it that --- arranged marriages --- but what do
you call it when you have all these young girls whose families pressure them into
marrying for either better lives or education or to come live in the States?

Perhaps marriage of opportunity or convenience more than out of anything one
might call “love.”

You might be right!
Give us your date and place of birth.

I was born on February 24th, 1972, in New York City’s Washington Heights at
Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.

How would you characterize your childhood?
