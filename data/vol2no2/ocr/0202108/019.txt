thought we need a man to complete Dofia Sosa. Ciego really started as a vehicle
for her, and then he became alive, this person who’s the neighborhood’s
philosopher in some ways. He also serves to balance the character of Victor,
whose father is not present and for whom he fulfills the role of a father figure. But
also, I didn’t want Victor to be an asshole, so through the contact with Ciego he
starts in the end to see the world in a different way.

You have populated the novel with very powerful women: Olivia, Gorda, Dofia
Sosa, Carmel, even Flaca, low-income urban Amazons. One finds them putting
up a courageous fight against adversity. You have constructed a sort of arena
where these women confront demons that come from society and from their souls.

It’s so funny because I didn’t conceptualize it that way. I don’t think that way. I
just started writing and the residues of all the different powerful women I know
just surfaced.

relationship with your neighborhood, I wonder why you created a character with
this very tense rapport with her mom and who at the beginning hates Washington
Heights, feeling for the most part that she doesn’t belong there. Were you trying
to rehearse a reality that differed radically from yours?

You start writing fiction when you let go of the autobiographical and start making
things up. I remember something that Junot said to me, “you should not be afraid
to have someone hate Washington Heights”. I started thinking about how
interesting it would be to create a character that hates my neighborhood despite
my loving relationship with it. I thought the challenge would be to make this
really believable. A lot of people come back and they hate the neighborhood or
are just embarrassed about it. That wasn’t my case, but for a lot of people that’s
really true. So I said ok, that’s the character I want to write. I want to write about
someone who hates it and falls in love with it in the end.

The novel opens with this little passage in which you have us kind of read
Olivia’s interior, and the book closes with a scene in the lake with Olivia coming
back to waking life just as Soledad seems to have descended into a sort kind of
dreamworld. Soledad remains very awake through the first half of the novel and
she becomes less and less awake while Olivia snaps out of the catatonic condition
that has imprisoned her since the beginning of the text.

I feel like Soledad and Olivia are almost the same person. It’s like a cycle and the

fact that one wakes up and the other sleeps sort of shows two facets of their
experience. I see one side of Soledad dying and a new side being born. It’s like
the ultimate /impieza to me, with her falling into the lake and Olivia now getting a
chance to being listened to.
