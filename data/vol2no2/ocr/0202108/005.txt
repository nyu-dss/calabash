She wasn’t happy. She felt like it was a personal attack because she’s still of the
old school, though she is modernizing a little bit now. But she said “ why are you
going to leave when you can stay here and save money until it’s time?” I was so
young. I think when I finally moved out I turned 19. But she also knew that there
was no way she could hold me back. I was making more money than she was, so
she had to admit that her little girl was ready.

You had the credentials of a firm location in the job market.

She was probably afraid, afraid for me, thinking that now I had an apartment, that
I might start sleeping around, you know, all the things that worry overprotective
Dominican parents. They think you can’t be alone or someone’s going to take
you.

Well, I myself confess to some of that. I don’t want my children’s pictures
appearing in a milk carton. If it comes to a choice, I’d much rather have them
traumatized by the limits I impose on them. But, of course, you can’t deal with
young women that way when they become old enough to know what they want.

Well, the thing is too that my mother’s fears were so much informed by the
thought of losing me to men, when, really, I was so preoccupied with how I was
going to pay the rent that I didn’t even have time to think about who I was going
to get lost with. So I feel her fears had little to do with my reality.

You said you discovered writing?

Yes.

But first you must have discovered books.

Actually, no. It was really the other way around. I always feel like the most
fraudulent writer on the planet because I did not experience a literary calling to
speak of. I went to art school, so you would think that art was part of my life.
Would that explain why the character of Soledad is an artist?

I made Soledad an artist because when I was in art school I never thought that I
could be an artist. I just thought art was a subject for classes I could take. I
thought artists were Picasso and Goya, all of these dead white men. I never ever
saw myself as an artist. But I could see myself as a fashion designer because

there is Oscar De La Renta. It’s this simple. It was so simple in my head.

Oscar de la Renta’s being Dominican gave you confidence, which would suggest
that for you the barrier to art was more one of ethnicity than of gender.
