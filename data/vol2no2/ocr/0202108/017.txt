I took a class, as I have said, with Carole Boyce Davis, and this woman was
amazing even though I knew nothing of her before I went to her office. Then
came the contact with Cristina Garcia while I was in Mexico. She was another
person who I just found without planning it. I didn’t really have any way of
reaching someone like Julia Alvarez. Also I realized that it is through working
that you forge relationships. I formed my own writing organization: Women In
Literature and Letters (WILL). Sometimes we place too much emphasis on
finding a famous writer to help us with a book. I don’t find it’s always the most
crucial thing to try to find these established people to mentor us. I think that in
our peer groups there are some people who are really great readers and who have
more time to really give back to each other. We can have more of a peer- like
relationship and give and take from each other. Junot Diaz, who is Dominican,
has been really helpful.

Your novel could be read as Olivia’s story even though its title refers us to the
character of Soledad.

Well this is interesting. I had a hard time with the title. I chose Soledad as the
title is because I feel that she brings together the plights of all these women who
share the same location. I thought also that Soledad (loneliness) sort of
corresponds with a theme of the novel. Soledad is the vehicle for every other
character to connect. Olivia is very much alone in her story. No one knows her
story, and Gorda is very much alone in her story. No one else knows it. She deals
with every one but no one knows what’s really going on inside of her. Similarly,
Dojfia Sosa goes through all these things that boil inside of her but no one really
knows about them. It’s the lack of communication among these women that sort
of creates a common isolation, which I thought the character of Soledad
encapsulated.

Is it the isolation of the human condition?

It could be. Sometimes either we don’t want to or we just don’t make the time to
find out what’s going on inside of people. I remember growing up and feeling
there was so much I couldn’t tell my mother. I feared that if I told her she would
hate me or not accept me. Now I tell her about all those years, and she says, “y
por qué no me dijiste; eso no era nada.” Imagine all the emotion and anxiety I
carried because I was afraid of telling her things that for her turned out to be no
big deal. I just feel like I would love to see more places created to talk about

sexuality among Latinas. Everything from the very basics onward.

Do you find that there’s something particular about Latina sexuality that needs
attention?

Well because I’m Latina I’m talking about my experiences as if the world

revolves around me. I had no idea that there was anything else. I thought everyone
was Latino until I left Washington Heights. But I think the women in my
