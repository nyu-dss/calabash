Yes, it seemed so at that point in time because art was so far-fetched, a thing for
other people, a white thing, a European thing.

No one ever told me while I was in high school that there was Frida Khalo, or
Diego Rivera or Romare Bearden, anything that’s connected to my life. But I
knew there was Oscar De La Renta who is Dominican. I thought, well, maybe I
too can do it, and I sort of just took that path. So books, there were some. I
mean, I read some books during high school, but while I was in high school I was

working 30 to 40 hours a week so I didn’t really have a sense of the intellectual
life.

You worked your way through high school whereas many people feel they can
brag about working their way through college, as did Richard Nixon in his famous
“Checker’s” speech.

I had to work. We were so financially strapped. And, of course, growing up here
we were such consumers. We were young and wanted things, but we knew our
mother couldn’t afford to give us that much. We were such a tight unit: me, my
brother, and my mother. My brother worked. I remember him working 50 hours
at Wendy’s downstairs to just help pay the bills, because my father was definitely
financially hands off. I didn’t think about books. Here is my story about how I
started writing: I was working at a cashmere store on Madison Avenue that would
get celebrities walking in all the time. One day Bill Cosby walked in. ’'m going
to shorten the story because it is very long. Basically he said to me one day
“what is it that you do?,” and I said “what do you mean?” He actually asked me
what I did, and no one ever asks salespersons what they do, what they want, what
do they dream. You are just the salesperson. I said “well, I study fashion design,
but,” and he goes “but, I hear a but, what’s the but?” I answered “I don’t know,”
but he continued prodding “what do you want, what do you want?” I finally said,
“You know, I wish I could be a bohemian artist or a writer or something.” He then
asked “if you were a writer, what would you say?, What do you want to say?” I
realized I didn’t know. “Perhaps I would talk about this guy that I saw in the train
today and it pissed me off that he couldn’t get something to eat.” I really didn’t
know how to express my concerns; I didn’t know how to articulate ideas. All
these things I learned in college about ideology, and racism, were things for
which I didn’t have the language. I only had the feelings. I reacted to
marginalization, to being a Latina and not being around Latinos as often, to
leaving home and feeling that my family felt this rejection because I left. So I had
a lot of stories but I didn’t know I had stories. All I knew is that if I could write
and express myself. Cosby very firmly said, “OK, then write, write!” He gave me
this photograph of himself, and on it he wrote “write!” He was just so kind. Fora
while he would nurture me and he would ask, “Are you writing, are you writing?”

He would drop by regularly?
