but is it really fair to say that? Have you read all of Toni Morrison, and all the
works of James Baldwin? I think that sometimes we put so much weight on the
canonical writings and forget other things.

I would add that often we are obsessed with only one particular canon, namely the
Western canon. The writer you allude to will probably not insist on our reading
the great works of other cultures, Chinese culture, Japanese culture, Arabian
culture, Persian culture. So theirs is not really a concern with knowledge but a
predilection for the knowledge produced by the West.

Right. So I’ve been obsessed with reading history books because literature
opened for me all the questions about the past. I started reading books about
Cuba and the Revolution. I was fascinated by the Revolution and how it
happened. I asked myself “when is our revolution going to happen?”

Help me with the chronology here. You went to Binghamton in 1994, having
finished at FIT the previous semester. You then came out of Binghamton with a
BA in 1997, and you were about to describe how you got to thinking that you may
want to be a writer as opposed to just writing without a clear purpose.

Well, I must mention Carole Davis again. She is another angel in my life. I feel
like I have angels. She has said, “Angie you should apply to this Caribbean
Writers Workshop.” It was the Caribbean Writers Summer Institute at the
University of Miami in Florida that Sandra Pouchet Paquet used to run. I caught
was there the last year. I did not think I would get in, but Carole insisted, and I
got in. I got a fellowship and I worked with Earl Lovelace. I love his writing and
it was amazing to be with him for a semester.

I often teach his novel Zhe Wine of Astonishment.

That’s the first book of his that I read. It was a real treat because I had never been
around a writer of color and seen so many writers of color and Caribbean writers.
It made me realize too the complexity of my cultural kinships. I had read some
Latino and Latin American literature. A lot of the U.S. Hispanic literature that’s
published. Of course, there’s Julia Alvarez, but her story is not similar to mine.
There’s Junot Diaz, but he is a boy even though I love Junot. But when I was
there I was thinking about how the Latino identity here in the US is very Chicano-
centered. Then, when I was at this Caribbean conference around Bahamians and
Jamaicans, anglophones, francophone and Dutch Caribbean people, I realized that
Dominicans and Puerto Ricans are more Caribbean than Latin American. We
don’t often see it because we try to disassociate from our African ancestry. I feel
like it has to do a lot with the indigenous vs. the African ancestry connection. I
don’t know if you agree.

Well, the issue comes up as a central argument of my book Caribbean Poetics,
which tries to show the Caribbean as a culture area that is made of different
