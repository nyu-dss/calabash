really graphically insisted upon in that unleashing of the naked men. Where does
that come from? Or, how would my daughter say, “What’s up” with that?

It really was about sometimes we see things and we don’t feel anything but how
about if we really read something, and then, all of the sudden, it comes alive and
is almost a testament to the power of words and how you document something. It
does keep it alive. So her desire to know who her father really was kept this thing
in her room. So it was sort of playing with that idea.

Did you not fear that the scene might become a little bit comical?

For me it was disturbing, and it was disturbing to write. I wasn’t even thinking
comical. I hope it doesn’t read as comical. When I was writing it I was having a
hard time sleeping. I kept thinking my God, if Soledad could just feel an ounce of
what her mother could have been experiencing! That’s all I wanted.

Olivia when she’s thinking of her past and regretting things, the one thing that she
resents the most is the years with Manolo. Its almost as if the years with Manolo
take precedence over everything else.

And I think the reason that happens is because Manolo sort of made her believe
that she was finally safe. And then she was completely betrayed and deceived.
With Manolo, it was like you’re one of my kind and that’s like the ultimate
betrayal when you feel like someone who’s supposed to be on your side does this
thing to you. Manolo was supposed to be the person who was saving her.

Angie Cruz, thank you for this interview.

My pleasure.
