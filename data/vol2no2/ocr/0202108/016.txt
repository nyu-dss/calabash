do not jump at you if you are a regular resident if the neighborhood. You need
some degree of “outsiderness” to come see them as distinguishable images.
Reading Soledad, I feel that for the first time I get to see people spitting --- that
urban youth spitting --- that is so evocative of street codes and attitudes. That you
should set out to capture details of the sort as something worth recording in your
narrative must take a special look, a special distance, I would think.

You know, I’ve taken different workshops with different writers who say that
when they leave their communities they can write best about them because all of
of sudden they really can see. They go back and they’ve seen everything. They
can actually smell what things smell like. When you are in a smelly room, you
don’t smell it anymore, but if you leave and come back, you are like, “Uh!” I
think that being away and just traveling and seeing other social realities will
sharpen your vision.

In the novel there’s a kind of hyper awareness of skin color and hair texture in the
novel, particularly in Soledad’s own mind. Is it color that sets Soledad apart from
her family, causing her initial distance from it? When the novel opens she’s
coming back, but she’s been away, she has been distant, she has rejected this
setting and the setting involves all of the area, the place as well as the people. Do
you see a connection there?

I think if she had been a white Latina girl who was embarrassed by her
neighborhood, it wouldn’t be such an issue. She didn’t trust the girls from the
neighborhood, and she didn’t act like those girls or dated the guys from the
neighborhood. Those attitudes just set her farther apart and she chose to be an
artist and she chose to move out, I think that set her apart even more than color.
But I think color really matters. Also I think hair texture does make a big
difference. She has straight hair. I grew up with curly hair. Forever in my life
they straightened my hair. They didn’t even know how to comb my curly hair
when I was a kid. They would straighten my hair because they didn’t know what
to do with it. None of us looks related. We are a mix of things. But I feel girls
with straight hair have a certain privilege in the neighborhood, and I feel that also
sets Soledad apart in the novel in a way. I think that a lot of Soledad’s feeling like
an outsider has to do with her light skin, but she in the end accepts Washington
Heights culture. The thing about color is that the people in my family are
obsessed with it. They say they’re not but they are. Someone walks by and you
hear comments like, “mira qué blanca” “Ay qué morena!” “Qué nariz tan
perfilada.” It’s like an obssession.

I noticed in your acknowledgement page a very wide range of debts that you

acknowledge. How would you describe the kind of support you received from
more established writers?
