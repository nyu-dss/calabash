I’m impressed by the novel’s presenting us with what I would call a landscape of
the quotidian, a canvas of urban, inner city everyday life that you can see as if it is
spread before your eyes. It does it in a very convincing way. But now, let me turn
to a question about the meaning of home. Is home a site? Home seems to be a site
of trauma. All of Soledad’s problems can be traced to home in a sense and yet in
the end Soledad goes back to her origins, an essential source that she needs to
connect with. First she goes from Greenwich Village to Washington Heights as a
kind of homecoming. Then, to complete her cycle, she needs to recover some kind
of ancestral home by coming going back to the Dominican Republic.

Cristina Garcia talks a lot about that. In Dreaming in Cuban, Pilar, the character
who finally goes home to Cuba, thinks this is home. She had left there when she
was two years old. I think that as immigrants and coming from immigrant
families, we have the idea of home so present in our every day life. We talk about
the ancestral homeland all the time, about going home there or about relatives
there or about things that we are sending back. It is very easy to romanticize that
place that’s home especially if we don’t feel completely accepted where we live. I
was never American enough in this country or I was never Dominican enough
over there. So where do you go? It is nice to know you have another place
elsewhere that you can call home to balance emotionally any animosity you
encounter in this country even though you may not be accepted entirely there
either.

At one point Manolo gets sexual with his daughter or with the girl named Soledad
yet not much is made of that incident in the story. One could understand
Soledad’s angst without necessarily associating it with sexual abuse. I mean, from
her everyday life there appears to be no clear indications of trauma, of scars, of
hurt of a particularly sexual nature. Her search for something, her longing, could
be understood in any number of other ways. Why is it that this, which in many
novels would be “the thing,” is not “the thing” here?

Ive done a lot of work with women and women writers and the issue of sexual
abuse comes up really often and you’re often surprised. You find yourself saying,
oh my God, I would have never guessed it happened to you. I think there are
things we really don’t talk about, but so many of the women I know have been
sexually abused. We all look like we’re ok, we are not going around crying every
five minutes “I was sexually abused,” but it’s still part of our every day life that
we know it happened. I felt with Soledad it would be more powerful to show it
that way instead of making it “the thing.” Imagine this girl, on top of everything
she has to deal with, she also has that, but she can’t even deal with that because
there’s all this other stuff going on. I think in some ways by not making it the
central part, it makes her less special since, in truth, she is not an exception.

I would love for us to speak about the mangu scene, the wonderfully erotic mangu

scene. Spirits and the magical get unleashed at the end. Let me just ask you two
things, one, the centrality of sex is there but the magical is also central and it gets
