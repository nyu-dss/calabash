Do you now think of yourself as a writer? When people ask you what you do, do
you say, “Pm a writer”?

It is still really embarrassing. I don’t know why, but it feels very embarrassing
because all of the sudden if you say that you are a writer people think you’re
important. But ’'m thinking it’s not so. If you start writing one page at a time you
also will have a book if you stick to it. I think people work that up a lot and so
much of it is luck. So much of it was being at the right place at the night time and
meeting people who changed my life. So I feel like that Soledad was created by a
community of people, not just me, and also all my mother’s sacrifices and my
grandmother’s stories and all their love. I have an intense supportive family.

I remember Toni Morrison saying once that it took several books for her actually
to feel confidence saying “I’m a writer,” and recently I spoke with Rita Dove who
said something similar, that it took her quite a while to say “I am a poet” as
opposed to, well, “ I write poetry.”

That’s how I feel. I don’t want to take myself so seriously. There is so much
freedom in just saying, OK, I’m trying something new and don’t take me that
seriously because it is not finished. And is anything ever really finished because
writing is such an involved process. Some people can read my book and hate it.
All I can say is, well, that was just my process, and ’m now moving on to other
things.

Do you have literary models that you recognize?

I felt that Soledad went through so many transformations because I was
discovering writing and literature at the same time. So it was really an intense
dialogue that I was having with all these books that I was reading. Initially I felt
that Sandra Cisneros was just a really big influence on my work. Then I read
Toni Morrison, and I was obsessed with the way she deals with the magical in our
everyday lives. Then I read Cristina Garcia with her shifts of point of view. I feel
a strong connection to all these writers. I feel the writing in Soledad does have a
really strong sense of “Caribbeanness”. A lot of people say it’s “circulatory,” and
a lot of Caribbean writing that I read has this circulatory feel in that it all comes
back around. Life, death, past, future, you know all that. I feel that Caribbean
literature has been a really strong influence on me. Books per se, no, I am not
really linked to any one book.

How about negative models? Do you have models that you don’t want to
resemble? Are there texts that you are glad you did not write?

There is some writing that’s really non emotional and writing that I don’t feel has
a service to render a community to some extent or doesn’t show generosity. I
don’t know. To me writing has to be generous. It has to in some ways give back
an idea or suggestion, something, for change. I guess that’s where all my politics
