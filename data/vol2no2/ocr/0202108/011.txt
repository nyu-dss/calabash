come out. I really want to finish a book and say: OK, now, what do we do from
here? Where is this taking us? There’s, I think, a lot of writing, especially writing
that I see now by young people, which I became aware of especially when I was
in the MFA programs, that is largely word acrobatics, really clean, unemotional,
and ironic. That’s the kind of stuff that I want to stay away from.

That’s probably the sort of writing that tries to show familiarity with the trendiest
of thoughts. But let’s ask the question differently, what kind of aspirations do you
harbor? What kind of book do you want to do? When you set out to tackle a
writing project, what is the goal that you seek to achieve?

Can I grow up a little more? I feel that’s one of my obsessions. How does change
happen? I feel like the world is falling apart. Everywhere you look there’s one
terrible thing happening, even in my immediate circles. P’ve seen my younger
cousin. They are doing so much worse than we were in the sense that they’re not
interested in anything. They just seem filled with despair, like all they care about
is shopping and having new things. They’re so superficial, but I know they’re
good kids. If only they saw a moment in time where they can feel they have
dreams. That’s why I love James Baldwin. Actually, Pve been on a James
Baldwin diet, reading a lot of him. I’ve just finished the book Just Above My
Head. All his work is so much about love, loving humanity, loving your
neighbor, and really seeing your family members holistically and still finding a
place to love them, finding a way to love them. I think everything is about love,
and I think ideally I would like to write a big chunky book about love that one of
my cousins could read and say “Oh my God, there’s something for me to strive
for” not just be like Puff Daddy.

 

So you hope that your work could have a transformative effect?

Definitely. That’s my dream. I think that the only way that can happen is for me
to allow myself to be transformed and to sort of let go of some of the boundaries
that existed in me.

What about the comment one hears occasionally from people that the notion that
you can change the world for the better stems from the conviction that you
possess some kind of privileged knowledge or privileged vision that others lack
and that somehow you can bring the light, that you can awaken other people?

I actually don’t feel that way. I feel that when we start seeing that everyone has
power, that’s what brings about change. As soon as I sit down with you, and I just
believe in you, something is bound to happen. I trust that your ideas are valid and
that you are doing great things. Then, automatically, that energy that ’'m giving
you gets internalized in you as you say, “OK, I do offer something to the world.”
Therefore change happens. It becomes this domino effect of positiveness and
change. Not so much that I have the power to change.
