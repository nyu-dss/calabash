My mother would say that I had it so much easier than she did, but I remember of
my childhood, that I was home a lot and followed very strict rules. I had to take
care of my brother because my mother was a single mom. She divorced my father
when I was around six. So while she was putting herself through college and
trying to work and pay the bills, I was basically responsible for my little brother.
I remember a lot of chores, a lot of chores. But I also found time to play and go
behind my mother’s back and do all the things that young girls do. When my
mother divorced my father, she brought all her family here to New York so I grew
up with a big family.

Did your parents divorce in New York?

Yes, they divorced here when I was six. After the divorce the whole maternal side
of the family came to NY: my grandmother, my grandfather, and my mother’s
five brothers and sisters. We did all the very common things in an immigrant
family, a lot of people in one apartment until my mom’s siblings established
themselves and they went to college. So it was crowded. We lived in Washington
Heights on 165th Street and Broadway.

I recall that area as a rather notorious spot, a place which, at least in the late 80s
and early 90s, many viewed as a brood of drug activity, a dangerous locality.

Yes, and also it was the border of danger. Eventually, most of my family moved
to 164th St. The novel takes place on 164th because I have a strong love for that
street since I spent so much time growing up there. 164th was really hot. 165th
St. was facing New York Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital served as kind of

protection from that one street, and we occupied the border of what was “good”
and “bad”.

Has the geography changed a lot since then? I know a lot of construction has
taken place there in that part of the city.

Actually right now, right across the street from the building where I grew up, they
are building a hotel for the hospital’s patients, which is going to change the
neighborhood dramatically. Before, there was a parking lot there.

But things stand more or less as you remember them in terms of the streets and
the architectural structures?

Everything is exactly the same except for the Audubon building, the site where
Malcolm X was killed, right across from the building I grew up in, which is now
remodeled and is owned by Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Back in the
day it was burnt down.

How important was education for your mom?
