It was extremely important. It’s interesting for me to see how our family
compared to other families that we grew up around. My brother and I both went
to college. I then pursued graduate studies and so did my brother. My mother
went to college and her two brothers whom she brought to this country both
obtained masters.

So they mastered the English language and crossed cultural barriers?

They mastered the English language, and they went for graduate degrees and are
professionals. One of my uncles went to SUNY Stony Brook and then he went to
UCLA to study Spanish literature. Then he went back to Stony Brook to get his
graduate degree in business administration and now he is earning another
Master’s degree in education. My other uncle did Computer Science at City
College and math education. He is now a teacher.

What did your mom do?

My mother studied accounting, and she’s still trying to finish college. Her trying
to get us all through college has hindered her own effort to finish college. But I
think she is going to finish soon. We are hoping; we are crossing our fingers. It’s
been slow.

Where did you go to school?

I went to catholic school through the 8” grade. Then I attended one of the city’s
specialized high schools. LaGuardia School of the Arts and was an art major.
Then I went to FIT- Fashion Institute of Technology. Initially I stayed in New
York City to study fashion design. It took me about 4 years to finish a two-year
degree because I was working full-time. [ve had to work since the age of 13.
Going to school and working have always gone hand in hand for me. Soon I
began craving my independence because I had to share my room with my brother,
and I couldn’t stand it anymore. He was 17 and I was 18, and I was doing quite
well financially. I was managing a store on Madison Avenue selling cashmere.
So I told my mom “I’m ready to move out,” and I did. That’s why it took me so
long to finish this 2-year degree in fashion design. Then I began to feel so
unhappy because I was trapped in this world of material survival: “I have to pay
the rent, I have to work.” I really didn’t know what I wanted. All I knew was that
this place where we’re supposed to arrive yielded no satisfaction. Finally, I had
my own space. I was living in the Upper East Side, on 83rd street and Lexington
and at this place I felt, “Oh my God, where have I arrived”? Completely unhappy,
I was also totally overworked. What changed my whole life was my discovery of
writing.

Did your mother present any objection to your moving out?
