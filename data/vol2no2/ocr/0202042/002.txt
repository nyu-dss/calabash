PANCHO VILLA’S DAUGHTER

Pancho Villa’s daughter
fresh from a continent
where blood dries quickly on the plains

young as a suckling spruce
old as Mayans

scatters Euros now
stacks them neatly in numerical order

behind a glass window
through eyes as grey as the rain.

You’d never know it,
behind that glass partition
with its beech trim
and bronzed name- plate

sits a daughter of the plains
trading dollars for escudos

efficiently advising on Tessas, ISAs
blue chip files and overseas investments.

The South London accent
wavers on a trade- wind

ushered briskly through the swing doors,
as dry as the yucca straining

for a square of blue.
But, don’t talk to her of open spaces

of savannahs rippling
like land eels in the heat;

don’t talk to her of
vaqueros voiceless as vagrants

with 1969 on a movie screen.
Her face will shut as swiftly

as a time-lock,

will look past you
as cold as morning rain.
