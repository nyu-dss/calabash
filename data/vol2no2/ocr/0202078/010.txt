sea moan down the hill; after a lifetime of its company, it’s like the sound of his own
breathing. And as he has done on so many nights for their lifetime together, now he absorbs
the rhythm of his wife’s breathing, even this low, labored cadence — and that too, he does not

hear.

In this quiet, for the fist time since he has know this woman who has brought him so much, he

feels that he has given her a real gift. Almost forty years ago, he had brought her a cheap
scent, essence of lavender, that he’d awkwardly chosen to try to win her attention; at the time,
he’d thought that the feeling of inadequacy had come because he had wanted to buy something
more expensive, something grander. But through the years, as they grew together, as his
pockets deepened and his options increased, the feeling returned. Fancy linen handkerchiefs,

English tea biscuits, gold bangles and chains, and real French perfume. But still the feeling —
over and over again until, he recognized his true belief that she had given him more than he

could ever match.

And now, though it is not the case that he feels a balance of the scales, he watches her drift

gently into sleep and feels that he has given her something small and meaningful. And it will
be this moment, this gift, that he will clutch to his heart when he drifts into his own final sleep

that will take him to meet her once more, just months after she had leaves him sitting on a

wooden chair, in a gentle breeze, in their house on the hill.
