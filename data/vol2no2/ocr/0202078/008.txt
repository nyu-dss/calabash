Down in the shed, the Old Man started his

mission by
lighting the
coal pot. The
coals — would

himself in

the rough
white and
brown flesh,
first into a
coarse,
speckled

meal, then a
soft mush, and
finally into a

the pumpkin,

the tangled mesh of seeds, and put a wedge of

it into the coal pot’s “oven”. Then he moved

Marjory’s Meal
Ingredients
2 blue crabs
2 cups of coconut milk
1 cup of pumpkin, roasted & crushed
2 pumpkin blossoms
I lime
several lime ‘buds’
dried peel of I orange
spice sticks (cinnamon)
pinch of salt
2 teaspoons of brown sugar

Coconut milk

Husk and break open dried coconut with cutlass or machete; drain
liquid and reserve to drink later; remove coconut meat from shell;
grate coconut meat to a fine pulp over bowl; add enough water to
make pulp moist but not runny; in a clean, cotton cloth, twisted into a
closed bulb, squeeze moist pulp in batches over a bowl until it yields
no more milk.

Roasted pumpkin
Place a large wedge of ripe pumpkin, skin side down, in the white
coals of a coal pot; roast until flesh of pumpkin is tender to a fork
(about ¥2 hour); remove from coals and let cool to touch; scoop flesh
from pumpkin skin and place in mortar; grind with pestle to a coarse
puree.

Orange Peel tea

Bring two cups of water to a rapid boil, add about four or five inches
of dried orange peel to water and let steep for at least five minutes;
remove peel and serve in teacups sweetened with one teaspoon of
brown sugar per cup.

Pumpkin blossoms stuffed with crabmeat

Clean crabs thoroughly - remove backs and any sand or mud, rinse
under running water and rub liberally with lime.

Place coconut milk in cast iron pot on a rack over the coal pot.

Add lime buds, a spice stick and remaining orange peel and bring to
a gentle boil.

Add crabs and simmer until cooked, about 15 minutes.

Remove crabs from pot and let cool to touch.

Crack crab and remove crabmeat from shell.

Combine crabmeat with pumpkin; season lightly with salt, adding just
enough of reserved coconut boiling liquid to achieve a creamy
texture.

Gently stuff mixture into pumpkin blossoms with a spoon, leaving
enough room to twist flower closed.

Place stuffed pumpkin blossoms on coconut shells and roast briefly
over coals, about 5 minutes.

Arrange stuffed blossoms on plates and decorate with lime buds and
spice sticks.

Serve with orange peel tea.
