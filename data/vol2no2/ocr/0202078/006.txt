perform well. And maybe they had all learned this lesson because of his painterly tales
about working in the coconut groves as a boy, and in the oil field in hs youth or building
the business as man. Tales he told again and again. Or maybe even because of the “cut
tails’ they use to get if they shirked their chores when they were growing up; or because
with each day, the Old Man showed it by example in the work he did himself. But maybe

Marjory had been the Old Man’s life. The world might never have known it. The church

school uniform every night to make sure the crease lasted all day long. And Glen had
seen her crochet the tablecloth that they still used on Easter and Christmas, and the
antimacassars for the chair arms, and even the cloth that was used on the alter when the

Bishop visited their church.

On Friday, while he could still hear the gravel crunch under the jeep’s tires as the boys
left for the day, he got dressed; and he walked down the hill as the first light sparkled off

the moist crystals on the grass. As usual, he was glad for the early morning stillness: a
quiet that could only be had before the soft lap of the low tide waves was broken by the
cock’s crow. This same soft light and gentle sound had allowed him, a little boy, to
