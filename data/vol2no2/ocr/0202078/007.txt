dream big dreams; a young man to plot grand schemes; a man to plan his moves before a
day’s challenges; and now an old man to remember, and to think simple, peaceful
thoughts. This last week, there had been no big dreams or wild schemes, only a rising
tide of memory as he moved with purpose and strength, powered by the pull of some

distant moon.

Again he sat down with an orange and the wood-handled knife. For five days now he Ind

been working on this, working for the fist time not on what he wanted, not toward a
chosen destination; but simply accepting what seemed like the only choice that life was
now allowing. For a lifetime he had created his own paths, slashing through thickets of

what often seemed like this island’s indigenous barriers — poverty, classism, jealousy,

corruption — and still made his own way. And with that same drive, for the past months

he had fought against accepting any of this. ought and slashed, planned and imagined,
all up until this last week. But, this week had somehow brought an acceptance of
Marjory’s condition. After his initial denial, then growing anger, and even powerless
frustration, finally, he was swimming with the rip tide instead of fighting against it. And
now he sat with the juice of this orange running down his chin; juice suddenly matched

by salty tears flowing from some deep well of loss, pushed to the calm surface of what
had been his pool of strength. The tears came drop by drop, velling until they flowed,

and flowing more and more until they bloomed into sound — one low, deep sob and then

another and another, until his body was shaking. And then he had to set the knife down
as he crumbled from his middle, folding at the gut and catching his head in his hands.
There, with the breeze still gently stirring the leaves, with the birds still singing sweetly

and the waves still lapping on the shore, he cried alone.
