Osterizer had taken its place; some wooden spoons and a beat-up wood-handled knife
from the back of one of the drawers; and finally, the stone mortar and pestle from on top
of the cupboard. The Old man hadn’t climbed up this high in a long time. No one used
this old fashioned grinding tool anymore, but it sat atop the cupboard like a simple
sculpture on display; it was the one thing that might be missed.

At 11 o’clock he sat on a stool in the back of the shed, facing the woods with an orange
and the wood-handled knife in his lap. He could just barely hear the waves lapping on
shore, singing a harmony to the melody of the rustling leaves, broken by the rhythm of a
loud bird asking over and over “qu'est que il dit, keskidee”. Mindlessly he worked at the
orange, slipping the sharp blade between the rind and the fleshy white pith, not noticing

swirling in his heart. He hung the orange rind on a nail head to dry, the first ingredient of

the meal.

He hadn’t started this, planning to cook a meal. Marjory, had no appetite; and when she
did eat, it was hard for her to keep anything down. So by the time he had formed this
idea, and the plan was hatching in the fore of his mind, he still was unsure of what this
meal would be. But once decided, the only thing that was unquestionable was that there

would be blue crab. Some way, it had to have some blue crab in there.
The first frugal meal Marjory had cooked for them, the day after they had gotten married,

was blue crab, curried crab. They had been awkward around each other, and the

marriage dance that they would eventually master over all their years, was still a
