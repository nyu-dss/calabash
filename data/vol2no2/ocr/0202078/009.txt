told Gloria to go into town, the finality of the statement didn’t leave room for her to question,
or protest that she had to stay and take care of her mother. “Take the car and go to Point and
get some stamps and envelopes,” he said. But he touched her arm before she walked out the

door and = said, “don’t worry, I can take care of your Mother.”

The Old Man stands with the tray at the bedroom doorway watching Marjory propped up on
the pillows; tentative suddenly, he remembers the postures of their children bringing their first

report card homes; he sees Gloria standing before him, with a Father’s day card made in school
and Glen with a “mad bull” kite that he wanted help to fly. Marjory turns ever so slightly, a

work is moist, sweet, and delicate. “Here Marge, drink some orange peel tea,” he says next.
Wordless, accompanied by the sounds of the breeze though the trees, they continue these steps:

a small fork for her, a fork for him, a sip of tea. As they make their way past the halfway

mark, she looks at him and says, “Crab, eh?’ “Boy, you remember to put crab in here too,”

with a trace of the sparkle that has kept him happy for so many years.
