By Wednesday he started gathering more ingredients. He would need a good pumpkin —
nothing big, but one sweet and full of perfume. He didn’t have to worry much about
picking the right one because the pumpkin vine in the back of the main house was always
bearing and it never had a bad gourd on it. While he was back there, he was drawn to the
pumpkin blossoms like a bee seeking pollen. So when he returned to the shed, his haul

was not just a ripe, fragrant pumpkin that he’d set out to get, but also some delicate

pumpkin flowers that he couldn’t seem to leave behind; and he had added to this harvest

eat’; and they talked about him — “George, how you think the Old Man making out with
this thing?’ But each one of the children was busy with the jobs they had found for
themselves or the others had assigned them. Gloria was the chief nurse and ever at their
mother’s side. Gregory focused on the business, keeping all the daily problems to

himself and sparing the others petty worry. George organized doctors’ visits, and
medicine deliveries and made arrangements with the priests and church elders. Glen, still
in school at Presentation, had been ordered to keep his mind on his upcoming exams.
The one thing that the Old Man had preached and preached over the years, one thing that
they had all learned, was that regardless of the undertaking, you were supposed to
