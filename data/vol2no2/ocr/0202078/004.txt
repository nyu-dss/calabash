tentative two-step, with neither of them quite sure where the hands went or how to shift

on a downbeat. So he had gone out that day, as much to settle his soul, and to ground

himself in the natural world of the coast and the mangrove, as to bring back some

specific item. Nonetheless, he ended up coming back home with half a dozen blue crabs

that he had caught. And later, Marjory cleaned them, seasoned them and curried them

down — a dry, smoky curry made over the coal pot.

They ate quietly, in the simple shack that would be theirs until years later when he built
the house up the hill; the kerosene lamp sitting on the bare, wooden table between them,
cast their silhouettes in two grand, flickering shadows on the walls. The crab was good,
and they cracked into the shells and sucked out the sweet meat, licking the brown-yellow

sauce off their fingers. And right after that meal of curried crab, they were together for

the first time as aman and woman. Yes, they had spent the previous night in the same

bed, but unlike an American movie, or an English romance novel, that honeymoon night

had been strange and shy and their marriage bond had remained unconsummated.

So, it was on the second night, that they had flowed with the currents that pulled them

toward each other. And on that second night, with all the manly strength that he felt, the

power that he had used with abandon on a handful of other women before they were

married, he had taken his place as her husband over her. And on the same night she had
first shown her simple, earthy majesty over him. Yes, lying under him, she held on to the
smooth, taught skin at his hipbones as he felt all of his hardness inside her. And it was
like this, almost always like this, that she would guide him as they were joined in a love

act. She would hold on and he would be moved — grinding, riding — to her unspoken

direction; she would touch him there and push back when she was ready, raise up to meet
his thrust, then pull him back down slowly and wind in surging, assured, circles;

eventually she would grab the back of his neck, drawing his face to her hot bosom,

raising their passion to a climax. Anyone watching might have seen only the strong,
sweating husband and believed that he was in control, like watching a boat on the water

with no awareness of the rudder underneath pushing the tide to make the hull turn this

way or that.
