‘,.. [he night-time put on flesh and blackness ...’

Zora Neale Hurston,

Their eyes were watching God

... Wearing two-tone shoes and new cotton

he filters an aroma singed with incense and
cardamoms

through Demerara shutters

sealed tight against his breath.

Inside, the young widow fastens locks
checks under the bed

pats four small heads
kisses the cold cross round her neck.

He’s on the front-steps, tapping

a soft- shoe shuffle into perfumed oleander

and a Lighthouse cigarette. With a step- and
change

the guard- dog’s breath snuffs into a blue moon.
