COLIN ROBINSON straddles a national and cultural identity with the Caribbean
and Trinidad, where he spent his childhood and adolescence — and another with the
political and expressive communities he has helped build as a “Black, Gay man” or a
“queer man of color” in New York City, where he has spent his entire adult life. His
creative work is similarly fragmented; he managed production and served as
administrator for Other Countries: Black Gay Voices, collaborated with choreographer
Ronald K. Brown on Lessons and filmmaker Marlon Riggs on Tongues Untied and
Anthem. His poems and essays have appeared primarily in LBGT and independent
literary and political journals and anthologies since 1985.
