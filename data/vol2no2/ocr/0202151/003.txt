pushes her cell
into the other—

23" Street,

the doors open—
“dee end is cawmin’...

.. Armagedd’n...”
the words ricochet

off white tiled walls—
crocodile doors clamp;

she’s getting closer,
shuffling up the aislk—
“Who mad dee sun
cawm up
dis marnin’’?”
A lanky teen gnaws his thumb
then snaps:

“The sun came up
by itself.”
