Ever since she kissed him with her lollipop-stained tongue, the pain in his heart
has swelled. Last night he dreamt that a turtle rose out the ocean and crept on his bed.
On its shell were written, "Remember" in blood. He sprang awake, mouth dry and called
his sister.

At the wedding she choked on the cake.
He died the night of their honeymoon, as they were about to make love.
At his funeral, she tripped over his mother and broke her leg. Her cat ran away.
She couldn't stay awake.
Next time she will not wear cerulean.

She wanted to bite him. Hard. Until he bled. Then she would watch him writhe.
This was not love.
Or was it? As confusing as a sun-filled day that ends in a storm. The world gone
gray, dark, left alone with only the green wind as a sympathetic ear.

She woke with the sun- flowers in bloom at her window, but knew she was still in
the dream as the car slid off the road and plunged into the precipice.

She knew how she got there, in this room, when the baby sucking at her breasts
bit her nipples.

They had always wanted a child that was the perfect manifestation of their love so
when the baby was born that Thursday evening, at home, in the bath-tub, two months

early, without the aid of midwife, they forgot the world outside their front door and drew
the blinds tight.
