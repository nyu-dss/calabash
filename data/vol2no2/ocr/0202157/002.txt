A FAMILY BUILT ON LOVE
Mother

She was a mountain, but once she disappeared for six months like the wind on a parched
day. I itemized all my transgressions. If she were to return and forgive me, I would be ruthlessly
devoted, she would never have to question my love or beg for my obedience.

Father
He could turn off his love like a faucet. For most of my life I doubted it, wanted some

confirmation. It was not enough that he said it. It was not enough that he sent me cards on my
birthday. I wanted to see it pour from his eyes.

Sister
I pretended she was my twin, loved when we wore identical clothes, when our mother

braided our hair the same way, but we were not alike. I was talkative and fearless, longing for
the horizon beyond your yard while she had no desire to venture beyond our front gate.

Brother
I fell in love with him that Thursday afternoon when I laid crying on my bed because I

couldn't figure out my geometry problem. He wiped my tears then showed me how to calculate
the answers. At his soccer game, when the crowd chanted his name, my stomach flip-flopped.

Uncle
I watched with amazement as he effortlessly chopped up the vegetables with speed.

Later, when he set up his easel and replicated the house on the hill with detailed exactness I
knew his fingers and eyes held a universe of truth. He was a chef with an artist's heart.

Aunt
She chuckled a lot, it appeared as a living sound cradled between her neck and bosom.

She would cook each of us whatever we wanted, and served us with loving indulgence. We
could count on her to turn a blind eye on our antics, as she sat, eyes distant.

Grandmother
No one speaks your name. There is no picture of you. Your oldest claims she doesn't

remember what you look like. The youngest says, people tell her she's the spitting image of you,
the middle child asserts her love for you, and I, your name-sake, carry on your spirit.
