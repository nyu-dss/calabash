Grandfather
Tall and lean as a coconut-tree, you strode to our gate, wearing a felt hat flat on your
head, cotton shirt and woolen slacks in the fire day. Always your smile warmed me long before I

ran and grabbed hold of your hand that clasped mine as a friend.

Nephew

If the maxim is true: we love those things that remind us of joy, then you are my treasure-
box full of surprises. Each time I open you, I glimpse a past fuzzy with age, but my body is
washed with the feeling of immense pleasure reflected in your smile.

Niece
A gift, but not a present, you sneak into my life, eager to please, wearing the look of

hunger in your mother's eyes --the need for approval-- imposing over your own raw smile so
confident to leap, legs scaling over the wall. I watch you, my heart a trampoline.
