“Listen, Lela, I told you to stop, if you don’t I'll tell Mami about you and
Freddie.”

She makes my stomach hurt and jaw tight. I am tired of her making me fix the bed
and sweep and mop and then telling Mami that she did it. I am tired of her, “If you don’t
do this, Pll tell Mami...”

“Go ahead, I don’t care,” I tell her trying to sound like I mean it. In less than a
second my sister turns around and tells my mother that she saw Freddie and me with our
pants down. “Her panties were down too, Mami.”

My mother does not say a word to me. I hear the squeak of the vinyl covering on
the sofa as my mom gets up. I look at my legs and regret wearing a skirt today. I never
wear skirts, why did I wear a skirt today. I hear the jingling of metal and know that she is
looking inside the closet.

I feel the belt against my back first. I leap up and try to hold the belt from hitting
my face. But my mother is not after my face. She is after my legs. No, she is after what’s
between my legs. The inside of my thighs hurt. Sucia, fresca. Esta fresceria en esta casa
no se acepta. 1am on my back and I use my feet to keep her from hitting my face. I know
she is not after my face, but that is where I am scared she will hit me most. Mami never
hits any of us in the face. If she hits us in the face we will lose our shame, that is what she
always tells us.

“Mami, please, stop, stop hitting her.” I hear my sister’s voice crying to my
mother and I hope that she gets hit too. Usually she laughs when Mami hits me. Usually I
laugh when Mami hits her. But now she is holding Mami’s hand and crying. Mami

pushes her off. She won’t stop until she’s beaten the sickness out of me.
