MY SISTER

My sister has her feet against mine. Her toes are fat and long. Her legs are
stronger than mine because she is six years older than me. We are playing footsie on the
loveseat while my mother soaks her feet in hot water and watches her favorite TV novela,
“Raquel.” Raquel is a sexy woman who during the day is a saint and at night climbs out
her window and then goes topless dancing in a bar. We are usually not up so late on a
Wednesday, but tomorrow there is no school.

My sister pushes her feet against me so hard that my knees almost bang against
my head.

“Okay, now stop,” she tells me, “I don’t want to play anymore.”

I don’t listen to her and push my feet against her.

“Lela, I told you to stop!”

I am having fun not listening to her and I push her so hard that she almost falls off
the couch.

She stands up from the couch and leans over my face. Her eyes are so big. Her
glasses are so thick. Thick like the magnifying glass my science teacher has. My sister is

very ugly. There is yellow stuff around her teeth because she does not like to brush them.
