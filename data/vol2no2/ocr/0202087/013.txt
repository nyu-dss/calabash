D.J.: Well, Iam not one who believes that all art is made to be sold, although I very
much want to sell my work. My paintings and photographs have been sold, but of course
the video piece, “The Blowing season”, has not been sold. I am working on the DVD
version! (LAUGHTER) The video piece is something that has to almost only live in a
gallery setting and there are some places that can buy a projection piece like the one I
have made, put it on, and I would just LOVE to see this piece exhibited in a really big
way. In St. Martin they have not been able to put on this piece that calls for a minimum
of three video projectors. My dream is still to put it on there some day. Still, it is
important for me to make work like that, for I believe that sometimes it is vital to a work
that it be solely expressive, that it is solely about getting your message across, and not to
worry about whether it will sell or not. I guess what I oftentimes strive for in my work is
to have an ephemeral yet political quality to my work that extends beyond the purely

aesthetic.
