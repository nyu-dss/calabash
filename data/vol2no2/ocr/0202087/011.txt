There were moments when the pond would stink ... God oh it would reek ... the entire
place ... and I would think that the pond is rebelling. In the summer of 2002 I had an
exhibit at the Bearden Gallery in St. Martin where I actually applied salt to the canvas,
and then painted in grids --- these works were called the “A/Salting Series” --- and these
grid-like structures have a direct connection to the salt pond that was also gridded, aerial
photographs show that the pond is divided up into squares and rectangles. I use similar
divisions as a way to divide up the canvas and then had areas of the canvas that were just
chunks of salt. After the show I was part of a radio interview where the discussion
veered off into this idea of why didn’t we reclaim this pond? This pond then became a
metaphor for our culture --- it is hidden, but not hidden; it is dirty; it is depressed, but
underneath all this muck there is really this “pure-white” sand in a sense. And I was so
glad the discussion went there, because that was what I was trying to get at, that was what
it was all about for me. People started calling in wanting to know, “well, why is the pond
dirty like this?” “Can we start fixing the pond up and cleaning it up?” This, of course, is
why I really love art, and why I believe in the power of art as a tool for social
contribution. St. Martin was called “Souligia” at one point, which was the old Carib
name for the island, and this meant island of salt. So salt was really strong for even the

indigenous people.

J.B.: | What is your latest project?

D.J.: My latest project is called “Here nor There” and is my first portraiture series and
my first truly purely photographic work in the sense that the images come from a camera
and I print them out. It is based on cultural theorist, Hommi Bhabba’s, idea of the “third
space”. Iinterpret this space as having to do with the “home-ground”, which I am
outside of now, and the Diaspora, where I am now living, and the constant negotiation
between the two. When I go back to St. Martin I always ask myself, “how do things shift
there”; and when I come back to the States I ask, “How do things shift here?” And there
are people who do not have to make this negotiation, who never have to make any kind of
“cultural shifts”, especially when they stay inside “safe zones.” So there are images of me

in Buffalo, private spaces of my home and the area where I live, and of some of the
