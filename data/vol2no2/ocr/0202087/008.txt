the contemporary art market worked. My question always of myself, and my art on the

island was: Would this be good somewhere else?

J.B.: And so you left and you went to...

D.J.: I went to Rochester at the Visual Studies Workshop there, which was mainly
photography and video. I ended up leaving Rochester after a year because there were no
individual studios at the school, which I really needed. Buffalo was right next door and
when I visited the University of Buffalo I found out that as an MFA student I could get a
studio, and so I applied, got in and transferred to Buffalo. At Buffalo I did my best work.
Buffalo has a thriving art scene. There are lots of alternative art spaces that have
international recognition, which are willing to give regional artists --- artists based in
Buffalo & Western New York state --- a chance to show, which is rare. Also because
real estate is so cheap and given the post-industrial state of Buffalo, people get together
and open art spaces and show work and have performances. With this dynamic art scene
combined with the feedback I was getting from the faculty, my work really thrived.
Where as before I was mostly concerned about the material and working with certain
paints, these exercises in form and color, I started to infuse my work with a lot of content:
personal, cultural, critical, political. I really began to explore what it is that I was trying
to say and what was relevant to me. I started to go more into video, incorporated my own
sound instead of using somebody else’s sound, and I moved into photography. In St.
Martin I mainly painted and am known on the island as a painter while in Buffalo I am

known as a video/photographer.

J.B.: Do you have themes in your work that you work around? Groups of work?

D.J.: Most of my work has to do with cultural memory and cultural space. I have
extended into my personal history. In one series “Foremothers” I use images of my
grandmother, my dad’s mom, who I never knew, using her as an iconic figure to form a
personal/familial history that is lost. I am all about constructing these mythologies of my

own. St. Martin is not like the other Caribbean islands like Haiti or Jamaica where
