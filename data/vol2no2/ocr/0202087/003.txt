had ajob. So, our family has moved around a bit. As for myself, I celebrated my first

birthday in St. Martin and I grew up in St. Martin.

As a young adult I then came to the States, to Marist College, for my bachelor’s degree in
communications, which I got in 1993. During my last year of Marist College I took some
art classes: photography and painting. I had made art before, but it was basically for
myself, flowers and that kind of thing, but I wanted to take it further. I still remember to
this day the first day of painting class, standing in front of the door and being afraid to go
in. I was concerned about everything, wondering if I would be able to “get it right” in
this introductory painting class. I stood outside, fretting, incredibly uptight about going
into this class, until I had this idea that I was going to go in and learn stuff, yes, but
knowing that I was going to paint what I wanted to paint. What I wanted was for
somebody to help me to do what I wanted to do well. I lucked out and I got an instructor,
who, to this day I still e-mail and keep abreast of what I am doing, all my shows, because
he gave me the leeway to do what I wanted to do: when we had these color studies of
gray, I swore I heard him say that you could put in red and umber! And by the time it
was done and all the paintings were up, everybody’s painting was black and white and
gray and there was mine: orange! I remember being distraught because I thought I hadn’t
been paying attention! Then, when I looked at the other students work the thought
occurred to me: Good God, nobody else took this opportunity to use some color? He
explained to the class that the reason I am not giving Deborah an “F” is because
sometimes people come from a background or culture and they have just a different color
scheme. She tried to make this gray, (because the big kettle was gray), but everything
else was red. Deborah needed me to hear me tell her to put in red! And he was that way
with me throughout. I came to love it so much, painting, that that I would always be in

the studio painting.

J.B.: So what you are saying to me is that art was like a hobby and that’s why you got

your degree in communications?
