UNEARTHING MEMORIES:
A CONVERSATION WITH ST. MARTIN ARTIST

DEBORAH JACK

J.B.: Tell me your process of becoming an artist? Why for example did you feel it

necessary to get an MFA?

D.J.: Around 1998 I started thinking that it was time for me to go back to school to

mom, to further her education as a nurse, had to go to Holland to do this and my dad went

island there is a generation of people like me who were born in Holland, just like we have

many people, like my parents, who were born in the oil refineries of Aruba where people

went to work. My dad’s parents came from St. Vincent and Barbados, my mom’s from

St. Martin, but both my parents were born in Aruba and grew up there. My dad came
with my mom back to St. Martin because she had her family in St. Martin and she also
