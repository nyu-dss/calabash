D.J.: Well, no, I was always interested in art as a social instrument, especially in
filmmaking, but in those days the St. Martin government would not give you a
scholarship to go study “art.” So even though I wanted to do film and I wanted to do art I
knew I would never get a scholarship to do that. So I took the courses closest to what I
wanted to do: television courses, video production, journalism and writing. There was

still this idea that you needed to have “practical skills” to get a job.

J.B.: How did you end up though in the States going to school, as opposed to say
Holland?

D.J.: Well, the truth of the matter is that St. Martin has a better cultural relationship with
the United States than we do with Holland. Holland is our official colonial power, but in
terms of culture and the Caribbean region, America is much closer. I had been coming to
America every year since I was six years old on vacation. So I had more of an affinity
with America than Holland. Why you do not find more people from St. Martin studying
in the States is that the government of St. Martin can send five people to study in Holland
on what it costs for one person to study in the United States. So, if you are going for a
government scholarship it is a little more difficult to get one for America. I did end up
getting a government scholarship in my second year of study --- my parents paid for the
first year. Because of what I was studying in terms of communications & television

production, people felt it was more feasible to study this in America.

J.B.: What did you end up doing after you got your degree in the States?

D.J.: After I graduated from Marist College I went back to St. Martin working for a
private production company that ended up going under since there is really no market for
this in St. Martin. Clients did not understand that even a thirty-second ad needed two-
three days to shoot and a required production budget that many people were not willing
to pay. So the company went under. After that I went to work for the government in the
information department for the next six years doing a bit of everything, but mainly I

ended up revitalizing the internal newsletter, being the editor and writer for that, creating
