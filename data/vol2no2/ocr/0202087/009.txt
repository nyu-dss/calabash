people know their folklore and traditional stories, this is not as widespread in St. Martin.
My counter to this absence is to create these mythologies/this mythology that has been
lost. Some would say that, well, “you are making this up”, to which my reply is that most
of history is a construct anyway. History is a story. If this story is in the back of my
mind I take the prerogative to say that this is a cultural/ ancestral memory. Toni
Morrison’s idea of the “remomory” that is triggered for a reason, usually when there is
danger, is an idea that I subscribe to. And I think the danger is that here we have an
island that is trying to form an identity but it doesn’t have much to look back to because
of St. Martin’s “particular” colonial position and this is a dangerous position to be in. So

I have these memories and I construct my world out of this.

J.B.:_ What do you mean by St. Martin’s “particular” colonial position?

D.J.: St. Martin is still a Dutch colony. We have a certain autonomy by being in the
Netherlands Antilles, but a colony is a colony is a colony --- that’s just what you are.
What makes St. Martin even more unique is that we share a part of this tiny island --- 36
square miles --- with the French, so one side of the island is a French “department”. This
is the colonial framework that we work in. Of course the people, ourselves, we operate
as one and we are really moving away from talking about the “French side” and the
“Dutch side” of the island, but these divisions are still there. It is all so ludicrous: there
are borders on this 36 square miles island saying, “Welcome to the French side —
Welcome to the Dutch side”. At one time the Spanish controlled the island, but when the
Dutch and the French settled on the island they signed the Treaty of Concordia, which
divided the island into two parts. The divisions are uneven: the Dutch side is smaller
than the French side. The people on the French side, their education is in French, while
for the people on the Dutch side, up until recently, it was in Dutch and Dutch/

English. When you go over on the French side the signs, post office, schools etc. are all
in French and on our side they are all in Dutch/English, but mostly English which is our

“mother tongue”.
