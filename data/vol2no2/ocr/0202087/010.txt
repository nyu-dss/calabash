And, in the center of the island sits “the Great Salt Pond” which is a geographic symbol
that recurs often in my work. In “Foremothers”, for example, I work with photographic
images of my paternal grandmother, the one who I did not know. These photographic
images are placed in shadow boxes covered by salt and text --- note the use of salt in my
work. My second set of work is called “Blowing Season” which is six projection videos
of: (1) Three separate reverse black and white projected images that all have to do with
“salt”/corrosion and; (2) three vivid color images that had to do with renewal. This work
is basically a video, in an environment with 8’x10’ projections. “Blowing Season” dealt
with hurricanes, saltwater from the sea, and the ancestral notion of this as a seasonal
event. For me hurricanes are a kind of seasonal remembrance, all the souls that were lost
in the middle passage coming back for a reckoning every season, because there have been
no monuments to them on the island, no sort of remembrance for them, a denial of
however many millions perished. This idea came out of looking at one of those satellite
maps of a hurricane and seeing how it travels from Africa and across the Atlantic to the
Caribbean and seeing how it goes to America, just like slaveships, I thought, so I wanted
to infuse all of this on the hurricane. But more than that, this piece had to do, for me,
with memory and the unearthing of memories --- always, for me, it is about the
unearthing of memories --- this eating away, and that is why I like salt because salt is
corrosive, it will rust, and it will strip layers away, and you will get to what’s underneath
something, and sometimes it is not always pretty. So, for me, salt is a strong metaphor to

use.

So St. Martin has this “Great Salt Pond” where slaves were brought to work. This pond
has since become a landfill for garbage in the middle of the island, something that is a
source of much embarrassment, sewage is dumped there, that kind of thing. I am very
taken with the idea that this pond was our colonial currency and why we were colonized,
salt for gold. Salt as money. This idea of the dirtying/the sullying of the pond can be
linked to the suppression/oppression of memory. The idea that there was slavery on the
island is not something that is really openly discussed on the island, yet, that’s how most
of us got there! But nobody wants to talk about this --- why go dig up these things is the

feeling. This is why I use salt as a strategic metaphor. Salt strips through all these ideas.
