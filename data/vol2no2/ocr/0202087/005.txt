a framework for the corporate newsletter. Then I worked on policy planning, developing
a five-year policy action plan that was adopted by the director, moving up to acting head

of the department.

J.B.: But you were also doing other things while you were in St. Martin, art related

things...

D.J.: Yes, I was co-owner of an art café/alternative art space called AXUM., which was
like an art café but we organized the first “open mic” on the island and out of that grew a
monthly forum where people came and discussed social issues/political issues, also a
vibrant jazz scene. All these musicians who had only played “touristy” stuff where now
given a venue where they could play whatever they wanted, which, of course led to a lot
of fusion work, musicians were free to create whatever they wanted without sticking to
the tourist idea of what Caribbean music is all about. It was really a vibrant scene, art

openings as well.

J.B.: Tell mea little bit about what the art scene is like in St. Martin ... the artists there
... the galleries, that kind of thing.

D.J.: The art scene in St. Martin is growing. There are a lot of artists, more than I
realized until I started to pay attention. We also have a large “expat” community,
American and European artists, who come to the island to live and work. Also, there are
local artists who have shows and show work and sell work as well. But the bent is
“traditional”, “representational”, “Modern”, that is the kind of work that you tend to see.
We have the elder artists who I think deserve respect for what they have been able to
achieve, people like Mr. Cynric Griffiths and Roland Richardson. Ruby Bute is sort of
the grand dame of the arts, and in addition to being an artist she is also a poet and
sometimes performs readings with a band. For me, this group constitutes an “old
school” in a way. Then we have Mosera who has his art gallery, and, actually, I worked
as Media relations coordinator at the Mosera Fine Arts Gallery for a while. We opened up

the only contemporary art gallery that was specifically dedicated to contemporary work.
