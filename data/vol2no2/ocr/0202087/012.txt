surroundings, none of this ever overtly --- no, I don’t put in City Hall in Buffalo --- I

shoot them in fragmented ways because this is kind of a fragmented experience.

J.B.: What I find so interesting is your use of that word “Diaspora”. What does that

word mean to you?

D.J.: The concept of Diaspora has been used in many ways. There are numerous
Diasporas. However, for my work, the word Diaspora is very specific to St. Martin and
the people from St. Martin and the notion of a St. Martin Diaspora. So there is a St.
Martin Diaspora in the Caribbean, America, and Holland. But this connection to Holland
is a misguided one in a sense, because I believe that people on the island look to the
United States, because the U.S. is so close. The cultural penetration is mostly from the
Caribbean and the U.S. Well ... thinking about it, I think the word Diaspora has really to
do with St. Martin and the larger Caribbean culture here in the United States and the large

community in the Netherlands.

J.B.: Not to the “Black” community in the United States?

D.J.: No, Ido not want to connect the word Diaspora to either color or race. I think this
is a mistake, especially from the Caribbean point of view where you have people coming
from East India, from China, from Indonesia. I think that what Black Americans and I
share, what we have in common, is the shared experience and history of slavery, but this
is only one aspect of a connection. For me “Diaspora” means me not living in St. Martin,
but living outside of St. Martin, Deborah abroad. Right now I happen to be living in
America, but I could easy well be living in Holland. Perhaps I feel that the Diaspora is
me and wherever Iam. Diaspora is a very individual kind of thing ... it connotes
scattering ... dispersal. It is a cultural phenomenon but an inherently personal experience.

It’s about how you negotiate between spaces.

J.B.: Where do you envision your work ending up?
