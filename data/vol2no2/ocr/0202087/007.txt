J.B.: How would you characterize the work that you do? Are you a photographer, a

painter?

D.J.: I stay away from categories. My compromise is to say that I am a visual artist, but
my installations incorporate music. I write music, write poetry, I have had a collection of
poems, The Rainy Season, published by the House of Nehesi Press, so categories are very
hard for me. I guess I would best describe myself as an artist working through various
media’s. For me its more like I have an idea, I have a concept, there is something I want
to say, and I start thinking what’s the best way to say this. Sometimes I have started
drawing and come to the realization that this series could really develop into a series of
painting. Sometimes, the work begins to metamorphise when I start working with the
materials --- I realize then that this is a kind of sculptural/ installation kind of thing. But
I think if I approach my work with this idea that I am a painter and all I do is paint then a

lot of things fall by the wayside and I am limiting my expression.

J.B.: It seems to me like you were pretty active, doing quite well in St. Martin, so why

the MFA?

D.J.: After I had my solo show in St. Martin I was selling work and had, yes, a fairly
successful career in art, in terms of reception and everything. But it wasn’t enough for
me. I guess I like punishment! (laughter) I am kidding: what I missed was critical feed
back. I wanted to know if my work could fly somewhere other than St. Martin. I did not
want to loll myself into the sense that this is really great what Iam doing. I wanted my
work to be relevant beyond St. Martin and I figured that to get this I had to leave and go
to a school/place where nobody knew me, and I wouldn't tell anyone about my career at

home. I wanted a neutral critical ground with people who knew the art world and how
