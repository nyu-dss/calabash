Mosera’s work is mainly figurative, but also abstracted and he creates these allegories; of
late it has become more overtly political. There are a lot of tourist-based art galleries that
sell prints from artists from all over the region. What is really exciting for me, however,
is that in the last few years we have artists like Joe Dominique who have come to the
forefront. His work is often abstract, very contemporary in that sense, he has a lot of buzz
around him right now. He lives on the island, has lived there for years, and is showing in
the region and internationally. Artists from other Caribbean islands are also coming to
St. Martin and making a change. More and more there is the idea of a community being
built. The last time I was on the island the artists were putting together an organization,
something like a union of artists to get grants for education and training. Now the major
artists are giving classes to high school children as an organized effort, and so, in that

sense the art scene is progressing.

J.B.:_ What are the structures in place to help one become an artist in St. Martin?

D.J.: At first there were no structures in place to help one become an artist on the island.
One just got up and did it. Now you have art classes by Ruby Bute. Some people go
abroad and study graphic design and end up getting into computer art, doing a lot of
digital art. But there are no art schools on the island, no formal art academy and, yes, I
think that this is needed. However I don’t know how well it would be supported. I don’t
know how many people want to study art on a serious/critical level. My problem with
the St. Martin arts scene is that there has never really been any serious art criticism done.
I think in the literary field it is growing, but not with the visual. When serious art
criticism is given to an artist’s work, an island’s work, a region’s work, then suddenly the
work becomes much more credible, as opposed to it being anyone with a brush painting
and calling themselves an artist. When people are looking in from the outside who
understand that dynamic, then they realize that you are serious about what you are doing.
That you are organized, that you are critical, that when you bring someone in and give
them a show it is because you believe that this person is ready to make a valuable
contribution to the arts. There needs to be some notion on the island of curating and a

curatorial practice and, yes, there are levels that people have to attain.
