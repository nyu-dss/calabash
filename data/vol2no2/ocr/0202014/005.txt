The moment she saw what was in my hand she said, “Wait, make me sit down,” even
though she was already sitting on the steps outside the barracks. She got up and slowly walked
into her room, took off her apron, straightened her cap, sat on the bed and smoothed down her
dress, her back straight. I stood in the doorway and read the message. Her youngest son was

on a ship that went down. I remember being struck by the phrase, “‘All hands”.

I never met Larissa’s sons for they were raised by her mother someplace else but she
talked of them constantly, especially the youngest whose name was Zebedee. When the war
came, both Moses and Zebedee like ten thousand other young men, had rushed off to join the

Contingents. So far as I know, Moses was never heard of again, even after the war ended.

I can still see myself reading to Larissa about the loss of Zebedee Breeze. “All hands.

Larissa didn't cry. She sat there staring silently at the pictures which covered the walls to
a significant depth, for the layers represented not just the many years of her own occupancy, but

I went to sit very close beside her on the bed and she put her arm around me and we
sat like that for a long time. I wanted to speak but my mouth felt very dry and I could hardly get
the words out. “He, Zebedee, was a hero,” was all I could think of saying.

Larissa hugged me tightly with both hands then pulled away and resumed staring at the
wall. She did it with such intensity, it was as if she expected all the images to fly together and

coalesce, finally, into one grand design, to signify something meaningful.

“Zebedee Breeze’, I said to myself, over and over, and his name was like a light wind

passing. How could he have drowned?

After a while Larissa got up and washed her face, straightened her clothes, and walked
with me back to the house to resume her duties. My parents must have spoken to her, but she

took no time off. I never saw her cry that day or any other. She never mentioned her sons.

And something comes to me now that would never have occurred to me then: how

when the son of one of my parents’ friends had died, his mother had been treated so tenderly by
