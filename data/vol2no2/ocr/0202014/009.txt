my mouth, clogging my throat. I coughed and sneezed and spun around shaking my hair like a
mad dog, setting the fragments spinning too, joining the dust motes floating in the sunlight
streaming in.

What a mess I was!

Ashamed, I finally summoned up the nerve to look at my handiwork. There were places
that could never be stripped, the layers so old they were forever bonded to the walls, in some
parts I had managed to strip the walls down to reveal the dark ugly stains from centuries of glue
and printers ink and whatever else can stain. The walls were an abstract collage now: no single

recognisable image was left. Without meaning to, I had erased the previous occupants.

I felt sick at my behaviour, as if I had committed a desecration. Larissa’s room. I had
no right.

But the longer I sat in the room the more I realised it was giving off no disturbing
emanations. What I had done had neither added to nor diminished it. The rage had not been the
women’s but mine. In the wider scheme of things, it was a gesture without meaning. The women
like Larissa would always be one step ahead, rooms like this serving only as temporary refuge.
They knew from the history of their mothers and their mothers before them, they would always
move on. To other rooms elsewhere. To raise for a while children not their own who - like their

own — would repay them with indifference or ingratitude — or death.
I thought I was taking possession, but the room had already been condemned.

I got up and leaned out the window and was surprised at how fresh and clean the air
felt. I offered up my face, my hair, my arms to the wind that was lightly blowing and I closed my
eyes so it would wash away the last fragments of paper and cobweb. O Zebedee Breeze! The
name of Larissa’s son had seemed so magical to me as a child I had often whispered it to
myself, and as I whispered it now, it conjured up the long-forgotten image of Larissa and the

Pain Tree.
