After that, whenever I remembered, I would go and look at the tree but I never
detected any new nails. Perhaps if I had been older and wiser I would have interpreted this

differently, but at the time I took it to mean that Larissa felt no more pain.

Once or twice when I was particularly unhappy, I had myself gone to the tree to try and
drive a nail in. But I did so without conviction and the magic didn’t work for me, the nails bent

and never went in properly and I ended up throwing both nail and stone away in disgust.

“Maybe people like you don’t need the Pain Tree,” Larissa had said after my second or
third try.

It was the only time I ever felt uncomfortable with her.

Leaving Larissa’s room, I deliberately left the door and window wide open for the breeze to
blow through and I went outside and stood on the steps of the barracks to get my bearings, for
the landscape had vastly changed. Then I literally waded into the bushes, looking for a cedar. I
had decided to try and find the Pain Tree.

It took me a while and at first I couldn’t believe I had found the right tree for what had

been a sapling was now of massive growth, its trunk straight and tall, its canopy high in the air.

I didn’t expect to see any nail marks, for the place where they had been pounded in
was now way above the ground, but I knew they were there and I kept walking around the tree
and looking up until finally with the sun striking at the right angle — and, yes, it might have been
my imagination — I caught a glint of something metallic and what looked like pockmarks high up

on the trunk.

Standing there, gazing upwards, it came to me why Larissa and all those women had
kept on giving the tree their pain, like prayers. Because they knew no matter what else
happened in their lives, the tree would keep on bearing them up, higher and higher, year after

year.
