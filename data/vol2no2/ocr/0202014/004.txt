abandoned, maidenhair fern and wild fig sprouting from every crack, the roof beginning to cave
in.
I had no difficulty identifying Larissa’s from that long line of doors and though I threw

open the window as soon as I entered the room, the light that streamed in barely penetrated the

dust and cobweb. I went outside and broke off a tree branch and used it to brush some away.

The old iron bed was still there, without a mattress, the wash-stand, the small table and
battered wooden chair. I sat on the chair, as I often did as a child, and looked keenly at the
walls which were completely covered with pages and pictures cut out of newspapers and
magazines and pasted down, all now faded and peeling. This is a part of me, I thought with
surprise, for I recognised many of the pictures as those I had helped Larissa to cut out. I got the

feeling nothing new had been added since I left.

I used to help Larissa make the paste from cassava starch but the job of sticking the
pictures to the wall was hers alone. I brought the newspapers and magazines my parents were
done with, and we looked at the pictures together and argued. I liked scenes of faroff lands and
old buildings best while her favourites were the Holy Family, the British Royal Family and
beautiful clothes. But as time went on, headlines, scenes, whole pages about the War in Europe
had taken over. Larissa now wanted me to read all the news to her before she fell to with

scissors and paste. With the rapidly changing events, even Jesus got pasted over.

The newspaper pages had looked so fresh when we put them up, the ink so black and
startling, the headlines imposing on the room names and images that were heavy and ponderous
like tolling bells: Dun-kirk, Stalin-grad, Roose-velt, Church-ill. And the most important one, the
one facing Larissa’s bed with the caption above it saying: "The Contingent Embarking”. Larissa
and I had spent countless hours searching that picture in vain, trying to find among the hundreds
of young men on the deck of the ship, to decipher from the black dots composing the picture,

the faces of her two sons.

And it was I, then about eight years old, who had signed for and brought the telegram to

Larissa.
