never for one moment wondered what it was she had wanted to give me and turned back for. I

had completely forgotten about it, until now.

I felt shame, not just for the way I had treated Larissa, but for a whole way of life I had
inherited. People who mattered, we believed, resided in the Great House. It was we who made

History, a series of events unfolding with each generation.

And yet, I realised now, it was in this room, Larissa’s, that I had first learnt that history
is not dates or abstraction but a space where memory becomes layered and textured. What is

real is what you carry around inside of you.

This thought came unbidden: that only those who are born rich can afford the luxury of
not wanting to own anything. We can try it on as a way of avoiding complicity. But in my heart

of hearts I know: my inheritance already possesses me.

What Larissa wanted more than anything was the one thing a poor woman could never

afford: beautiful clothes.

Sometimes when she and I had come to paste new pictures on the wall, we went a little
bit crazy and ripped at torn edges with glee, digging deep down into the layers and pulling up

old pages that had stuck together, revealing earlier times and treasures.

“Look Larissa,’ I would cry, and read aloud: ‘Full white underskirts with 19 inch
flounce carrying three insertions of Real Linen Torchon lace three inches wide.’ Three inches,

Larissa! ‘Edging at foot to match. Only ten shillings and sixpence’ .”
“Oh Lord,” Larissa would say and clap her hands, “just the thing for me!”

After our laughter subsided, Larissa would carefully lay down her new pictures to cover
over what we had ripped up. She did it slowly and carefully but sometimes her hands would

pause, as if her thoughts were already travelling.
