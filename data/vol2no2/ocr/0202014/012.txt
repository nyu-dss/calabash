I had the uncomfortable feeling that I should be grieving not for them, but for myself.

People like me would always inherit the land, but they were the ones who already possessed the
Earth.

Before I went back to the house, I spent a long time searching the ground for a nail and
when I found one, I picked up a stone and I went and stood close to the tree and whispered to

it and then I carefully positioned the nail and pounded it with the stone, and it went straight in.
