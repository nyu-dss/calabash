A few days after I had brought the news of Zebedee’s death to Larissa, I saw her walking back
and forth in the yard, searching the ground for something. Finally, she bent and picked up what I
discovered afterwards was a nail. Then she took up a stone and walked a little way into the

bushes. I was so curious, I followed her, but something told me not to reveal myself.

She stopped when she reached the cedar tree and I watched as she stood for a good
while with her head bent close to the tree and her lips moving as if she were praying. Then she
pounded the trunk of the tree with the stone, threw the stone down, and strode off without
looking back. When I went and examined the tree, I saw that she had hammered in a nail. But I

was even more astonished when I noticed there were many nails hammered right into the trunk.

At first, I sensed that this was something so private I should keep quiet about it. But I

couldn’t help it, one day I did ask Larissa why she had put the nail into the tree.

“Don't is the Pain Tree?’ she asked in a surprised voice, as if that was something

everyone knew.
“What do you mean by Pain Tree?”

“Eh, where you come from, girl?” Larissa exclaimed. “Don't is the tree you give your

pain to?”

I must have looked puzzled still for she took the trouble to explain. “Let us say,
Lorraine, I feel a heavy burden, too heavy for me to bear, if I give the nail to the tree and ask it

to take my burden from me, is so it go. Then I get relief.”

“So you one put all those nails in the tree?” I asked, for I could not imagine one person

having so much pain.

She looked embarassed then she said, ‘‘Not all of them. I find some when I come here.

That’s how I know is a Pain Tree.”
“You mean, other people do this?”

“Of course’, she said. “Plenty people do it.” Then she paused and said almost to

herself, ““What else to do’?
