THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL STARS OUTSIDE

There are beautiful stars outside. There are yellow dandelions that look up to the sun. I
have a garden in my backyard. I have no junkyard behind my yard. If someone tells you
that my backyard is filled with rotten food and slashed tires and dead pigeons, tell them
they are lying. If someone tells you that I do not know what consonants are, tell them
they are lying. I have a backyard with no basement. And I have a parrot, green and
yellow that sing operas with the windows open. If someone tells you that there are broken
bottles and dead cats in my backyard, tell them they are lying. I have a backyard with
tomatoes and apples falling from the tree. If someone tells you my panties smell dirty,
that my panties are brown with rust, tell them they are lying. I have a parrot green and

yellow.
