get published and printed under the most virtual economic contingencies imaginable:
CALABASH?’s first three issues were printed on the promise that future sales would be
forthcoming. And they were, but not to the extent that would have made us, or any
journal for that matter, self-sustaining. So, in taking this plunge, in bringing you the latest
works from a burgeoning community of important and dynamic creative artists, writers,
and thinkers via this format, we have merely substituted one virtual reality for another.
Rather than continuing to place ourselves at the mercy of virtual sales during these times,
we have chosen to transform CALABASH into an electronic journal that could
disseminate its pages across the globe with minimum production costs. The fact that
submissions to the journal can also be sent to us online means that the community of
creative artists, writers, and thinkers will expand not only in terms of readership but also
in terms of the ways in which new voices from the Caribbean and beyond will be tempted
and invited to send us their work. We very much look forward to the new possibilities
that this electronic format will provide because we remain convinced that we have only
just begun to scratch the surface of the creative and intellectual work that is being
produced in, around, and about the Caribbean.

Finally, we are keenly aware of the fact that access to computer technology and
the Internet—especially in the Caribbean—should not be taken for granted. We hope that
community libraries might be able to solve this problem. At the same time, we have also
given thought to providing formats that do not require the latest software in order to bring
CALABASH’s pages into view. With respect to the kind of accessibility to creative work
that the journal will provide from now on, I would like to thank all of our contributors—
especially those who are internationally acclatimed—for the generosity with which they
agreed to make their work available in the public domain. I do not hesitate to affirm that,
in keeping with the hopes and wishes of our editorial and advisory boards, they look
forward to engaging readers and writers everywhere.

We eagerly await your responses.

Best wishes,

Editor.
