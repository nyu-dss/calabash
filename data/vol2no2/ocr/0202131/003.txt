“No, I won’t. Nobody’s going to know. Tomorrow, Mufieca, I will buy you your
special clothes.”

“T want panties. I want pink panties and pink stockings.”

I hold Mufieca around the neck and choke her. “Stop asking for so much.”

Mufieca is crying. Her face is getting red. There are tears in her eyes.

I let go of her head and hug her. “I’m sorry, Mufieca. Tomorrow, I will buy you

new clothes.”
