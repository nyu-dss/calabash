MUNECA
eee

All my dolls are called Mufieca. I wish my name was Mufieca. Mufieca is doll in
Spanish. Mufieca is crying on my bureau. Mufieca with the blue eyes is wet with pee pee.
Mufieca with the black hair and bangs is crying because she is hungry. Mufieca with no
clothes is crying because she wants me to rock her and sing to her. I pick up Mufieca with
no clothes and put her in bed with me. I tell her that tomorrow we will go to
Knickerbocker Avenue and buy her some clothes.

“T am going to buy you a pink dress with a little white hat and white shoes.”
Mufieca wants pink stockings too.

“You can have anything you want, Mufieca.”

Mufieca wants panties like Mujfieca with the blue eyes.

“T will buy you panties too.”

Mufieca cries because she wants the clothes now.

“No, Mufieca. All the stores are closed now. You have to wait until tomorrow.
The stores open at eleven.”

“But tomorrow you’re going to be in school.”

“T won’t go to school, tomorrow, Mufieca.”

“But you’re going to get in trouble.”
