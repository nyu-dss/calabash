On Being Long-Winded

yes, iam aware
that sometimes
i talk too much

that i have a ten

dency to take off
on tangents

forget the reason
the instant i remember

to get back to the point

and i know that
sometimes
what i have to say

can be said
within fewer words

"i'm happy."
instead of:

"today, my soul soared
like a red plastic bag

kite let go."

"fuck off." for example
as opposed to:

"look, mista, i got

a loaded pistol

zipped up in my chest

if you make another move
i gwine blow off yo balls."

"yes, that was nice. let's do it again‚Äù
