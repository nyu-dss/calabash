now I have to ask him something which small talk would make easier to ask. And I take
the paper, and I look at him and at the house behind, exploding with misery, and I am
there digging in my pocket for coins instead of keys, and the words catch in my throat
like sand. And do you know what he says to me? Do you know what that brute who
isn’t my husband does before you all come and get me? He holds my hand, so: Nah,
Mistress, he says. You keep it. I can’t make you pay no more. Mistress, you done pay

enough for both of us.
