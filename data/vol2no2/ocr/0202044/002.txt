MISTRESS

He started to go mad the day his wife left him, taking their child Lord knows where.
Nobody knew when she left him, not exactly, but everybody could see that was what
happened. But let me not get ahead of myself. There is much to this story, most of
which I don’t truly know. We would see him on the side of the road, selling papers from
a shed cluttered with bundles of yellowed Nations and Advocates. It used to be he sold
other goods from his front door. That’s when he had a shop, of sorts, and people would
buy bug spray and matches and limes from him. Back then, the clutter extended no
further than his verandah. But since she gone and left him, it’s as if there’s no one left to
hold it all back or keep it in check, all those old papers piling up and spilling out. Selling
papers was always his main business, he couldn’t compete with the shop across the road.
He was an odd man—this man whose wife left him, I mean, not my husband, though he,
too, could be funny. But I’m getting ahead of myself. My husband used to always tell
me I was getting ahead of myself—even though ’!'m much calmer now. This man whose
wife left him had a laugh like a squawk, and he would laugh out loud at nothing at all, it
seemed to me. He might have been going doltish even then. He dressed like a pauper, in
shiny, mismatched clothes that were either too tight or too loose. But he was no fool. He
wrote his figures with a pen in the palm of his hand when tallying a bill for a customer,
and sent the paper money every day down Fontabelle way by one of the Silver Sands
minivan drivers who raced past his shop morning, noon and night. He was a smart
businessman; he just couldn’t compete with the shop across the street, not without a deep

freeze or a licence. And his wife was ugly. There’s no other way to say it. She was ugly
