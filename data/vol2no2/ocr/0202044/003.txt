enough to drive any man mad. She had a mole growing over half her head where her hair
should be. But he married her anyway. It’s them women without airs that does know all
the tricks in bed to bewitch a man. That’s what my husband used to always say. But I
am getting ahead of myself, Pve got to stop getting ahead of myself. Their child was too
sweet, though unmannerly, proof that the fruit doesn’t fall far from the tree. At first, we
didn’t see her, his wife, not for a long time. I don’t know if anybody asked after her. I
know I didn’t; it wasn’t any of my business. But I heard what the people in the
development were saying. She gone to ’Merica. She gone to spend time with she sick

aunt. She gone an’ lef he—he beat she, and de child, too. \heard all the stories; not one
sounded like the truth no matter how close to the truth it came. She and the little girl

gone missing, and for all we knew they could be chad in a gully somewhere, and people
making up stories... This was after a long time. Nobody would ask the man where his
wife and child were. They just took it for granted. So one morning, on my way out to
get my paper from him, I make up my mind. Now I know he can cuss me, tell me I am
too malicious, to mind my own business. But I wake up, make tea, make up my mind
because my husband’s not in yet, and I want to know.... People think [ve got it good,
neither chick nor child, and a big house in the heights and terraces, and I suppose I do.
He doesn’t beat me. He gives me money. We still have sex once in a while. I haven’t
gone to fat like most of the old girls I went to school with. But still I feel sad and lonely
because people think I got it good, and they don’t know because they don’t ask. If I had
a child as sweet as that man’s rude one, I might be more tired and cruel but less sad and
lonely. And I have this feeling, too, that I won’t be seeing my husband again, and in fact
he didn’t come back.... ’m getting completely ahead of myself, can’t help it now. I think
to myself there’s nothing wrong with asking a question. Sometimes, there’s everything
right with asking a question. Maybe I should have asked more when I was a little girl,
then I would know why men and women don’t behave any better even when they’re full-
grown. That may be all that man—the man with the wife and child gone missing, not my
husband—needs, is to have someone ask him where his whole world went, and if it went
when he wasn’t looking or right in front of his eyes. So I put my keys in my nightgown
pocket and walk right out the front door, leaving the stove on and the door open for my

return. When I get to his shed, I ask for my paper—he was never one for small talk. But
