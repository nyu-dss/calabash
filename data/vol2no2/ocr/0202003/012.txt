experience a great deal of pain precisely because of these contradictions. It’s the pull that
we feel between all these different cultures from which we’ve come and which have
shaped us. And we have love/hate relationships with everything and everybody. So it
gives us our “Islandism” [the we discussed in the beginning] and our excitement but at
the same time it also makes it difficult to move -- to sort of transcend this, because we’re
so preoccupied with existence.

D.M.. And I think some of that is tied to the whole cultural values that we were talking
about earlier which are now missing.

O.S.: Yes. It is a different climate now, it’s harder now and young people who are
going to the universities have to be pragmatic and think “I have to get ajob.” There are
just so many things working against the development of national literature in those

places.

J.B.: Can we expect a novel from Olive Senior?

O.S.: Thave written one novel which is in the bottom drawer still and probably will stay
there, but part of my problem is, I don’t have time. I mean I work for a living and novels
require [a lot of time]. I know there are people who have ten children and write at the
kitchen table every night, but that’s just not how I function. I need a lot of headspace.
And all the things I have in my head right now are long books, novels, but I don’t know if
they'll ever get written. I have a lot of things in my head I want to write. I’m interested
in looking at events in the past or time periods in the past that were formative moments.
But I might say that today, this is what ’'m going to do and I might wake up tomorrow
doing something else. Who knows?
