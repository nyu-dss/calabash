contradictions in your characters? Are your characters always contradicted in some kind
of way?

O.S.: think so. I think I was always aware of these contradictions growing up in real
life and I think my stories mirror real life, although they are fictional creations. I think at
a very early age I was very aware of social forces and so when I come to write I worry
about my characters and the narrative and so on but I don’t worry about the background.
I automatically know what the background of each character is --- it’s as if it’s there, it’s
patterned, it’s in my mind. I think I truly understand Jamaicans, in that sense. I suppose
I’ve always been interested in asking “why” which is the most important question for a
writer to ask. Pve always asked myself “why” even as a small child and so ’ve grown
up with a good understanding of how things operate. Of course I’ve also read a lot, and
my reading and everything I do sort of fits in with everything else. When I was doing the
research and writing for [the book] Working Miracles , that helped to inform my
understanding of things that I knew from experience but I also think I was able to put a
lot into that book from my creative self.

J.B.: And having been the editor of Jamaica Journal must have given you a whole
wealth of information. I sometimes think well that’s why Olive Senior knows so much!

(LAUGHTER)

O.S.:. Well yes it did but I also know a lot because I’ve always been a voracious reader.
And as I say, ve always been very curious. I’m tempted to put a picture on the
Encyclopedia of me at age 4 and say this is when my research began. (MORE

D.M. & J.B.: You should...no you should.

O.S.: Pm the kind of person if I don’t know something, even now, I’ll go look it up
because I cannot bear not to know. But there is a difference between growing up in a
society where you just learn as part of the process of growing up as opposed to moving to
somewhere new where you have to start from scratch. And I think this is why I still write
about Jamaica because it is already so much of my knowledge base.

D.M.: That’s true and that’s reflected in your work. You know the names of the birds,
you know the names of the trees and it’s even the way you describe the topography....

J.B.: You have a love affair with Jamaica.
O.S.: Yes, It’s in my blood.
J.B.: What do you think of the idea that contradiction moves Jamaican society?

O.S.: Contradiction is at the heart of Jamaican society. It’s part of what makes the
country exciting but it’s also something that causes such pain. We are people who
