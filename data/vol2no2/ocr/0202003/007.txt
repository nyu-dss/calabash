like 1/3 of the population lives in Kingston and a very significant portion of the
population in Jamaica is under age 14. What are we giving them as adults? What kind of
world are they growing up in? What values are they being given considering that the old

values are broken down and we haven’t replaced them? I just see it as something very,
very complex.

D.M.: Oh it’s extremely, extremely complex. The thing that I feel is that in some way I
have to try to make it better or do something differently to help to replace those [old]
values. How does that happen? I’m not quite sure. But I do have classmates who have
gone back and others who are in training who harbor some ambition to go back and

contribute. So how are you trying to replace some of those [old] values with your writing
especially now that your writing has gotten more socially conscious?

O.S.: Well I’m not sure I myself am consciously trying to replace values. I think that my
job as a writer is to hold the mirror up to society and to say this is how things are. But I
don’t thinks it’s for me to prescribe. I also think though that part of the problem of
countries like Jamaica are the people like us, the people who have left over a long period
of time. We have to see ourselves as part of the problem.

D.M.: How so?

O.S.: Well in the sense the people who leave are usually the people who are educated,
the people with the skills, training or ambition --- and when we leave [we are] draining
the country of [our] talents. Let me hasten to say, I am not blaming people for leaving --
- we all have to follow our dreams. But I personally feel the need to give something
back. And that is why I’ve spent the last twenty years of my life working on the

Encyclopedia of Jamaican Heritage. Because in a way I say, okay, I’m part of the
problem, and this is my way of giving back something.

D.M.. Is that realistic? I have this strange feeling that the average 14 and under youth
will see attempts through literature and writing as some sort of romanticized part of our
history that we can always look back to and say “oh that’s how it used to be.” I get this

strange sense that writing and literature might not be as pertinent to modern Jamaica as it
should be.

O.S.: One has to be optimistic. That’s a very pessimistic view and I’m aware of it.
However, my attitude is that if I can impact just one child, [that’s good]. If one child is
going to get interested and say “Oh I didn’t know this, I didn’t know this, oh wow!” then
itis enough. It is enough because he or she will read this book that is about everything --
history, literature, plants, animals --[the Jamaican] world that I grew up loving and
learning about. So although there are all these other cultural influences that have
penetrated the society, I still believe we have to keep trying. We just have to believe that
there are enough young people out there who are going to make a difference.
