just wrote a whole set of poems called “Islanded” and I think that’s what my young
characters are. I don’t think they reflect Jamaica, they just reflected me and how I felt as
a child [who was] totally alienated from my environment. And although [’m not writing
autobiographically, I think ve infused my characters with my own emotional states and
feelings and so on. They reflected the fact that I felt like an isolated, lonely child.
Totally alienated from adult culture. I don’t know that it’s more than that really.

D.M.: So how would you then address someone who reads your work as somehow
indicative of a larger Jamaican culture? Your work speaks for you as the writer who
wants to break boundaries but at the same time it does seem to fit into certain
categories....

O.S. I wasn’t writing about myself. I was writing about the people around me that I
grew up with and so on. However, I’m just saying that as a writer I infused my feelings
into the writing. I don’t see it from the point of view of the critic who’s reading it, as a
paradigm of something else. That’s not how writers write. So, I’m [not sure if I can]
answer that kind of question. It’s for the readers and the critics to bring that to bear on
the work. I am just telling stories.

D.M.: Oh so they’re stories.
O.S.. Even my poems are stories. I’m a storyteller.

D.M. Interesting that you should say that because it brings up a whole lot of questions,
critical questions, which you say aren’t [necessarily] “writerly” questions, but at some
level, it seems that the writer has to almost consciously say, I’m not going to be a critical
writer, I’m going to be a writer’s writer. How do you make the distinction between just
writing your work as stories and writing them for people? How do you negotiate that?
How do you get your readers to know what it is that you’re trying to convey? To get
what it is that you are trying to say?

O.S. Well, you see, I don’t feel it’s my job to negotiate anything. It’s my job to tell a
good story and to tell it in the best way that I can and to tell it honestly. I see my stories,
or what I do, as part of a half of something and the reader then has to bring something to
bear. It’s a kind of contract between myself and the reader and it’s up to me to be
convincing and to touch the reader in some way. That’s my job. A story isn’t an essay.
People can read politics into it, they can read all kinds of things into it but that’s not what
I set out to put in. I set out to communicate something about one human being to another
human being. That’s what I’m about.

D.M. Interesting. So then who is your audience? The thing about writing is that writers
write, they create. But it seems that writers actually have to create for someone and
sometimes they have to think “How will I market this,” To whom will I target [my
work],” “Who is my audience?” and so ’'m just wondering if you have an audience in
mind?
