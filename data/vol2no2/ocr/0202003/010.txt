characters to speak patois because those were the people I wanted to write about. These
characters arrived with their voices.

J.B.. Another thing I’ve realized is that sometimes you write about characters who are
not really given a say in Jamaican culture. For example, the main character in “The
Arrival of the Snake Woman,” the snake woman herself. How did you think to come up
with that title? Anyway, she’s an Indian woman and she misses her country and she runs
her hand over the map and expresses that kind of longing that I guess I feel here for
Jamaica. But that’s a character that we don’t generally see much of.

O.S.: People have written a lot about that story because that was a sort of breakthrough
for the Indian in Jamaican fiction. I remember meeting Indians in Portugal who read that
story and they said that they were so touched because I had her crying and using the end
of her sari to wipe her eye and they were asking “how could you have known this?” But
the gesture just seemed natural to me. I say I write intuitively because a lot of what I do
is not conscious. It’s not because I think, okay I’m going to have her doing this. My
attitude is that ’'m recording everything as I go through life. And that is what happens.
The fiction or poetry are products of all my life experiences, and you know that life
experiences are not just existential, but it’s what you’ ve read, it’s what you’ve heard, it’s
everything.

J.B.: My three favorites for the record are“ Ballad,” “Arrival of the Snake Woman” and
of course “Discerner of Hearts” and they really do bring out a whole world when one
reads them. But back to “The Arrival of the Snake Woman,” I mean how did you come
up with this Indian woman in the first place?

O.S.: When I was growing up in this little village, there was this Indian woman and
everybody called her “Miss Coolie.” I’ve been roundly criticized by various people for
that but anyway.... She was very old when I was small and I didn’t know anything about
her but she was the village midwife who delivered babies so she might have delivered
me, ’m not sure. But she stuck in my mind and I started to speculate about how this one
little Indian lady came to be here in a village of mainly African-Jamaicans because [she
didn’t seem to] belong there. At the time I knew absolutely nothing about Indians of
course, it’s much later that I realized they’d come as indentured workers. But it is just
from speculating about that woman and deciding to give her a background that I wrote
this story. Of course this story is set much further back in time, it’s set around the end of
the 19" century and the beginning of the 20", but it was just from my imaging, knowing
nothing about this woman, and thinking about how she got here -- that’s where that story
started.

J.B.: Olive, I’ve read these stories and I’ve read these stories (LAUGHTER) and
sometimes I’m totally envious! I wish I’d written “Ballad” because it’s my all time
favorite story in the world! And in another of your stories that I so love, Zig Zag in
Discerner of Hearts, we have these girls growing up with all the contradictions of being a
young girl in Jamaican society. On the one hand, the dark-skinned girl gets pregnant, and
her mother is furious but proud at the same time. So how do you deal with all those
