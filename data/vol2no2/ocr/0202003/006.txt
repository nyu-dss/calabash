D.M.: What about the violence? Is it cultural and how so? In your work there’s a sense
of colonial disorder and imperial order and I'm just wondering is it that the violence is a
natural outgrowth of independence so to speak? That somehow the vernacular culture of
Jamaica is taking over and that there is this [social] tension because the former structures
of class positioning are being upset?

O.S. It’s extremely complex. But I think we tend to forget that violence is ingrained in
our culture from the beginning. Columbus arrived and the first thing that he did was set
dogs on the Tainos. Our history, our written history, is born out of violence. If you look
at who the first settlers were, they were pirates, they were buccaneers, there were slave
owners, and I think that Jamaica had more slave insurrections than any other country in
the new world. So for us to look at violence today as if it’s something new is, I think,
ahistorical. I think we need to see it as a product of colonialism and of our history. Our
failure at managing disputes in the home or larger society. I think what’s different today
is the form the violence is taking and the fact we are now equipped with deadly weapons
of destruction. So now all disputes, no matter how small, are settled not with words or
fists but with bullets. And, of course, there are all kinds of other elements involved, such
as the drug trade.

When I was growing up I suppose there was a lot of domestic violence around me, but if
there was ever a murder anywhere in the country, this was big news. I grew up in a place
where doors were left open. I had no fear as a child, absolutely none. I never, ever felt
threatened or anything. So things have changed. But also I think we have to look at the
root causes of violence. I don’t think it’s a product of independence; unless it’s a
question of independence failing to meet people’s expectations. But I do think it’s a
product of poverty, of injustice, of our failure as a people to provide for the majority of
our citizens. To educate our children. To provide people with the basics of life, I mean
food shelter and so on. Violence is bred out of those kinds of conditions. But what
bothers me about the violence is that there doesn’t seems to be any serious analysis on a
national level as to the causes of violence and our collective responsibility and therefore
we can’t really address it. Collectively we need to examine who we are and where we
want to go, what kind of society, and what kind of culture do we want to create and we
haven’t done that.

D.M.. And why do you think it is that the violence is characterized the way it is? It
seems that there is a rigid class structure that blames certain kinds of people for the
violence, and in the face of the overwhelming amounts of violence that are there now,
why is it do you think that those class structures still prevail? And what are they
supposed to accomplish especially in light of the fact that they are failing?

O.S.: Part of it is that the whole society has broken down in a way at the level of
leadership and there are lots of other factors that we need to look at. For instance, the
impact of migration on the socialization of children. Who is raising those children left
behind? And of course there are serious economic factors which are getting worse and
worse. What bothers me about all of this is the impact it’s having on all the youth and the
children and the kind of world that the majority of them will inherit. I think something
