J.B.: It’s so funny how I found out about you. I’'d almost finished my bachelor’s degree.
I was living in France and I found a book in France that had one of your stories. You
know it wasn’t even here [in North America] it was all the way in France and when I
found it, I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t know that there were writers from Jamaica and I
especially didn’t know there were women writers from Jamaica. I was a junior at that
point in college and it did make a difference in my life to know that.

O.S.: It’s good that you say that because it brings me back to the question of, who I
write for. I don’t write for anyone in particular. My work is read by people all over the
world because I’m really writing about the human condition. ’'m willing to touch anyone
who is willing to be touched by it. But I must say that I’m really pleased when my work
is taught in schools or universities and when young people say to me that they saw
themselves reflected in it, because I grew up not seeing myself reflected in literature. So
from that point of view I’m very pleased that this is happening.

J.B.: There’s another way to look at it also that I have found in my life. Whenever I’m
interested in a topic that topic seems to find me. And I feel that people who want to know
more about Jamaica in the way that Olive Senior writes, will find Olive Senior and will
find the Jamaica represented in your work.

O.S.. Yes. But part of our problem is that in the Caribbean we don’t see literature as
having that kind of impact, we no longer see culture as part of the development process.

D.M.: In Jamaica?

O.S.: Yes. You know, independence was really a wonderful time because we were
engaged in a dialogue then, the whole society. People were talking about things we’d
never talked about before and I found it very exciting and I was really caught up in it.
For a while we were really trying to come to grips with who we were, with questions of
identity. This was when all the cultural institutions, like the National Gallery, and
training schools for the arts were set up, and I think that Jamaica has a terrific history in
that regard. But the way I see it, it was like a window opening or a door opening for a
moment and then it’s slammed shut again. That is what is happening in Jamaica.

D.M.: And what happened...why did it slam shut?

O.S.: Well I think a lot of it is based on political decisions because culture needs money
to survive. And when the economy shrinks, as it has done in Jamaica, then it becomes a
question of how you cut the pie. You need public support for what you’re doing. If the
public support is not there then cultural activities fade away, they die on the vine. But
there also has to be a recognition in the society at large of the need to develop and
promote what’s local. The contempt that local booksellers seem to have for Caribbean
books is a case in point. But ... we haven’t talked much about the writing. ..I mean I
don’t know why you want me talking about Jamaica to get me into trouble!
