D.M.. Well, it’s only because I think that work comes out of a context and work is put

in a context as one reads and it’s important to be able to pull out those things that are
implicit in the text and make them explicit and say well this is what this text actually does

or can do and that is why I ask. (LAUGHTER)

O.S.: Oh understand. It is just that I think we should make it clear that the writer’s
perspective is different from the critic’s perspective. I think part of the problem now is
critics assume that writers write politically. And that, you know, writing is this political
act as if I’m going “this is my post-colonial moment” which is nonsense. I mean this is
something I try to make clear to people, that we writers are coming out of a different
space and it is for the readers and the critics now to bring something else to it which is
not the same thing that the writers are bringing. I do think we need each other, and that
writing develops best in a space where we have critics and reviewers and critical readers.
One of the reasons that Caribbean writing has developed is precisely because we’ve had
institutions like the University of the West Indies and critics who started to write about
Caribbean literature. I think this is a very important part of the process.

I see that anything we as writers do is bound up with what other people are doing. People
of my generation were very much influenced by music and by the voices that we were
hearing. I can remember as a seminal moment the first time I heard certain Jamaican
songs on the radio because these were raw country boy voices. These were not BBC
voices. And I think that was a liberating moment, a liberating experience for all of us
who where being socialized to be English men and women [because] this is what high
school did for you at that time. And suddenly to hear these voices and to hear that
rhythm in the music, I think that had a lot to do with our thinking and the changes that
took place in literature and in art.

J.B.: Olive, I have read all the books and my favorite story in the entire world is
“Ballad” and I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how you wrote “Ballad” because I
remember once you said that you’d been trying for a while and “Ballad” was your break-
through story.

O.S.: Yes, it was. I decided at a very early age I was going to be a writer, when I was
four I would tell everybody, because I learned to read at a very early age. Reading was a
consolation for me and I used to bury myself in books. But I also listened, I grew up
hearing stories, I grew up in an oral culture and I was very, very conscious of words and
the power of words. Asa child I wrote all through school and won prizes, the usual
thing. But although I wanted to write, I just found I couldn’t write using the third person,
objective point of view...it just didn’t feel comfortable. And so that particular
story...that was a break through story for me. It’s when I chose to allow my character to
speak with her voice which was the voice of a little country girl. I came to think of it as
the ‘little tradition’ bursting forth, for, like other people I had been raised on “the great
tradition”, which included the English literary canon. But the minute I allowed that girl
to speak her story, to tell her story in her own words, that allowed me to enter the world
of writing because it just opened it up. And then I felt more confident about allowing my
