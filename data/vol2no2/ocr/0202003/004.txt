O.S. None of that enters into mind. For me what matters is the writing. What I’m doing
here and now. If it never gets published, it never gets published. I consider it my
imperative to write and all these issues about getting published and so on have come long
after I started to write. And I’m not even that concerned about them. I write what I want
to write. I’m not writing for a particular audience. I’m not writing because I want to sell.
That’s not my motivation at all. Pm just fulfilling a need in me to accomplish the most
important thing in life which is to put stuff down on paper.

D.M.: And if that never went anywhere beyond a let’s say self-published copy to your
family, that would be okay?

O.S.. Well, ’ve gone beyond that so it’s not really an issue. However, the thing is [that]
when I wrote my first collection of stories I didn’t think of being published. You know in
North America and in the metropole it’s interesting to see how people approach writing.
It’s very different from how I approach writing. To me writing was something you did
because you had to doit. It had nothing to do with a market. What’s a market? I knew
nothing about that. And I still have this attitude. I teach writing and have students who
have not published anything handing me a card which says, “So-and-so. Writer”. Or I
know people who will say to me, “You’re writing something and it’s not commissioned?
You mean nobody’s paying you to do it?” So my attitude towards writing is, I guess, a
very old fashioned one, which I will not advocate for anybody else, but it is also the

attitude of the people that I grew up with, people of my generation coming from the
Caribbean.

D.M.: And it’s interesting that you should say that because in very many ways what
you are saying [“I write because I write’] is pretty much a luxury these days.

O.S.: l agree that it is a luxury but I don’t think I write because I write. I think you
become a writer because you can’t help it. It’s not a choice that you make, you are
chosen. Its a burden that’s placed on you, and you just fulfill it, you just get on with it. I
don’t see writing as a ‘career choice’ which is the way some people see writing now a
days. I’ve never been to university to learn anything about writing. It’s just part of who I
am. I think ’'m coming from a very different place, than where people now a days are
coming from, in relation to becoming writers.

J.B.: Tagree with everything you are saying right now and indeed as someone who
writes myself I really do understand. So would you say then [that] you are writing to kind
of understand something? For yourself?

O.S.: Yes. I guess [my writing] began as a way of understanding myself. I started
writing merely as therapy, in a sense that I just needed to work out a lot of things about
my identity really, and that’s when I started to write. I didn’t start to write for other
people but in the process of doing that, I discovered not just things about myself but
about my society, about the people around me. So in a way it’s an interrogation. For me
