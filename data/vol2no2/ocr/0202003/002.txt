OF HEARTS REVEALED:
AN INTERVIEW WITH OLIVE SENIOR

It is as if Olive Senior’s first and only pleasure has been in language and the

O.S.: My first book of short stories reflected those kinds of characters but I would say,

looking at the body of my work, I have a much more varied range of characters, though
people tend to focus on the children. And I like the use of the term, “Islanded.” In fact, I
