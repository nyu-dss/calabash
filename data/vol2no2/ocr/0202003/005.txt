writing is an interrogation not just of myself but of my society and I think what has
happened to me is that ’'ve moved away from self. Very little of my writing now has
anything of me in it and that’s deliberate. Whereas, it’s very much concerned with
Caribbean society, both my poetry and everything I do. Because I feel my engagement
now is with the society; trying to explain this society to myself really.

D.M.: That’s actually really interesting because it brings me to the other large issue on
our agenda which has to do with living in North America but writing about the
Caribbean. Why is it that you live in Canada and write about Jamaica from that place? Is
it that you did not want to continue or could not continue to produce in the Caribbean?

O.S.. Well, the fact that I moved out of the Caribbean is really accidental. I sort of left
for a year because I needed a break and the year became two and three. And you know
now it’s become ten. But everything I write is about the Caribbean, I’ve never written
another word about anywhere else. I suppose I was a little bothered by the whole notion
of living in one place and writing about another but then I read what someone said to the
effect * the writer’s country is writing’ and that seems to apply to me.

D.M. That is quite interesting. After all there are all kinds of reasons why it’s difficult
to produce in Jamaica or in the Caribbean. It is a frustrating thing not just because there’s
a lack of resources but because there’s also a lack of critical appreciation for the kinds of
work that people do. But it would seem to me that if writing is the only home that a
writer ought to know and if writing is a burden that a writer must express, then it would
seem that it should be okay for all those writers to stay in the Caribbean because then it

won’t matter where one is placed as long as one is doing what it is that one is chosen to
do.

O.S.: Well to me personally it doesn’t matter where I live because most of what happens
to me, happens in my head. I live inside my head. And I spend a lot of time in Jamaica,
so its not that I am so far away. Besides, I like traveling, I like going around the world,
and I like seeing new things. I don’t think I have to sit in Jamaica in order to write. And
in fact I think Pve had a much better perspective on Jamaica living outside of it because
it has given me some space and distance. I wrote eight books living in Jamaica or seven
books. So it’s not problematic. And I didn’t leave because I could not write there. It’s
accidental that I left. I didn’t leave to leave. I’m still very much engaged with Jamaica
and what’s going on there.

J.B.. Speaking of what is going on there, Olive, there are some questions I want to ask

about your view of life in Jamaica now and I am interested to know what you make of the
crime situation in Jamaica?

O.S.: Well I don’t know if that’s something I really want to go into. Because what do I
make of it? What does anybody make of it?
