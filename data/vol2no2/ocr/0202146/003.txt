Over each contour of his unclothed body.
Long strokes,

He winks at me,

Sharing the secret to the gleaming shine.
Suddenly he turns toward me;

My eyes, still locked

On the troubling movement in his trousers,
Dart quickly upwards.

Sheepishly he clasps his hand

Over his loose, hardening dick,

Eye to eye, grins:

You see I need to pee real bad.

I open the door,

Silently shepherd him into the narrow hallway,
My flank brushes

His blue surface.

He opens the door wide,

Stands over the bowl,

Raising his voice over his noisy stream:
It doh even have a standpipe in de shed.
He offers a wet hand in thanks,
Stumbles for language,

Fumbling in an inner pocket for

An immigration form and an old Bic.
Is so much books you have...

You does like to read...

Hesitates, releases the thought:

You could help me write something?
He makes some halting letters on the page,
Staring into my eyes for guidance,
Pauses;

My left hand, like a child, grasps

The leathery back of his

To form in cursive: I pledge.

Long strokes,

I smile up at him,

Tonight come back

And clean up;

We can finish then

â€” my betrothal.

The rest is ritual:

Every day he comes,
Just once,

Without knocking;

I notice the sound of his
