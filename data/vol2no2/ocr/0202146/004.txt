Frothing piss,

The faucet running,

The moan of his torso against the hot water,
The scrub brush struggling

Through the coarse hair on his chest.

Hearing me stir,

He talks loudly

Through the always ajar doorway —
Some story about home

— Or people from home here.

I enter, without knocking,

To listen,

Sit on the unflushed bowl;

Lazily pick up the sponge:

You back still black.

He shudders:

Long strokes;

Lies in the blackened water,
Eyes closed;

Will not move,

Waiting

Until I reach down

Below his waist —

He rises with a splash:

Without words,

Dries, dresses,

Wraps his arms around me,

Calls me son,

While his overgrown fingers stuff a dollar
All the way into my front pocket,
Slip a quarter in my back,
Scraping his stubbled chin
Against my forehead.

Pulling them out with sweaty palms,
I protest.

Use it for soap,

He insists,

Squeezing all the air out of me.
