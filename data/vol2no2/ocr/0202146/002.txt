Colin Robinson

THE MECHANIC

Long strokes,

He urges, between breaths,
Gently guides my touch
Along his rigid spine.

All the way down.

Down, my fingers think,
Clambering over the dense tufts where
His legs separate:

With a splash;

His muscles rise

Naked in the tub,

Push against my yearning
Sponge.

We both blink

Ourselves back from

This daily brink.

His grease has crawled up under
My raveled fingernails:

He comes here each day,

After hours of work,

Fingering engines to life

In the shed next door,

Sits in the tub;

Tells stories of his wife

And three children back in Carriacou,
The two sons here,

The goats.

He would smile

Whenever he caught me staring

At him from the house.

You does like to watch me work?
He asks last May â€”

Our first words in a year;

In silence polishes the fender he had
Straightened that morning,

The oversize blue overalls
Sliding back and forth
