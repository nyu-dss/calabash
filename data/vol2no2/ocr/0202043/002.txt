SUGAR

Volume 2, Number 2: Summer/Fall 2003

Sugar water for shock

Sugar __ bags in Gopaul shop
Sugar _ sail South China Sea
Sugar sweeten Indian tea

Sugar smooth little Padraicâ€™s hair

Sugar _ stalks stabbing the air

Sugar crumbs Granny table, ants
Sugar cake, flambeaux lamps
Sugar cane, verdant, green
Sugar coating, polio vaccine
Sugar baby, Rossetti locks
Sugar Daddy, Yves St. Laurent frocks
Sugar sweet Margie Riley singing
Sugar still, rum vat rippling
Sugar lump, melting on tongue
Sugar trash, black rainfall over town
