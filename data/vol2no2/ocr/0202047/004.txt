The woman laughed mischievously. “ I don’ know missis.”

“Is what?” Tiny inquired. “Is what?”

Madge laughed loudly and held her crotch, then skipped away. “Hey Sammy that deh
chicken goin’ take the whole night?” Then she returned to Tiny at the counter and did a small
grinding dance. “Soldering missis, soldering.”

“You lie!” Tiny dropped her beer onto the counter and all three women burst into
sustained laughter.

“And if you see the piece a man too. If you see the piece o’ man.” Madge began to snap
her fingers and move her hand against her side as one would when mimicking a jockey on a
horse.

“No wonder,” Tiny laughed “No wonder. I trying to get her since evening.”

“Well, only one somebody getting, and him not here right now.”

“Ts lie! So what him look like?”

“Tt matter!” said, Cherry. It matter? Man a man missis.”

“Not for me,” said Tiny “my man have to look good.”

“You can stay there.” Madge laughed. “My own nah dry up pon me, Missis. Soldering is
soldering. What you say Shirley?”

Shirley dropped her eyes quickly. Each woman there could be her mother but their
conversation was enough to embarrass her. Old ladies who could laugh and make jokes about
men like girls in a bathroom or at a pajama party. Madge was obviously the life of the crowd,
loud and mischievous, expert with at holding a cigarette at the corner of her mouth while she
spoke and worked. She could even laugh with the cigarette there screwing up her face as if
tightening one side of her lips while opening the other side for wide raucous laughter.

She nudged Shirley playfully. “All like how you pretty so, you must pick and choose.
Man must run you down like flies.”

Shirley could only manage a weak smile. The scent of jerk chicken made its way across
the room and made her stomach growl.

“Lend me you phone,” Tiny said. “Make me call her.”

“Make the woman stay,” Cherry said.

But Madge was already searching for the portable phone.

See it pon the fridge top.” Tiny pointed.
