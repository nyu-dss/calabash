“Don’t know what the hell you going back down to that place for.” Madge said seriously,
“Pure old thief down there.”

“Me going back though. No you just say you going back too?”

“Sometime me say so, yes, but me don’t think me could live down there.”

Cherry cut her eyes, “Me, nothing down there. Nothing at all. And every day them kill
somebody else. Me hear say Kingston have to lock up as six o’clock come.”

“Lord. It not so bad,” Tiny said. “Onoo blowing things out of proportion.”

“T couldn’t tell when I go down there,” Cherry said.

“Then how you must know.” Tiny challenged.

“Them Jamaican people too wicked,” Madge said. “The dirty politician them raise up
the price of everything. Hear say one pound a chicken is seventy Jamaican dollar. Three USS
for one pound a chicken, I don’ know how people live. Some people don’t earn seventy dollar a
day. Fucking thief’ politician them.”

“And the people them too,” Cherry said, “Them too stay-bad man. You know why I don’
go down there more often? You have to bring something for every body. And they don’t want
anything cheap.”

“You have to buy NIKE and all them things,” Madge said.

“And you have to bring for every body.”

“And who you can’t bring for, vex with you. Like them give you anything to put down.”

“Is onoo spoil them,” Tiny said.

“Spoil who, ma?” Madge dismissed her. “Jamaican people too wicked man. You know
say I live in America nearly twenty years now, and out of all the letters I get from Jamaica, is
only two of them start off with how you do. The first letter from my father when me come, and
the one from me sister to tell me say him dead. Every other letter start with beg you this or that?
How come you stop send this? How come is Christmas and you only send that? Not even a
thank you. Just begging so. Jesus Christ, they don’ even care if you thief it and give to them..”

“And not to mention the collect call them,” Cherry said. “Every day is another collect
call.”

“Call you collect to beg you something. Me have people call me collect so wish me
Merry Christmas to rass. Up here sick and lonely and have to pay to hear a greeting." Madge

crushed her cigarette in the ash tray.
