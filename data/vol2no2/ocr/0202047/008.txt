who heard her. But Dionne heard the whisper and seemed to guess at what it meant.

“T know what you say you know. I know what you say. And that is why I don’t like to
come here. You always want insult people.”

“What I say?” Madge retorted. “What I say?”

“T hear though. You never hear Shirley?”

“No.” Shirley was beginning to dislike her. “She did not say anything.”

“You stay there take up for her,” Dionne said, reaching behind her to take the plate that
Sam offered. “You stay there take up for her. Me gone to my yard.”

“Go on, you maga like,” Madge said. “Bout you rice and bean.

“Is beans. Is not peas. It’s kidney beans in there. So is beans and rice.” Dionne leaned
into her and kissed her.

“Go on, I don’t want any kiss from you. Go on. Like you ever see ham in Hamburger
Or dog in hot dog”

Dionne turned and swept from the room with her husband.

There was a short silence as the women paused to recover. Her whirlwind of a visit had
sucked all the energy from the room. She had not spent more than five minutes yet it felt like she
had been there an hour. The party had to take a deep breath to start again. And what a party
Shirley thought. One old woman sitting glued to the T.V. set and three others sitting around a
counter playing at pajama party. And she sitting there almost enjoying it, but more hungry and
exhausted than anything, wondering when the food would come, and when Tiny would get tired
so they could get out of there.

“T only hope the one Sam don’ give her all of the chicken,” Madge finally said.

“After me not mad,” Sam said from the patio.

“And you goin’ make we starve.”

Sam appeared with a platter of chicken and placed it in the midst of the women. Cherry
rose and began to distribute utensils from the fridge top.

“T don’ care if you vex,” Cherry said, placing a plate before Madge, “I don’t care if you
vex, 1s you daughter and all, but I don’ like how she talk to you.”

“Lord, is so she go on all the while .” Tiny Said. “If you don’t mind sharp you think them
fighting sometimes. You don’t see how she make sure kiss her before she leave?”

“Don’t like how she talk to you sometimes,” Cherry said.
