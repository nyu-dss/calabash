large living room much like Tiny’s with tasteful furnishing pushed aside to make space for what
must be the dance floor. A woman was sitting watching the television with a Red Stripe beer
bottle in her hand. Tiny introduced them and the woman glanced up to say hello. They moved to
the kitchen where two other women were seated at a high counter on stools drinking Red Stripe
while one eyed a little old man through a glass door, fussing over a grill in the backyard.

As they approached, Tiny was greeted with a roar, and the woman who eyed the man rose
quickly to hug her. “Who this,” she bellowed as if speaking across a bar counter, though they
were standing side by side.

“Is my niece.” Tiny said. “This is my niece, Shirley.”

She was a short brown woman around forty-five with her clothes cut young and tight
around a body that must have been quite exquisite. She wore an ugly wig with coarse long hair
that touched her shoulders.

“Go ‘way.” The woman fanned her hand at tiny go "way. You can have niece good-
looking so. Which part a you have Indian in you family?”

“Ts me niece though. Shirley this is Madge. We call her Madgy.”

Shirley was too amazed at Tiny’s lie to deny her boast. She took Madgy’s hand and
smiled.

“Babs. don’t come yet?” Tiny inquired pulling a stool to the table “Siddung, Shirley man,
siddung.”

But Madge was already steering Shirley towards a vacant seat. “What you want to drink?
A beer? Red Stripe or what?”

Shirley preferred a soft drink and Madge brought her a coke. The other woman at the
table was close to her sixties but seemed as spirited and young as Tiny and Madge who must
have been pushing close to fifty.

“So what happen to Babs.” Tiny insisted as she reached for the beer that Madge offered
her.”

“Lord, what happen to you and this Babs thing so!” Madge leaned against the counter and
nudged the other woman, and they both laughed loudly.”

“Me just want to see her.”

“Well she say she soon come, but a doubt she goin’ make it. What you say Cherry? You

think she goin’ make it?”
