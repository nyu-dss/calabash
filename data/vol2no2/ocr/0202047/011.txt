sadness waiting in the wings. Shirley wondered if this was all there was to it. Was this all that
America gave? Is this what she would turn out to be if she stayed? What was she doing sitting
in a crowd of ugly people out of date and time?

“Make me see it!” Madge’s roar caught her attention as she moved to rejoin them.

“Lot 44 Tamarind Place, Eltham Gardens. Make me see it.” Madge kept yelling as Tiny
rummaged through her bag. “Make we see it man, you love hide too much.” Madge stretched
her hands toward Tiny.

“Lord! wait!” Tiny finally found what she was looking for. “She pulled a small square
photograph from her bag and handed it to the impatient Madge. Madge plucked the photo from
her and looked at it, her face lightened. “Rass, them really work on it. It really look nice.” She
passed it to Cherry who squealed. “And is a nice colour though. But the yard look different
man.”

“But it must look different,’ Tiny said. “Them change everything. Make everything
bigger.”

“Then is how much money so you send go give them?” Madge asked as she lit a
cigarette.

“You too fast,” Tiny said. “Make Shirley look on it now man.”

Cherry handed the picture to Shirley. “Look Shirley, lot 44 Tamarind Place, Eltham
Gardens.”

It showed a medium sized blue and white house built like a hexagon. It was nicely done,
in green with Grey and white trimmings. The yard seemed a bit small, but Shirley realized that
the house had not ben built that size. Originally it was half the size but additions and renovations
had been made and now it stood beautifully and tastefully done. The fence was made of
whitewashed wood designed in small hexagons. “It’s very nice,” Shirley said.

“You like it?” Tiny smiled.

“Then how Shirley is you niece and don’t know it. And everybody here know lot 44,” the
rest of the women joined in “Tamarind Place!” The room burst into laughter “She don’t stop beat
it in we head.” Madge teased.

“Is my house,” Tiny ignored her. “Me moving down next year.”

Shirley was almost at a loss for words. The simple, smiling, out-of-date woman had a

plan.
