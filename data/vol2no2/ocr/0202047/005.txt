“Make the woman stay. Why you want interrupt her?” Cherry spoke without conviction.

“Interrupt her yes.” Madge seemed a little tipsy. “She should reach here long time.”

Tiny dialled quickly. The other women waited eagerly pushing their faces toward the
phone at tiny’s ear.

“What happen to you.” Tiny inquired into the receiver. She listened a while then smiled
mischievously at Madge “Is after ten now man, what you doing so long getting ready.” She said
into the phone again.

Madge made the jockey motion against her leg.

Tiny listened then continued into the phone. “But everybody hear waiting on the you
man. You coming or not? I want to ask you something.”

“Or you done come?” Madge shouted toward the phone. Cherry almost fell off the stool.
Tiny was barely able to suppress her laughter. She placed her hand against Madge’s shoulder to
push her away from the receiver. “I bring my niece to meet you. So you coming?” She waited a
bit then looked across the room at the clock on the wall “Is a little after ten. You coming? ...
Alright you know, we waiting. I want talk to you about something. .. Make sure you come.”

“And don’t stop come.” Madge shouted again toward the phone. But Tiny was already
clicking the switch. “How you so out of order man?” She shoved the phone at Madge with a half
smile. “You don’t even know how to behave yourself. You don’t see Shirley?”

Madge took the phone “She probably deh pon it all the while she talking to you.”

“Yes,” Tiny smiled. “She did sound kind a funny fi true.”

“Whoa,” Madge laughed, held her crotch and danced across the floor. “Soldering.”

The doorbell rang.

“Wonder who that now?” Madge composed herself and moved across the room.

Tiny smiled at Shirley “Don’t mind her you hear. Is so she stay.”

Shirley smiled weakly and finished her soft drink. She wondered when the food
would be ready. She also wondered where were the plenty young people her age that Tiny said
would be there.

She watched Madge make her way to the door. Her body wriggling in the dress
as seductively as a fifty year old body could in a dress that was a bit too tight on a body that had
become much too soft to resist the pressure of the belt against it. She was not fat, but age had

redefined the curves of her body, and the dress that would have made her irresistible fifteen years
