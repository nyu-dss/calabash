green card so him gone. Don’t even want to work, say him not working till him get him green
card. Say him waiting till him can get good work. Now him living off people and going on like
him better than anybody.”

“She must go on better though man,” Tiny said. “Is one mother she have.

“Goin’ go home and leave them rass” said Madge “Goin go home and leave them.”

“You not going anywhere,” Tiny said to her. “You not going anywhere. Look from when
me tell you to fix up the little piece a house you have out there- make we go home. All now, you
don’ even move a finger.”

“Well one day I goin’ move.” Madge looked behind her “Hey Sammy, leave what you

on the stool.

This was some party, Shirley thought. If Tiny had meant to lift her mood by inviting her,
she had failed. She had expected to at least find a bunch of old women playing bingo or

something, not this raunchy lot, laughing loudly and raucous, as if desperately trying to delay the
