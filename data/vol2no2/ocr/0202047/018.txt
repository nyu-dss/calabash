tears. But her voice had a small crack to it. “I’m coming now,” she said. “Wait a minute, I’m
coming.”

“Alright,” Tiny said. “Me inside when you ready.”

She pressed the heel of her palm along her face, scrubbing from her eyelid down her
cheeks, massaging her skin with her palm. The tears were gone, but close scrutiny would tell.
She composed herself.

It was time.

She had not cried from so deep inside since she was a child and her father had left and
did not return.

It was time to return, time to go home.

“When you going home Shirley?” Madge and the group had migrated to the living

room to join the other woman. The TV was going full blast. The centre table held glasses. A
bottle of white rum had appeared in her absence. Madge stood and held her hands. “When you
going home you must tell me, you hear? I have a box a want you carry for my sister, just few
things.”

“T’ll remember.” Shirley said.

“And I have one too.” Cherry squealed from across the room. She was sitting on the other
side of the rooster.

“Remember you know,” Madge smiled. “You so nice and quiet. You see how we out of
order some time?”

“T enjoyed myself, I didn’t mind.” Shirley said.

“Alright, pass by again, before you leave.” Madge released her. “Come look for the old
lady.”

“Alright, we gone.” Tiny started for the door.

The ride was quiet for most of the way back. Shirley was a bit surprised, but she was
grateful. Tiny drew into the yard, parked and shut the engine down. For some unknown reason
both women sat silently in the parked car and looked uncomfortably through the windscreen.
Shirley had planned to jump from the car as soon as it stopped. But something held her there and

Tiny did not move.
