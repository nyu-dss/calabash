“Make she go on with her piece o’ dry up husband.” Madge said, “Me no know if
somebody can call something like that husband.”

The women laughed. The mood began to return. In the half hour or so Shirley had been
there, it had swung from high raucous laughter, to a half embarrassed silence. Now it came
down to a gentler mood that she could deal with. Madge’s raunchy laugh and red jokes had
made her uncomfortable. She had never met anyone like her, like them, these old ladies sitting
loose and unafraid of expressing themselves in the grossest of fashions.

But Dionne’s entrance and exit had brought them down and had given Shirley a different
sort of embarrassment. She sensed love turned inside out and flung back. It had made her quiet,
and she momentarily wondered, if one, looking on as she was, as the scene between mother and
daughter played out, if one, seeing her and her own mother, would be filled with the sense of
disgust at her that she had felt at Dionne. But Shirley had never talked to her mother like that—
had never gone in, taken, insulted and left. She reacted to her mother. Dionne acted upon hers.

have one mother.”

“Them!” Cherry shrugged and finally sat, “Them young people mi dear, them don’ care
bout one thing.”

“IT going home and leave the whole o’ them. Make them rass suffer.” Madge said, her
mouth half full. “Going sell the rass house, put them out 0’ door. Sell the rass house them. See
where them going to come and look for food. See where them goin’ live and don’t pay rent.
Husband dry up no rass. Probably can’ even fuck . . . batty flat like.”

“Lord Madge man,” Tiny bellowed, “behave you self.”

“Lef? me yah woman, look from when them say them married and can’t even have one
pickney.”

“Then suppose them not ready yet,” Tiny asked.

“Three year and don’t ready? You no see that is a board man.”Madge looked around for
her beer.

“TI am not fasting,” said Cherry, “Is your business, but I think maybe him don’t want have
children with her. Him is a show off fellow. Them high colour people don’t like have children
with nothing too black. And him come from good family too.”

“Mi tell her that all the while,” said, Madge “fucking boy just using her. As him get him
