for Miami.

And now standing there in the warmth of its night amidst the smell of burnt meat, she
wondered if it really existed. Where was Miami? That place she was made for, that was made
for her, that would embrace her — lift her by her positive attributes to a higher plane and
maximize her. Where was the life? Where were the things? Where was the hope?

She saw once, she admitted, saw the glitter for a night, saw the boys half naked skating
carelessly on a silver street where tourists passed twenty-four hours, and music was the
atmosphere. Saw it once; beautiful cars and carefree people gliding by — exotic foods — tasted it
too, tasted Miami. Or did she? Did she ever experience Miami? Did she experience Miami? Or
did she see it passing by?

She sighed again and shook her head to clear it. She was going mad. She smiled sadly as
she walked to the corner of the yard, where it linked with another, and squinted along the fence
to the street outside. There was loneliness in Miami. There was poverty and dread. There were
old lonely women in Miami and old men with false teeth playing rooster to them, as they
stretched back through a fog of lost years for a joy they left somewhere far behind. There was a
fear she could not fathom. The fear these people had — these people, shouting uncertainly,
making rude jokes, laughing too loud, shifting in and out of moods with fear in their eyes —
fighting to get some light, any light, in their lives — laughing at things they probably would not
have tolerated ten years before — twenty years before, as if they must be happy, must be good,
must keep light; fight for it, demand it, reach for it with uncertain trembling hands — so they may
keep away the pain in their eyes, that suspicious furtive look of one being hunted, one keeping
their guard up, knowing that sadness was always there, constantly, lurking in the wings.

Sadness lurking in the wings, Jesus Christ she was a poet now.

Things disappear in Miami, nights disappear, days disappear when you go to sleep. She
shivered slightly. And thought of her mother. She must be sowing now, probably gone to
church, Saturday evening Sisters ’s Meeting. She would never turn her back if she returned home
now. She would grunt, maybe give those eloquent silences. And now that Shirley had returned
defeated, she would probably feel a greater sense of authority, probably feel the need to make her
points known more. She could be bad, but not so bad. She would never turn Shirley away,
never humour her.

She could return.
