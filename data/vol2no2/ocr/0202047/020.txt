the car.

“T didn’t say that,” Shirley said. “Babysitting you say?”

“Yes,” Tiny said. “It pay about two fifty a week, but you know Babs have to

get her twenty or so... . because is her job. But it better than nothing.” She pushed the
paper across the top of the car.

Shirley took it slowly. “Pll think about it,” she said.

“Yes.” Tiny was sober. “But tell me if you don’t want it, so me can tell Babs.”

“OK,” Shirley said, “I will.”

“Alright then,” Tiny said, as she turned towards her door, “Well alright. Me gone in. It
look like is some stale beer Madge did have in her fridge. Me gone in.”

Shirley did not have the first words to say to the disappearing back.

And so it was, that the following Monday morning, Shirley Temple Brown

walked to the modern guardhouse of the Coral Estates Golf and Country Club and asked
to be directed to the home of the Williamsons. She was given a computer print-out that had the
full address and directions into the vast property. Twenty minutes later she stood in a large
driveway, that sliced through immaculately cut grass, at the huge door of the largest house she
had ever seen, and rang the bell. She heard a window crack, saw a curtain move and glimpsed
the excited face of a blond child peeping through. The curtains fell and she heard a patter of

little feet and an excited scream, “Mummy, mummy, mummy, the new maid is here.”
