and shy smiles. One would never have guessed at the kind of conversation that just transpired.

“So how the party going?” Babs asked, as she looked around for a stool. There were only
four and they were occupied. Tiny rose quickly and offered her seat to Babs.

She made Tony sit down. “Me use to the place already,” She said.

Now Tony was in the midst of them and Cherry was trying to size him up shyly while
Madge stared him straight in the face. “Have a nice piece a man here though Babs,” She said
jokingly “No bother leave him careless.”

The group laughed and Tony pretended to be bashful. His false teeth protruded slightly.

“This is me niece a telling you about.” Tiny introduced Shirley to Babs. Babs had a
broad friendly face with a serious business like mouth. She sized up Shirley quickly and her
eyes took on a momentary seriousness, then she smiled. “How you do Shirley,” was all she said.

Shirley rose and shook her hand. Babs moved toward the fridge and Tiny followed her
quickly, “I want talk to you about something,” she said.

Shirley took the opportunity to step away from the counter. She needed some fresh air.
She walked past Sam at the edge of the patio, through the screen door, and past the smoking grill
into the small grassy backyard. The scent of food from home mixed with the warm night air.
She lifted her face, closed her eyes, breathed deeply and sighed, Miami.

She tried to remember the first time it had occurred to her to come there, the first time the
word had fixed itself in her head as a refuge to go to. It may have been that first time she saw
Mark, or that first date when they sat at Heather’s and he had looked at her over shish-kebab and
told her “You belong in America.” Maybe it was before that, maybe it was the distant memories
of her father calling her a movie star, or the several days she spent before the TV watching
Miami Vice and Falcon Crest. It could have been any time, it could have been the day when she
realized Mark was not coming back or the first evening she ran her fingers on the lace of
Victoria’s Secret lingerie. It could have been any time, she could not remember. But she could
remember the feelings throbbing in her like a hunger she must satisfy. She remembered lying at
times in her bed, squeezing herself tightly so as not to tremble with the vision of it, the yearning
for it. She could hardly grasp it now, that passion that overwhelmed her— consumed her so. For
consumed her it must have, because, thinking back, she could not see the logic of it, the sense of
casting all she had on a throw of a dice. It must have been some passion, some yearning. For she

had left it all, sold it all, abandoned her friends her mother — her life — and boarded a sliver bird
