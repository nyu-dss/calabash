ago, now seemed a bit ridiculous. The waist gathered as if it had too many pleats and the fabric
did not bounce but was dead against her slip. If Shirley had not been so hungry she would have
probably laughed.

A slim young woman much darker than Shirley but about her age, in a nurse’s
uniform, bounced past Madge into the room and paused momentarily to pat the woman watching
TV in the living room. “Lord Ivy. You and the T.V. How you can watch TV so?”

“Tell you say young people coming.” Tiny smiled at Shirley as the young woman
bounded across the living room. Madge trailed her as quickly as she could. Behind them
walking slowly was a slim man, almost white with thin hair and a large cigarette stuck in his
mouth. He was so thin, the beltless jeans he wore, seemed on the verge of slipping past his hips.
Shirley watched as he sauntered across the room, and stood facing the kitchen without so much
as acknowledging the people there. He seemed washed out and tired. Yet he stood with a
haughtiness of one above all that was before him. Mark would have looked something like that
she thought, if he lost all his money and didn’t eat for a year.

The young woman bounded to the counter and hugged Tiny tightly. “Tiny, what
happen?”

Tiny laughed “Nothing. A bring me niece to meet you.”

“Which niece?” she said, looking at Shirley, “You can have niece pretty so!”

Madge laughed forcefully.

Tiny smiled. “Shirley, is Madge daughter this. You see how she go on just like
her. She name Dionne. That is her husband Phillip.” Shirley shook Dionne’s hand and watched
as Phillip made a small nod. He seemed to scorn the very ground on which he stood.

“Me tell her that young people her age would come.” Tiny said to Dionne.

“Lie she telling.” Dionne said. “No more young people not coming. And me not
staying. Just come to get little food.” She pointed her nose toward the grill.

“You and you long gut.” Madge said.

Dionne passed the counter and went straight for the fridge. In the minute or so
she had been there she had completely taken over the proceedings. She was slim with a fading
beauty. Too many lines in her face for her age, Shirley thought. But she had the abundant
personality of her mother. She crossed to the fridge and found a soft drink “You want

something Phillip?” She beckoned to her husband.
