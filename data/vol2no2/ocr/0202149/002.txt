This the song

of Deveaux House, how
its mouths moan.

The Bight, the Creek,
song of Guanima.

Big Blue Hole.

O Cat Island, you is
mine and not mine.
Make me heel

and toe my trouble
to the saw, spirit
whetting cutlass;

concertina, gull laughing.

Let obeah quadrille

the hair on God neck.
Take my heavy load

and lick it: make do
make do make do.

Old friend, come scratch
my back.
