A FISHERMAN’S TALE
eee
Chorus

Pious birds who, fed by the boatswain’s hands

while he sang falsetto notes,

lend me your feathery lobes, bring idle wings to bear

on the prows of these lands.

Beast or man? a howl exceeds stealthy caves.

And now upon the scene, sharp as a wounded knee

a shipwrecked hobbling god, the ecclesiastic priah,

this incubus I love, who will not leave the sea amour lonesome.
O’ beware! I see him gain favor upon a wet wasteland--
native like any gull at Rio Buenos

where the fat women go to sing

on this weird Caribbean isle, orphans of the Antilles—

our island comprise of pirate skulls=—

here my father’s spirit debates with saffron foam.

His meticulous breed spreads from coast to coast--

high forehead man whom mother- woman bless with rose water
and bare rum and coconut oil.

On his shoulder a fishnet, and his face is sun burnt still.
Leather sandals bound his toes, the trousers girt his hips.
Silence pelicans, silence! let him speak-- drowned throats
offer much sorrow and birds cannot content with sorrow--
but be still a moment and let him reveal

the human error that doomed him in this manner.

Tell your story my parent; let the whole world grieve with you:

Fisherman (painstakingly turning from the sea, wading from the water as if just returning
from a recent expedition)

Old men are no more dead,

unearthed a poor Ned from his rest

let the tongue out from my lungs.

Pity the sickled moon in my lonesome breast—

I’ve seen things boy,

old years gathering in me like tulip bulbs.

Boy these shoulders have not rest
