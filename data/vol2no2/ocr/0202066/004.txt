In the dire streets your parent roamed, disheveled
and induced with sorrow’s nectar.
At first I took the homebound path, and the sight of you weeping

made me abandon the cause. I fished upon my father’s knees
I know nothing better than the relentless sea, I have no salt--
alas the open sea is all.

It was here I made the call, on this sea-rock with its third eye.

Oh, sorrow, you encase me with your bribery, your saliva wallow in me still.
Where is their edict now, now that death claimed the flesh I once owned.
What laws is there than can rival God’s own decree

the hurricane still breathes, typhoon splits the ship---

God! now all Ihave is your still judgment, your edicts never fade

though man may forget his own edicts when it favors him to do so.

Chorus
O’ be still O’ soul, the incubus seems to fade shimmering perspectives
like the sun on the table of the sea.

Nearer, nearer still—I mean to know my father’s will.
Reconcile your loses, father, (if I was there you would never have plunged)
recall to your mind that suit wearing man, hobbling pirate
whose incursions filled the beaches with hollow bricks
displaced our kinder-folks.
He is the culprit, not you my father, not you, O’ saint of seas.
Return to your cave, all maladies will ease with dreams.

Fisherman
Too late, too late for fro my journeys IJ learned the truth--

no, Permits are not from God, and I should have lived,
I took the course to Sheol, and the sin has doomed me
living lighthouse my eyes reflects the sea, I watch day and night with no reprieve.

Chorus
The spirit wanes
the sea rustle a blanket to cover mistakes
another speech this way comes.
Why did you leave me bereft of love?
the temperance in your fingers made me grasp the pen.

I am scaled without the shade of your arms.

Tomorrow I will bring you palms to shade your porcelain face.
The sea rolls through your hips seal-like on the beach.

Bobbing birds watch! the ghost repeats the act--

he drinks upon the white sheets of foam
until is covered whole.
