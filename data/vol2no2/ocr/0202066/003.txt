for I must haul these sea nets even in death
until released by this said sea

whose mourning I placate with verses you taught me.

Many morns over the sea-sprayed-cliffs

I carried you in friendship to greet the be speckled eye

to teach you lineage as only the sun knows.

The sea sported her barnacled robes

and the gay town wakes from its ashes.

The old Scottish kilt Thermos filled with Blue Mountain coffee
sweetened with condense milk and brown sugar.

Some bobbing birds together dallied on its rolling flank,
and countless fishermen bellowed from her jaws—

methinks the day unending, tastes of fried crisp snapper
sweet festivals under the stones of Lovers Leap.
Tall-man’s potion would fill our lungs until the day is done.

Ahh, sea who unravels sailors’ knots

I recall you, attend, and resurrect the man I was

who rode the crest of yon shoulder sprays.

I left wife and child furlongs behind.

I abandoned the pit of my boat with fishhooks and snares.
Here I alone stood the lighthouse my sole companion.
Alas, my self-pity is without warrant, my tears undone.

I alone braced the bulk of the heavy chains

when our shore was divided among the foreigners.

At first we schooled together, fishermen of every creed,
but most took the deed and the penance that came with it.

They fled the beach, left the shores in desolate mourning.

I would drink the winy sea than leave the shores my fathers thrived.

I could not fish the sea, I could not roll my net upon the sand
neither could I clean the snares or bait the hooks.

The beach had become sterile they combed it day and night
removed all its vestments, cast them into the wind.

There was not room for men here, trees assembled brave as warriors.

But soon they hauled them down and in their place constructed strange totems

idols permeated the sand, coconuts harvested to feed burdensome throng.

One night I meant to haul my skiff out to sea, I came to see lay mauled

my instruments broken no more use to me.

I raged on, on below the indifferent moon, brought my quarrel

to the owners of the mansions, the redneck fellow
who wears doubled breasted suits under our yellow sun.

Oh, it came to blows, they beat me out of town naked. I ran for cover.
