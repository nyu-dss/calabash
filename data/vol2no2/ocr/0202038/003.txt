CHIRPING CATHEDRALS

In eclesiam.
In eclesiam.
In this house you will find Love
cardinals, hydrangeas and archbishops
hung by their wings,
from a thousand bed sheets of fire.
And inatender friction,
you'll find atoms hissing
in the tinyness of insects
burnt to dust by a lightbulb
burnt by volts of enlightenment
by a search
in a prayer extending like a serpent to heaven
in the love murmured by refrigerators

to the cathode

the anode

to the toy with no batteries in the backyard
to the clothesline with no laundry
to a city without its birds of steel
without the sizzling of winged creatures on cables
without kites or bindweed
or hawks melting
in the whip of energy
in the Kilowatts of their own trills.
Their chants nourished by a three-phase current,
glowing like the heart of Jesus
with twinkling sharp thorns, flashing
drops of sacred anti freeze fluid.
Tam the temple, they tll,
The Cathedral of Megavolts.

In me Truth is confused.
