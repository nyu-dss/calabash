mouth and a hole down there, so I could give her water or milk in a bottle and then she
would pee it out and she had diapers that I had to put on her.

She had twisties around her neck and around her ankles and wrists. She had a big
one around her waist. I asked my sister to do it. But she tried one and couldn’t do it and
she just left the doll on the sofa. I went to my brother to help me, but he told me to give it

to Mami to do. But I don’t want to ask Mami, because Mami hates the twisties.

So I tried to do it by myself. I twirled the twisty little by little. I got the twisty
around the wrists out. There was a little red mark on my finger now. But it wasn’t a cut
like Mami’s. I untwisted her other wrist and then her ankles and then her neck. I got her
out of the box. But then I put her back in again. I wrapped the twisty around her neck and
tied her to the box again. I tied her wrists and ankles and waist again. And then I started
from the ankles and untwisted her again. I took her out and told her that she had to go in
the box again ten times because that’s the only way she could come into my house and
play. She didn’t want to go back in, but I pushed her and told her not to make noise or
else I'd tie the twisties harder. She started to cry so I tied the twisty around her neck real
tight. I twisted and tied and told her to shut up and when I looked at my fingers, they
looked a little like Mami’s. There was a line, but no cut. It was just red and pink. When I
touched it, it hurt and burned. I bit my finger to make it redder, but the lines were not like
Mami’s. I only had bite marks. I put the doll in again and told her I had to twist and tie

her in the box 100 times more, before she could come and stay at my house.
