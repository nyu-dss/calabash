IMAGINING

i sit, in this chair

of wicker and of wood,

outside on the open gallery

of this rented house, two months

behind, from that cheerless night

she left,

with a “‘cohiba” alight,

and read walcott, our poet, late into the night.
there is no rum the match of “el dorado”, gold,
the amber spirit from that country

where the coast lies, below the level of the sea,
guyana. alone

my choice on this night

in the half full moon, light

facing

the distant ocean, - we keep calling the caribbean sea -,
