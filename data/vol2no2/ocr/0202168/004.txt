against the cobalt blue, gliding
with the gentle current, softly
slow, and in a moment gone. flown

to another feathery band, nearby

little cottony puffs remain to drift, and later
no trace, but memory. smoke

burt in. memory.

as a ship silhouetted against the night

sails by. and from the verandah i go,

in to bed

my dream.
