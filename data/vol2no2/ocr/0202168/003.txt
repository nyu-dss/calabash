shimmering
bright reflection shadowing the night
sky, no mere silver halide negative

this starry positive, unframed. here

i call her love, and

summon her from the blue, erzulie,
erzulie frida

“please come to join me, back ”

and in the coiling cloud of my cohiba

smoke, i see her form

smoke into memory,

memory into smoke, memory is
smoke. i see her wet,

from the water. dripping ringlets, dark

skin smooth, a woman full

lips in perfect pout, and a nose from distant
ancestry, as distant as those eyes

now close, that smile and see

deep

into my soul. clear
as this bird cloud i watch
form at the fancy of the wind, and stay,

wings now spreading

out in flight
