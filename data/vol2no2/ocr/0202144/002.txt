Life:(Un)Titled

I’ve tried to edit my life into just good verses
of my existence, but life isn’t a great poem
So a bad stanza or two will live in the piece

An indentation for my childhood
a run-on sentence for my adolescence
and a semicolon for puberty

Italics on my education
bold type for my first and last love
and underlines for the importance of family

Spanglish and an upside down exclamation point for heritage
a grammatical error for neighborhood
a coma after 14, 21, and eventually 30, to keep life going

Pll make the font either Arial Black or Impact
so it can represent my ego, then
Times New Roman size 11 to show growth

Pll break life mid-sentence, 2 breaths per page
an asterisk for a song lyric
representing a period in me

I'll keep it single spaced, so the words don’t
out live the life in length and I'll keep the poem
on the left side of the page,

because I tried to stay on the left side of life
but once in a while a moment or word can stray right
trying to be free verse

No meter in my lines
Rhyming was never a strong point for me

Chicago knows they have jokes for my freestyle sessions

Wingdings to represent my outlandish behavior
a period to show closure for my animosity for my father
