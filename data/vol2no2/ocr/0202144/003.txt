a question mark for my career

A haiku to show how I should be in life
An epic on how I tend to be
Simplicity is something Iâ€™ve strived for

There will be five parts to this piece
by the time I expire in breaths and heartbeats
NYC, Chicago with sub-sections, Love, struggle

And the fifth yet to be titled, but itll be
multilingual to show my pilgrimage back
to Puerto Rico, Latin America and my love for travel

And in the end there will be
no pseudonym,
no moniker,
no Graff tag,
no hip hop title,
no acronym,
no performance
no Puerto Rican with hair who loved
rock and roll and Che Guevara
no Bonafide,
Hopefully no regrets (hopefully)
