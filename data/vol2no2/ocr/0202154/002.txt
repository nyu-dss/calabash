At 42"¢
I descend the lower ramp
to catch the 7,

pass the friendly leg-less man

in his wheelchair,

irritated that he’s always friendly
and always there,

feel a pain under my arm

and a pull in my bicep
metastasizing me to the grave—
these past five down days—

is it holidays?

Is it chemical?

Did I eat enough protein for breakfast?

People on both sides of the platform
waiting—
I hear bongos louder and closer—

the drummer, dark, thin

wearing glasses, a shabby black jacket
and pants.

I imagine taking off my winter coat
and furiously dancing

right here on the platform

then decide he’s not very good;
he can’t hold a pattern for any length of time.

Five minutes of drumming,
plenty of people, yet

not one has approached

his open black case—
probably a crackhead,

doesn’t deserve it anyway—but
what the hell.

I zip open my purse
