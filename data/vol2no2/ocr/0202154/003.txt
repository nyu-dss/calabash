and dig down for change,
two dimes and a nickel

(that’s not enough) dig for
another quarter—teflect

it takes just one person
to set the train in motion.

I drop my little load

in his big black case.
He gives me a smile;

I give him a thumbs-up
walk away and hear

a clink of change behind me.

I board the lucky 7.
