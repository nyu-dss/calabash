Who’s using who

In this power dynamic

struggle of race and culture

Who’s using who

27 years of your life

fresh and vibrant

you had dozens and dozens of years
to paint your heart out to show people
What it meant to be a painter

a black painter

Tell me Basquiat?

How does it feel

to be a tainted immortal in a art world
that whispers under their breath

and says all you did was scribble

But you inspired me

to paint slogans of poverty

and anti-capitalist lines

over America’s dream of art imitates life
showed me to paint with a marker
draw on doors

sketch on the subway

showed me that graffiti is ART

It’s the same old song
It’s the SAMO song

Tell me Jean Michel?

How does it feel?
