your soul on the street and be a little famous
to paint your acid tripped LSD on anything

then you were tapped by

art gallery dealers who represented you
wheeled and dealed for you

but did they have your voice, your interest
they knew they could make a lot of money
off of you and they slaved you

Your output was phenomenal

dozens of paintings

flying out of your hands at the hands

of these dealers who dealt pieces of

your soul to people who just wanted

a piece of the hype

then itâ€™s your relationship

with Warhol Jean Michel
Your collaboration with the
Intergenerational pop icon

who was inspired by your energy

I know you idolized Andy

The one man who embodies contemporary
You desperately wanted his approval

You two were inseparable

working and partying together

Warhol never joined you

in your escapades of drugs

but he watched you

in your youthful abrasiveness
Was he sincere in telling you

he like your paintings?

Or did he snicker the way he did?
Was he man enough to say you
had more raw untapped energy
than he ever would?

Did he Jean Michel?

Warhol built you up

then broke you down

A white pimp with a black painting whore
in a downtown art scene

made of leeches and snakes

painting their lives away
