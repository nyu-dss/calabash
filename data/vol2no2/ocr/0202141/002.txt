BASQUIAT

So tell me Jean Michel?

How did it feel to be pedestalized

then pick-a-nannied, 1982

a Haitian Puerto Rican

in a pop art world on a raft by yourself,

Volume 2, Number 2: Summer/Fall 2003

displayed in galleries in Munich, L.A. and Tokyo

but what about The Lower East Side
the same old song of SAMO

slogans tell your life on brick walls of Loisada

Lithographs, wood, canvas cutouts
sketched with black marker Pilots

house painted your devotion for

Dali and Picasso

Showing your true colors for your heroes
Charlie Parker, Joe Louis,

Muhammad Ali and Roberto Clemente

How did it feel Basquiat?

Being the only black man
Graffiti writer

Turn talk of the art world in less than a year

From chalk floors to oils

jessoed in basement studio spaces
with hills of cocaine next

to buckets of white paint

you tried to stay sane

inherited the love for the moment
in these days of excess

addicted to painting your torture
breaking your bones slowly
breaking your spirit slowly

but all you wanted to do is paint
